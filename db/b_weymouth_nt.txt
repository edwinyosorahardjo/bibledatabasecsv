23146	40	1	1	  The  Genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
23147	40	1	2	 Abraham was the father of Isaac; Isaac of Jacob; Jacob of Judah and his brothers.
23148	40	1	3	 Judah was the father (by Tamar) of  Perez and Zerah; Perez of Hezron; Hezron of Ram;
23149	40	1	4	 Ram of Amminadab; Amminadab of Nahshon; Nahshon of Salmon;
23150	40	1	5	 Salmon (by Rahab) of Boaz; Boaz (by Ruth) of Obed; Obed of Jesse;
23151	40	1	6	 Jesse of David--the King. David (by Uriah's widow) was the father of Solomon;
23152	40	1	7	 Solomon of Rehoboam; Rehoboam of Abijah; Abijah of Asa;
23153	40	1	8	 Asa of Jehoshaphat; Jehoshaphat of Jehoram; Jehoram of Uzziah;
23154	40	1	9	 Uzziah of Jotham; Jotham of Ahaz; Ahaz of Hezekiah;
23155	40	1	10	 Hezekiah of Manasseh; Manasseh of Amon; Amon of Josiah;
23156	40	1	11	 Josiah of Jeconiah and his brothers at the period of the Removal to Babylon.
23157	40	1	12	 After the Removal to Babylon Jeconiah had a son Shealtiel; Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel;
23158	40	1	13	 Zerubbabel of Abiud; Abiud of Eliakim; Eliakim of Azor;
23159	40	1	14	 Azor of Zadok; Zadok of Achim; Achim of Eliud;
23160	40	1	15	 Eliud of Eleazar; Eleazar of Matthan; Matthan of Jacob;
23161	40	1	16	 and Jacob of Joseph the husband of Mary, who was the mother of JESUS who is called CHRIST.
23162	40	1	17	 There are therefore, in all, fourteen generations from Abraham to David; fourteen from David to the Removal to Babylon; and fourteen from the Removal to Babylon to the Christ.
23163	40	1	18	 The circumstances of the birth  of Jesus Christ were these. After his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they were united in marriage, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
23164	40	1	19	 But Joseph her husband, being a  kind-hearted man and unwilling publicly to disgrace her, had determined to release her privately from the betrothal.
23165	40	1	20	 But while he  was contemplating this step, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to bring home your wife Mary, for she is with child through the Holy Spirit.
23166	40	1	21	 She will give birth to a Son, and you are to call His name  JESUS for He it is who will save His People from their sins."
23167	40	1	22	 All this  took place in  fulfilment of what the Lord had spoken through the Prophet,
23168	40	1	23	 <"Mark! The maiden will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call His name Immanuel"> --a word which signifies <`God with us'>.
23169	40	1	24	 When Joseph awoke, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded, and brought home his wife,
23170	40	1	25	 but did not live with her until she had given birth to  a son. The child's name he called JESUS.
23171	40	2	1	 Now after the birth of Jesus, which took place at Bethlehem in Judaea  in the reign of King Herod,  excitement was produced in Jerusalem by the arrival of certain  Magi from the east,
23172	40	2	2	 inquiring, "Where is the newly born king of the Jews? For we have seen his Star in the east, and have come here to do him homage."
23173	40	2	3	 Reports of this soon reached the king, and greatly agitated not only him but all the people of Jerusalem.
23174	40	2	4	 So he assembled all the  High Priests and Scribes of the people, and  anxiously asked them where the Christ was to be born.
23175	40	2	5	 "At Bethlehem in Judaea," they replied; "for so it stands written in the words of the Prophet,
23176	40	2	6	 <"`And thou,  Bethlehem in the land of Judah, by no means the least honorable art thou among  princely places in Judah! For from thee shall come a prince--one who shall be the Shepherd of My People Israel.'">
23177	40	2	7	 Thereupon Herod sent privately for the Magi and ascertained from them the exact time  of the star's appearing.
23178	40	2	8	 He then directed them to go to Bethlehem, adding, "Go and make careful inquiry about the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and  do him homage."
23179	40	2	9	 After hearing what the king said, they went to Bethlehem, while,  strange to say, the star  they had seen in the east led them on until it came and stood over the place where the babe was.
23180	40	2	10	 When they saw the star, the sight filled them with intense joy.
23181	40	2	11	 So they entered the house; and when they  saw the babe  with His mother Mary, they prostrated themselves and did Him homage, and opening their treasure-chests offered gifts to Him--gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
23182	40	2	12	 But being  forbidden by God in a dream to return to Herod, they went back to their own country by a different route.
23183	40	2	13	 When they were  gone, and angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Rise: take the babe and His mother and escape to Egypt, and remain there till I bring you word. For Herod is about to make search for the child in order to destroy Him."
23184	40	2	14	 So Joseph roused himself and took the babe and His mother by night and departed into Egypt.
23185	40	2	15	 There he remained till Herod's death, that what the Lord had said through the Prophet might be  fulfilled, <"Out of Egypt I called My Son.">
23186	40	2	16	 Then Herod, finding that the Magi had trifled with him, was furious, and sent and massacred all the boys under two years of age, in Bethlehem and all its neighbourhood, according to the date he had so carefully ascertained from the Magi.
23187	40	2	17	 Then were these words, spoken by the Prophet Jeremiah,  fulfilled,
23188	40	2	18	 <"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and bitter lamentation: It was Rachel  bewailing her children, and she refused to be comforted because there were no more.">
23189	40	2	19	 But after Herod's death an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said to him,
23190	40	2	20	 "Rise from sleep, and take the child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's life are dead."
23191	40	2	21	 So he roused himself and took the child and His mother and came into the land of Israel.
23192	40	2	22	 But hearing that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod on the throne of Judaea, he was afraid to go there; and being instructed  by God in a dream he withdrew into Galilee,
23193	40	2	23	 and went and settled in a town called Nazareth, in order that these words spoken through the Prophets might be fulfilled, <"He shall be called a  Nazarene.">
23194	40	3	1	  About this time John  the Baptist made his appearance, preaching in the Desert of Judaea.
23195	40	3	2	  "Repent," he said, "for the Kingdom of the Heavens is now close at hand."
23196	40	3	3	 He it is who was spoken of through the Prophet Isaiah when he said, <"The voice of one crying aloud,  `In the desert prepare ye a road for the Lord: make His highway straight.'">
23197	40	3	4	  This man John wore a garment of camel's hair, and a loincloth of leather; and he lived upon locusts and wild honey.
23198	40	3	5	 Then large numbers of people went out to him--people from Jerusalem and from all Judaea, and from the whole of the Jordan valley--
23199	40	3	6	 and were baptized by him in the Jordan, making full confession of their sins.
23200	40	3	7	 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he exclaimed, "O vipers'  brood, who has  warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
23201	40	3	8	 Therefore let your lives prove your  change of heart;
23202	40	3	9	 and  do not imagine that you can say  to yourselves, `We have Abraham as our forefather,' for I tell you that God can  raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones.
23203	40	3	10	 And already the axe is lying at the root of the trees, so that every tree which does not produce good fruit will quickly be hewn down and thrown into the fire.
23204	40	3	11	  I indeed am baptizing you  in water  on a profession of repentance; but He who is coming after me is mightier than I: His sandals I am not worthy to carry for a moment; He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire.
23205	40	3	12	 His winnowing-shovel is in His hand, and He will make a thorough clearance of His threshing-floor, gathering His wheat into the storehouse, but  burning up the  chaff in unquenchable fire."
23206	40	3	13	  Just at that time Jesus, coming from Galilee to the Jordan, presents Himself to John to be baptized by him.
23207	40	3	14	 John  protested. "It is I," he said, "who have need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"
23208	40	3	15	 "Let it be so on this occasion," Jesus replied; "for so we ought to fulfil every religious duty." Then he consented;
23209	40	3	16	 and Jesus was baptized, and immediately went up from the water.  At that moment the heavens  opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a  dove and alighting upon Him,
23210	40	3	17	 while a voice came from Heaven, saying, "This is My Son, the dearly loved, in whom is My delight."
23211	40	4	1	  At that time Jesus was  led up by the Spirit into the Desert in order to be tempted by the Devil.
23212	40	4	2	 There He fasted for forty days and nights; and after that He suffered from hunger.
23213	40	4	3	 So the Tempter came and said,  "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to turn into loaves."
23214	40	4	4	 "It is written," replied Jesus, <"`It is not on bread alone that a man shall live, but on whatsoever God shall appoint.'">
23215	40	4	5	 Then the Devil took Him to the Holy City and caused Him to stand on the roof of the  Temple,
23216	40	4	6	 and said,  "If you are God's Son, throw yourself down; for it is written, <"`To His angels He will give orders concerning thee, and on their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any moment thou shouldst strike thy foot against a stone.'">
23217	40	4	7	 "Again it is written," replied Jesus,  <"`Thou shalt not put the Lord thy God to the proof.'">
23218	40	4	8	 Then the Devil took Him to the top of an exceedingly lofty mountain, from which he caused Him to see all the Kingdoms of the world and their splendour,
23219	40	4	9	 and said to Him, "All this I will give you,  if you will kneel down and do me homage."
23220	40	4	10	 "Begone, Satan!" Jesus replied; "for it is written, <`To the Lord thy God thou shalt do homage, and to Him alone shalt thou render worship.'">
23221	40	4	11	 Thereupon the Devil left Him, and angels  at once came and ministered to Him.
23222	40	4	12	  Now when Jesus heard that John was  thrown into prison, He withdrew into Galilee,
23223	40	4	13	 and leaving Nazareth He went and settled at  Capernaum, a town by the  Lake on the frontiers of Zebulun and Naphtali,
23224	40	4	14	 in order that these words, spoken through the Prophet Isaiah, might be fulfilled,
23225	40	4	15	 <"Zebulun's land and Naphtali's land; the road by the  Lake; the country beyond the Jordan;  Galilee of the Nations!
23226	40	4	16	 The people who were  dwelling in darkness have seen a brilliant light; and on those who were dwelling in the  region of the shadow of death, on them light has dawned.">
23227	40	4	17	 From that time Jesus began to preach. "Repent," He said, "for the Kingdom of the Heavens is now close at hand."
23228	40	4	18	 And walking along the shore of the Lake of Galilee He saw two brothers--Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew--throwing a drag-net into the Lake; for they were fishers.
23229	40	4	19	 And He said to them, "Come and follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
23230	40	4	20	 So they immediately left their nets and followed Him. As He went further on,
23231	40	4	21	 He saw two other brothers, James the son of  Zabdi and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zabdi mending their nets; and He called them.
23232	40	4	22	 And they at once left the boat and their father, and followed Him.
23233	40	4	23	 Then Jesus  travelled through all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming  the Good News of the Kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and infirmity among the people.
23234	40	4	24	 Thus His fame spread through all Syria; and they brought all the sick to Him, the people who were  suffering from various diseases and pains--demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics; and He cured them.
23235	40	4	25	 And great crowds followed Him, coming from Galilee, from the Ten Towns, from Jerusalem, and from beyond the district on the other side of the Jordan.
23236	40	5	1	 Seeing the multitude of people, Jesus went up  the Hill. There He  seated Himself, and when His disciples came to Him,
23237	40	5	2	  He proceeded to teach them, and said:
23238	40	5	3	   "Blessed are the  poor in spirit, for to them belongs the Kingdom of the Heavens.
23239	40	5	4	  "Blessed are the mourners, for they shall be comforted.
23240	40	5	5	  "Blessed are  the meek, for they as heirs shall obtain possession of the earth.
23241	40	5	6	 "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be completely satisfied.
23242	40	5	7	 "Blessed are the compassionate, for they shall receive compassion.
23243	40	5	8	 "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
23244	40	5	9	 "Blessed are the peacemakers, for  it is they who will be recognized as sons of God.
23245	40	5	10	 "Blessed are those who have borne persecution in the cause of Righteousness, for to them belongs the Kingdom of the Heavens.
23246	40	5	11	  "Blessed are you when they have insulted and persecuted you, and have said every cruel thing about you falsely for my sake.
23247	40	5	12	 Be joyful and triumphant, because your reward is great in the Heavens; for so were the Prophets before you persecuted.
23248	40	5	13	  "*You* are the salt of the earth; but if salt has become  tasteless, in what way can it regain its saltness? It is no longer good for anything but to be thrown away and trodden on by the passers by.
23249	40	5	14	 *You* are the light of the world; a town cannot be hid if built on a hill-top.
23250	40	5	15	 Nor is a lamp lighted to be put under a bushel, but on the lampstand; and then it gives light to all in the house.
23251	40	5	16	 Just so let your light shine before all men, in order that they may see  your holy lives and may give glory to your Father who is in Heaven.
23252	40	5	17	 "Do not for a moment suppose that I have come to abrogate  the Law or the Prophets: I have not come to abrogate them but to give them their completion.
23253	40	5	18	  Solemnly I tell you that until  Heaven and earth pass away, not one iota or smallest detail will pass away from the Law until all has taken place.
23254	40	5	19	 Whoever therefore  breaks one of these least commandments and teaches  others to break them, will be called the least in the Kingdom of the Heavens; but whoever practises them and teaches them, he will be acknowledged as great in the Kingdom of the Heavens.
23255	40	5	20	 For I assure you that unless  your righteousness  greatly surpasses that of the Scribes and the Pharisees, you will certainly not find entrance into the Kingdom of the Heavens.
23256	40	5	21	  "You have heard that it was said to the ancients, <`Thou shalt not commit murder',> and whoever commits murder will be answerable to  the magistrate.
23257	40	5	22	 But I say to you that every one who becomes  angry with his brother shall be answerable to the magistrate; that whoever says to his brother  `Raca,' shall be answerable to the  Sanhedrin; and that whoever says, `You  fool!' shall be liable to the  Gehenna of Fire.
23258	40	5	23	 If therefore when you are offering your gift upon the altar, you remember that your brother has a grievance against you,
23259	40	5	24	 leave your gift there before the altar, and go and make friends with your brother first, and then return and proceed to offer your gift.
23260	40	5	25	  Come to terms without delay with your opponent while you are yet with him on the way to the court; for fear he should obtain judgement from the magistrate against you, and the magistrate should give you in custody to the officer and you be thrown into prison.
23261	40	5	26	 I solemnly tell you that you will certainly not be released till you have paid the very last farthing.
23262	40	5	27	 "You have heard that it was said, <`Thou shalt not commit adultery.'>
23263	40	5	28	 But I tell you that whoever looks at a woman and cherishes lustful thoughts has already in his heart become guilty with regard to her.
23264	40	5	29	 If therefore your eye, even the right eye,  is a snare to you, tear it out and away with it; it is better for you that one member should be destroyed rather than that your whole body should be thrown into Gehenna.
23265	40	5	30	 And if your right hand  is a snare to you, cut it off and away with it; it is better for you that one member should be destroyed rather than that your whole body should go into Gehenna.
23266	40	5	31	 "It was also said, <`If any man puts away his wife, let him give her a written notice of divorce.'>
23267	40	5	32	  But I tell you that every man who puts away his wife except on the ground of  unfaithfulness causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries  her when so divorced commits adultery.
23268	40	5	33	 "Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, <`Thou shalt not swear falsely, but shalt perform thy vows to the Lord.'>
23269	40	5	34	 But I tell you not to  swear at all; neither by Heaven, for it is God's throne;
23270	40	5	35	 nor by the earth, for it is the footstool under His feet; nor  by Jerusalem, for it is the City of the Great King.
23271	40	5	36	 And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.
23272	40	5	37	 But  let your language be, `Yes, yes,' or `No, no.' Anything in excess of this comes from the Evil one.
23273	40	5	38	 "You have heard that it was said, <`Eye for eye, tooth for tooth.'>
23274	40	5	39	  But I tell you not to resist a wicked man, but if any one  strikes you on the right  cheek, turn the other to him as well.
23275	40	5	40	 If any one wishes to go to law with you and to deprive you of your  under garment, let him take your outer one also.
23276	40	5	41	 And whoever shall compel you to  convey his goods one mile, go with him two.
23277	40	5	42	 To him who asks, give: from him who would borrow, turn not away.
23278	40	5	43	 "You have heard that it was said, <`Thou shalt love thy neighbour> and hate thine enemy.'
23279	40	5	44	  But I command you all, love your enemies, and pray for your persecutors;
23280	40	5	45	 that so you may become true sons of your Father in Heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the wicked as well as the good, and sends rain upon those who do right and those who do wrong.
23281	40	5	46	 For if you love only those who love you, what reward have you earned? Do not even the tax-gatherers do that?
23282	40	5	47	 And if you salute only your near relatives, what praise is due to you? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?
23283	40	5	48	 You however are to be complete in goodness, as your Heavenly Father is complete.
23284	40	6	1	 "But beware of doing your  good actions in the sight of men, in order to attract their gaze; if you do, there is no reward for you with your Father who is in Heaven.
23285	40	6	2	 `When you give in charity, never blow a  trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and streets in order that their praises may be sung by men. I solemnly tell you that  they already have their reward.
23286	40	6	3	 But when you are giving in  charity, let not your left hand perceive what your right hand is doing,
23287	40	6	4	 that your charities may be in secret; and then your Father--He who sees in secret--will recompense you.
23288	40	6	5	 "And when praying, you must not be like the hypocrites. They are fond of standing and praying in the synagogues or at the corners of the wider streets, in order that men may see them. I solemnly tell you that  they already have their reward.
23289	40	6	6	 But you, whenever you pray, go into your own room and shut the door: then pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father--He who sees in secret--will recompense you.
23290	40	6	7	 "And when praying, do not use needless repetitions as the Gentiles do, for they expect to be listened to because of their multitude of words.
23291	40	6	8	 Do not,  however, imitate them; for  your Father knows what things you need before ever you ask Him.
23292	40	6	9	  "In this manner therefore pray: `Our Father who art in Heaven, may Thy name be kept holy;
23293	40	6	10	 let Thy kingdom come; let Thy  will be done, as in Heaven so on earth;
23294	40	6	11	  give us to-day our bread  for the day;
23295	40	6	12	 and forgive us our shortcomings, as we also have forgiven those who have  failed in their duty towards us;
23296	40	6	13	 and bring us not into temptation, but rescue us  from the Evil one.'
23297	40	6	14	 "For if you forgive others their offences, your Heavenly Father will forgive you also;
23298	40	6	15	 but if you do not forgive others their offences, neither will your Father forgive yours.
23299	40	6	16	 "When any of you fast, never assume gloomy looks as the hypocrites do; for they disfigure their faces in order that it may be evident to men that they are fasting. I solemnly tell you that they already have their reward.
23300	40	6	17	 But, whenever you fast, pour  perfume on your hair and wash your face,
23301	40	6	18	 that it may not be apparent to men that you are fasting, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father--He who sees in secret--will recompense you.
23302	40	6	19	  "Do not lay up stores of wealth for yourselves on earth, where the moth and  wear-and-tear destroy, and where thieves  break in and steal.
23303	40	6	20	 But amass wealth for yourselves in Heaven, where neither the moth nor  wear-and-tear destroys, and where thieves do not  break in and steal.
23304	40	6	21	 For where your wealth is, there also will your heart be.
23305	40	6	22	  "The eye is the lamp of the body. If then your  eyesight is good, your whole body will be well lighted;
23306	40	6	23	 but if your  eyesight is bad, your whole body will be dark. If however the very light within you is darkness, how dense must the darkness be!
23307	40	6	24	  "No man can be the bondservant of two masters; for either he will dislike one and like the other, or he will attach himself to one and think slightingly of the other. You cannot be the bondservants both of God and of gold.
23308	40	6	25	  For this reason I charge you not to be over-anxious about your lives, inquiring what you are to eat or what you are to drink, nor yet about your bodies, inquiring what clothes you are to put on. Is not the life more precious than its food, and the body than its clothing?
23309	40	6	26	  Look at the birds which fly in the air: they do not sow or reap or store up in barns, but your Heavenly Father feeds them: are not you of much greater value than they?
23310	40	6	27	 Which of you by being over-anxious can add  a single foot to his height?
23311	40	6	28	 And why be anxious about clothing? Learn a lesson from the wild  lilies. Watch their growth. They neither  toil nor  spin,
23312	40	6	29	 and yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his magnificence could array himself like one of these.
23313	40	6	30	 And if God so clothes the wild herbage which to-day flourishes and to-morrow is thrown into the  oven, is it not much more certain that He will clothe you, you men of little faith?
23314	40	6	31	 Do not be  over-anxious, therefore, asking `What shall we eat?' or `What shall we drink?' or `What shall we wear?'
23315	40	6	32	 For all these are questions that Gentiles are always asking;  but your Heavenly Father knows that you need these things--all of them.
23316	40	6	33	 But make His Kingdom and righteousness your chief aim, and then these things shall all be given you in addition.
23317	40	6	34	 Do not be  over-anxious, therefore, about to-morrow, for to-morrow will bring its own cares. Enough for each day are its own troubles.
23318	40	7	1	  "Judge not, that you may not be judged;
23319	40	7	2	 for your own judgement will be dealt--and your own measure meted--to yourselves.
23320	40	7	3	  And why do you look at the splinter in your brother's eye, and not notice the beam which is in your own eye?
23321	40	7	4	 Or how say to your brother, `Allow me to take the splinter out of your eye,' while the beam is in your own eye?
23322	40	7	5	 Hypocrite, first take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly how to remove the splinter from your brother's eye.
23323	40	7	6	 "Give not that which is holy to the dogs, nor throw your pearls to the swine; otherwise they will trample them under their feet and then turn and  attack you.
23324	40	7	7	  "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.
23325	40	7	8	 For it is always he who asks that receives, he who seeks that finds, and he who knocks that has the door opened to him.
23326	40	7	9	 What man is there among you, who if his son shall ask him for bread will offer him a stone?
23327	40	7	10	 Or if the son shall ask him for a fish will offer him a snake?
23328	40	7	11	 If you then, imperfect as you are, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in Heaven give good things to those who ask Him!
23329	40	7	12	  Everything, therefore, be it what it may, that you would have men do to you, do you also the same to them; for in this the Law and the Prophets are summed up.
23330	40	7	13	  "Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the  gate and broad the road which leads to ruin, and many there are who enter by it;
23331	40	7	14	  because narrow is the gate and contracted the road which leads  to Life, and few are those who find it.
23332	40	7	15	 "Beware of the false  teachers--men who come to you in sheep's fleeces, but beneath that disguise they are ravenous wolves.
23333	40	7	16	  By their fruits you will easily recognize them. Are grapes gathered from  thorns or figs from  brambles?
23334	40	7	17	 Just so every good tree produces good fruit, but a poisonous tree produces bad fruit.
23335	40	7	18	 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor a poisonous tree good fruit.
23336	40	7	19	 Every tree which does not yield good fruit is cut down and thrown aside for burning.
23337	40	7	20	 So by their fruits at any rate, you will easily recognize them.
23338	40	7	21	 "Not every one who says to me, `Master, Master,'  will enter the Kingdom of the Heavens, but only those who are obedient to my Father who is in Heaven.
23339	40	7	22	  Many will say to me on that day, "`Master, Master, have we not prophesied in Thy name, and in Thy name expelled demons, and in Thy name performed many mighty works?'
23340	40	7	23	 "And then I will tell them plainly, "`I never knew you: begone from me, you doers of  wickedness.'
23341	40	7	24	  "Every one who hears  these my teachings and acts upon them  will be found to resemble a wise man who builds his house upon rock;
23342	40	7	25	 and the heavy rain falls, the swollen torrents come, and the winds blow and beat against the house; yet it does not fall, for its foundation is on rock.
23343	40	7	26	 And every one who hears these my teachings and does not act upon them will be found to resemble a fool who builds his house upon sand.
23344	40	7	27	 The heavy rain descends, the swollen torrents come, and the winds blow and burst upon the house, and it falls; and disastrous is the fall."
23345	40	7	28	 When Jesus had concluded this discourse, the crowds were  filled with amazement at His teaching,
23346	40	7	29	 for He had been teaching them as one who had authority, and not as their Scribes taught.
23347	40	8	1	  Upon descending from the hill country He was followed by immense crowds.
23348	40	8	2	 And a leper came to Him, and throwing himself at His feet, said,  "Sir, if only you are willing you are able to cleanse me."
23349	40	8	3	 So Jesus put out His hand and touched him, and said, "I am willing: be cleansed." Instantly he was cleansed from his leprosy;
23350	40	8	4	 and Jesus said to him, "Be careful to tell no one, but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses appointed as evidence for them."
23351	40	8	5	  After His entry into Capernaum a  Captain came to Him, and entreated Him.
23352	40	8	6	 "Sir," he said, "my  servant at home is lying ill with paralysis, and is suffering great  pain."
23353	40	8	7	 "I will come and cure him," said Jesus.
23354	40	8	8	 "Sir," replied the Captain, "I am not  a fit person to receive you under my roof: merely say  the word, and my servant will be cured.
23355	40	8	9	 For I myself am also  under authority, and have soldiers under me. To one I say `Go,' and he goes, to another `Come,' and he comes, and to my slave `Do this or that,' and he does it."
23356	40	8	10	 Jesus listened to this reply, and was astonished, and said to the people following Him, "I solemnly tell you that  in no Israelite have I found faith as great as this.
23357	40	8	11	 And I tell you that many will come from the east and from the west and will  recline at table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of the Heavens,
23358	40	8	12	 while the natural heirs of the Kingdom will be driven out into the darkness outside: there will be  the weeping aloud and the gnashing of teeth."
23359	40	8	13	 And Jesus said to the Captain, "Go, and just as you have believed, so be it for you." And the servant recovered precisely at that time.
23360	40	8	14	  After this Jesus went to the house of Peter, whose mother-in-law he  found ill in bed with fever.
23361	40	8	15	 He touched her hand and the fever left her: and then she  rose and  waited upon Him.
23362	40	8	16	  In the evening many demoniacs were brought to Him, and with a word He expelled the demons; and He cured all the sick,
23363	40	8	17	 in order that this prediction of the Prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, <"He took on Him our weaknesses, and bore the burden of our diseases.">
23364	40	8	18	  Seeing  great crowds about Him Jesus had given directions to cross to the other side of the Lake,
23365	40	8	19	  when  a Scribe came and said to Him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
23366	40	8	20	 "Foxes have holes," replied Jesus, "and birds have  nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."
23367	40	8	21	 Another of the disciples said to Him, "Sir, allow me first to go and bury my father."
23368	40	8	22	 "Follow me," said Jesus, "and leave the  dead to bury their own dead."
23369	40	8	23	  Then He went on board a fishing-boat, and His disciples followed Him.
23370	40	8	24	 But  suddenly there arose a great storm on the Lake, so that the waves threatened to engulf the boat; but He was asleep.
23371	40	8	25	 So they came and woke Him, crying, "Master, save us, we are drowning!"
23372	40	8	26	 "Why are you so easily frightened," He replied, "you men of little faith?" Then He rose and reproved the winds and the waves, and there was a perfect calm;
23373	40	8	27	 and the men, filled with amazement, exclaimed, "What kind of man is this? for the very winds and waves obey him!"
23374	40	8	28	  On His arrival at the other side, in the country of the Gadarenes, there met Him two men possessed by demons, coming  from among the tombs: they were so dangerously fierce that no one was able to pass that way.
23375	40	8	29	 They cried aloud, "What hast Thou to do with us, Thou Son of God? Hast Thou come here to torment us before the time?"
23376	40	8	30	 Now at some distance from them a vast herd of swine were feeding.
23377	40	8	31	 So the demons entreated Him. "If Thou drivest us out," they said, "send us into the herd of swine."
23378	40	8	32	 "Go," He replied. Then they came out from the men and went into the swine, whereupon the entire herd  instantly rushed down the cliff into the Lake and perished in the water.
23379	40	8	33	 The  swineherds fled, and went and told the whole story in the town, including what had happened to the demoniacs.
23380	40	8	34	 So at once the whole population came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they besought Him to leave their country.
23381	40	9	1	  Accordingly He went on board, and crossing over came to  His own town.
23382	40	9	2	 Here they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a  bed. Seeing their faith Jesus said to the paralytic, "Take courage, my child; your sins are pardoned."
23383	40	9	3	 "Such language is impious," said some of the Scribes  among themselves.
23384	40	9	4	  Knowing their thoughts Jesus said, "Why are you cherishing evil thoughts in your hearts?
23385	40	9	5	 Why, which is easier? --to say, `Your sins are pardoned,' or to say `Rise up and walk'?
23386	40	9	6	 But, to prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to pardon sins" --He then says to the paralytic, "Rise, and take up your bed and go home."
23387	40	9	7	 And he got up, and went off home.
23388	40	9	8	 And the crowds were awe-struck when they saw it, and ascribed the glory to God who had  entrusted such power  to a man.
23389	40	9	9	  Passing on thence Jesus saw a man called Matthew  sitting at the Toll Office, and said to him,  "Follow me." And he arose, and followed Him.
23390	40	9	10	 And while He was reclining  at table, a large number of  tax-gathers and notorious sinners were of the party with Jesus and His disciples.
23391	40	9	11	 The Pharisees noticed this, and they inquired of His disciples, "Why does your Teacher eat with the tax-gatherers and notorious sinners?"
23392	40	9	12	 He heard the question and replied, "It is not men in good health who require a doctor, but the sick.
23393	40	9	13	 But  go and learn what this means, <`It is mercy that I desire, not sacrifice';> for I did not come to appeal to the righteous, but to sinners."
23394	40	9	14	  At that time John's disciples came and asked Jesus, "Why do we and the Pharisees  fast, but your disciples do not?"
23395	40	9	15	 "Can the bridegroom's party mourn," He replied, "as long as the bridegroom is with them? But other days will come (when the Bridegroom has been taken from them) and then they will fast.
23396	40	9	16	 No one ever mends an old cloak with a patch of newly woven cloth. Otherwise, the patch put on would tear away some of the old, and a worse hole would be made.
23397	40	9	17	 Nor do people pour new wine into old  wineskins. Otherwise, the skins would split, the wine  would escape, and the skins be destroyed. But they put new wine into fresh skins, and both are saved."
23398	40	9	18	  While He was thus speaking, a  Ruler came up and  profoundly bowing said, "My daughter is just dead; but come and put your hand upon her and she will return to life."
23399	40	9	19	 And Jesus rose and followed him, as did also His disciples.
23400	40	9	20	 But a woman who for twelve years had been afflicted with haemorrhage came behind Him and  touched the  tassel of His cloak;
23401	40	9	21	 for she said to herself, "If I but touch His cloak, I shall be cured."
23402	40	9	22	 And Jesus turned and saw her, and said, "Take courage, daughter; your faith has  cured you." And the woman was restored to health from that moment.
23403	40	9	23	 Entering the Ruler's house, Jesus saw the flute-players and the  crowd loudly wailing,
23404	40	9	24	 and He said, "Go out of the room; the little girl is not dead, but asleep." And they laughed at Him.
23405	40	9	25	 When however the place was cleared of the crowd, Jesus went in, and on His taking the little girl by the hand, she  rose up.
23406	40	9	26	 And the report of this spread throughout all that district.
23407	40	9	27	 As Jesus passed on, two blind men followed Him, shouting and saying, "Pity us, Son of David."
23408	40	9	28	 And when He had gone indoors, they came to Him. "Do you believe that I can do this?" He asked them. "Yes,  Sir," they replied.
23409	40	9	29	 So He touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith let it be to you."
23410	40	9	30	 Then their eyes were opened. And assuming a stern tone Jesus said to them, "Be careful to let no one know."
23411	40	9	31	 But they went out and published His fame in all that district.
23412	40	9	32	  And as they were leaving His presence a  dumb demoniac was brought to Him.
23413	40	9	33	 When the demon was expelled, the dumb man could speak. And the crowds exclaimed in astonishment, "Never was such a thing seen in Israel."
23414	40	9	34	 But the Pharisees maintained, "It is  by the power of the Prince of the demons that he drives out the demons."
23415	40	9	35	  And Jesus continued His circuits through all the towns and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and infirmity.
23416	40	9	36	 And when He saw the crowds He was touched with pity for them, because they were distressed and were fainting on the ground like sheep which have no shepherd.
23417	40	9	37	 Then He said to His disciples, "The harvest is abundant, but the reapers are few;
23418	40	9	38	 therefore entreat the Owner of the Harvest to send out reapers into His  fields."
23419	40	10	1	  Then He called to Him His twelve disciples and gave them authority over foul spirits, to drive them out; and to cure every kind of disease and infirmity.
23420	40	10	2	 Now the names of the twelve  Apostles were these: first, Simon called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zabdi, and his brother John;
23421	40	10	3	 Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax-gatherer, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
23422	40	10	4	 Simon the  Cananaean, and Judas the  Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.
23423	40	10	5	  These twelve Jesus  sent on a mission, after giving them their instructions: "Go not," He said, "among the Gentiles, and enter no Samaritan town;
23424	40	10	6	 but, instead of that, go to the  lost sheep of Israel's race.
23425	40	10	7	 And as you go, preach and say, `The Kingdom of the Heavens is close at hand.'
23426	40	10	8	 Cure the sick,  raise the dead to life, cleanse lepers, drive out demons: you have received without payment, give without payment.
23427	40	10	9	 "Provide no gold, nor even silver nor copper to carry in your pockets;
23428	40	10	10	 no bag for your journey, nor change of linen, nor shoes, nor stick; for the labourer deserves his food.
23429	40	10	11	 "Whatever town or village you enter, inquire for some good man; and make his house your home till you leave the place.
23430	40	10	12	 When you enter the house,  salute it;
23431	40	10	13	 and if the house deserves it, the peace you invoke shall come upon it. If not, your peace shall return to you.
23432	40	10	14	 And whoever refuses to receive you or even to listen to your Message, as you leave that house or town,  shake off the very dust  from your feet.
23433	40	10	15	 I solemnly tell you that it will be more endurable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of Judgement than for that town.
23434	40	10	16	  "Remember it is I who am sending you out, as sheep into the midst of wolves; prove yourselves as sagacious as serpents, and as innocent as  doves.
23435	40	10	17	  But beware of men; for they will deliver you up to appear before  Sanhedrins, and will flog you in their synagogues;
23436	40	10	18	 and you will even be put on trial before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness to them and to the Gentiles.
23437	40	10	19	 But when they have delivered you up, have  no anxiety as to how you shall speak or what you shall say; for at that very time it shall be given you what to say;
23438	40	10	20	 for it is not you who will speak: it will be the Spirit of your Father speaking  through you.
23439	40	10	21	 Brother will betray brother to death, and father, child; and children will rise against their own parents and will put them to death.
23440	40	10	22	 And you will be objects of universal hatred because you are called by my name; but he who holds out to  the End--he will be saved.
23441	40	10	23	  Whenever they persecute you in one town,  escape to the next; for I solemnly tell you that you will not have gone the round of all the towns of Israel  before the Son of Man comes.
23442	40	10	24	 "The  learner is never superior to his teacher, and the  servant is never superior to his  master.
23443	40	10	25	 Enough for the learner to be on a level with his teacher, and for the servant to be on a level with his master. If they have called the master of the house  Baal-zebul, how much more will they slander his servants?
23444	40	10	26	  Fear them not, however; there is nothing veiled which will not be uncovered, nor secret which will not become known.
23445	40	10	27	 What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what is whispered into your ear, proclaim upon the roofs of the houses.
23446	40	10	28	 "And do not fear those who kill the body, but cannot kill the  soul; but rather  fear him who is able to destroy both  soul and body in Gehenna.
23447	40	10	29	 Do not two sparrows sell for a  halfpenny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father's leave.
23448	40	10	30	 But as for you, the very hairs on your heads are all numbered.
23449	40	10	31	 Away then with fear; you are more  precious than a multitude of sparrows.
23450	40	10	32	 "Every man who  acknowledges me before men I also  will acknowledge before my Father who is in Heaven.
23451	40	10	33	 But whoever disowns me before men I also will disown before my Father who is in Heaven.
23452	40	10	34	  "Do not suppose that I came to  bring peace to the earth: I did not come to bring peace but a sword.
23453	40	10	35	 For I came to set a man against his father, <a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;
23454	40	10	36	 and a man's own family will be his foes.>
23455	40	10	37	  Any one who loves father or mother more than me  is not worthy of me, and any one who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;
23456	40	10	38	 and any one who does not take up his  cross and follow where I lead is not worthy of me.
23457	40	10	39	 To save your  life is to lose it, and to lose your life for my sake is to save it.
23458	40	10	40	  "Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives Him who sent me.
23459	40	10	41	 Every one who receives a  prophet, because he is a prophet, will receive a prophet's reward, and every one who receives a righteous man, because he is a righteous man, will receive a righteous man's reward.
23460	40	10	42	  And whoever gives one of these  little ones  even a cup of cold water to drink because he is a disciple, I solemnly tell you that he will not lose his reward."
23461	40	11	1	 When Jesus had concluded His instructions to His twelve disciples, He left in order to teach and to  proclaim His Message in the neighbouring towns.
23462	40	11	2	  Now John had heard in prison about the Christ's doings, and he sent  some of his disciples to inquire:
23463	40	11	3	 "Are you the Coming One, or is it a different person that we are to expect?"
23464	40	11	4	 "Go and report to John what you see and hear," replied Jesus;
23465	40	11	5	 "blind eyes  receive sight, and cripples walk; lepers are cleansed, and deaf ears hear; the dead  are raised to life, and the poor have the Good News proclaimed to them;
23466	40	11	6	 and blessed is every one who does not stumble and fall because of my claims."
23467	40	11	7	  When the messengers had taken their leave, Jesus proceeded to say to the multitude concerning John, "What did you go out into the Desert to gaze at? A reed waving in the wind?
23468	40	11	8	 But what did you go out to see? A man luxuriously dressed? Those who wear luxurious clothes are to be found in kings' palaces.
23469	40	11	9	 But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet.
23470	40	11	10	 This is he of whom it is written, <"`See I am sending My  messenger before Thy face, and he will make Thy road ready before Thee.'>
23471	40	11	11	 "I solemnly tell you that among all of woman born no greater has ever been raised up than John the Baptist; yet one who is of lower rank in the Kingdom of the Heavens is greater than he.
23472	40	11	12	  But from  the time of John the Baptist till now, the Kingdom of the Heavens  has been suffering violent assault, and the violent have been seizing it by force.
23473	40	11	13	 For all the Prophets and the Law  taught until John.
23474	40	11	14	 And (if you are willing to receive it) he is the Elijah who  was to come.
23475	40	11	15	 Listen, every one who has  ears!
23476	40	11	16	 "But to what shall I compare the present generation? It is like children sitting in the open places, who call  to their playmates.
23477	40	11	17	 "`We have played the flute to you,' they say, `and you have not danced: we have sung dirges, and you have not beaten your breasts.'
23478	40	11	18	 "For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, `He has a demon.'
23479	40	11	19	 The Son of Man came  eating and drinking, and they exclaim, `See this man! --given to gluttony and tippling, and a friend of tax-gatherers and notorious sinners!' And yet Wisdom  is vindicated by her  actions."
23480	40	11	20	  Then began He to upbraid the towns where most of His mighty works had been done--because they had not repented.
23481	40	11	21	  "Alas for  thee, Chorazin!" He cried. "Alas for thee,  Bethsaida! For had the mighty works been done in Tyre and Sidon which have been done in  both of you, they would long ere now have repented, covered with sackcloth and ashes.
23482	40	11	22	 Only I tell you that it will be more endurable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of Judgement than for you.
23483	40	11	23	 And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted even to Heaven? Even to  Hades shalt thou  descend. For had the mighty works been done in Sodom which have been done in thee, it would have remained until now.
23484	40	11	24	 Only I tell  you all, that it will be more endurable for the land of Sodom on the day of Judgement than for thee."
23485	40	11	25	  About that time  Jesus exclaimed, "I heartily praise Thee, Father,  Lord of Heaven and of earth, that Thou hast hidden these things from sages and men of discernment, and hast unveiled them to babes.
23486	40	11	26	 Yes, Father, for such has been Thy gracious will.
23487	40	11	27	 "All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father, nor does any one fully know the Father except the Son and all to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.
23488	40	11	28	 "Come to me, all you toiling and burdened ones, and *I* will give you rest.
23489	40	11	29	 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me; for I am  gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
23490	40	11	30	 For  it is good to bear my yoke, and my burden is light."
23491	40	12	1	  About that time Jesus passed on the Sabbath through the wheatfields; and His disciples  became hungry, and began to gather ears of wheat and eat them.
23492	40	12	2	 But the Pharisees saw it and said to Him, "Look! your disciples are doing what the Law forbids them to do on the Sabbath."
23493	40	12	3	 "Have you never read," He replied, "what David did when he and his men were hungry?
23494	40	12	4	 how he entered the House of God  and ate the Presented Loaves, which it was not lawful for him or his men to eat,  nor for any except the priests?
23495	40	12	5	 And have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the Temple  break the Sabbath without incurring guilt?
23496	40	12	6	 But I tell you that there is here  that which is greater than the Temple.
23497	40	12	7	 And if you knew what this means, <`It is mercy I desire, not sacrifice'>, you would not have condemned those who are without guilt.
23498	40	12	8	  For the Son of Man is the Lord of the Sabbath."
23499	40	12	9	  Departing thence  He went to their synagogue,
23500	40	12	10	 where there was a man with a shrivelled  arm. And they questioned Him,  "Is it right to cure people on the Sabbath?" Their intention was to bring a charge against Him.
23501	40	12	11	 "Which of you is there," He replied, "who, if he has but a single sheep and it falls into a hole on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out?
23502	40	12	12	 Is not a man, however, far superior to a sheep? Therefore it is right to do good on the Sabbath."
23503	40	12	13	 Then He said to the man, "Stretch out your arm." And he stretched it out, and it was restored quite sound like the other.
23504	40	12	14	 But the Pharisees after leaving the synagogue consulted together against Him, how they might destroy Him.
23505	40	12	15	 Aware of this, Jesus departed elsewhere; and a great number of people followed Him, all of whom He cured.
23506	40	12	16	 But He gave them strict injunctions not to blaze abroad His doings,
23507	40	12	17	 that those words of the Prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled,
23508	40	12	18	  <"This is My servant whom I have chosen, My dearly loved One in whom My soul  takes pleasure. I will put My spirit upon Him, and He will announce justice to the nations.
23509	40	12	19	 He will not wrangle or raise His voice, nor will His voice be heard in the broadways.
23510	40	12	20	  A crushed reed He will not utterly break, nor will He quench the still smouldering wick, until He has led on Justice to victory.
23511	40	12	21	 And on His name shall the nations  rest their hopes.">
23512	40	12	22	  At that time a demoniac was brought to Him, blind and  dumb; and He cured him, so that the dumb man could speak and see.
23513	40	12	23	 And the crowds of people were all filled with amazement and said, "Can this be  the Son of David?"
23514	40	12	24	 The Pharisees heard it and said, "This man only expels demons by the power of Baal-zebul, the Prince of demons."
23515	40	12	25	 Knowing their thoughts He said to them, "Every kingdom in which civil war has raged suffers desolation; and every city or house in which there is internal strife will be brought low.
23516	40	12	26	 And if Satan is expelling Satan, he has  begun to make war on himself: how therefore shall his kingdom last?
23517	40	12	27	 And if it is by Baal-zebul's power that I expel the demons, by whose power do your  disciples expel them? They therefore shall be your judges.
23518	40	12	28	 But if it is by the power of the Spirit of God that I expel the demons, it is evident that the  Kingdom of God  has come upon you.
23519	40	12	29	 Again, how can any one enter the house of  a strong man and carry off his goods, unless first of all he masters and secures the strong man: then he will ransack his house.
23520	40	12	30	 "The man who is not with me is against me, and he who is not gathering with me is scattering abroad.
23521	40	12	31	 This is why I tell you that  men may find forgiveness for every other sin and impious word, but that for impious speaking against the Holy Spirit they shall find no forgiveness.
23522	40	12	32	 And whoever  shall speak against the Son of Man may obtain forgiveness; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, neither in this nor in the coming age shall he obtain forgiveness."
23523	40	12	33	 "Either grant the tree to be wholesome and its fruit wholesome, or the tree poisonous and its fruit poisonous; for the tree is known by its fruit.
23524	40	12	34	 O vipers'  brood, how can you speak what is good when you are evil? For it is from the overflow of the heart that the mouth speaks.
23525	40	12	35	 A good man from his good store produces good things, and a bad man from his bad store produces bad things.
23526	40	12	36	 But I tell you that for every careless word that men shall speak they will be held accountable on the day of Judgement.
23527	40	12	37	 For each of you by his words shall be justified, or by his words shall be condemned."
23528	40	12	38	  Then He was accosted by some of the Scribes and of the Pharisees who said, "Teacher, we wish to see a sign  given by you."
23529	40	12	39	 "Wicked and faithless generation!" He replied, "they clamour for a sign, but none shall be given to them except the sign of the Prophet Jonah.
23530	40	12	40	 For just as <Jonah was  three days in the sea-monster's belly,> so will the Son of Man be three days in the heart of the earth.
23531	40	12	41	 There will stand up men of Nineveh at the Judgement together with the present generation, and will condemn it; because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and mark! there is  One greater than Jonah here.
23532	40	12	42	 The Queen of the south will awake at the Judgement together with the present generation, and will condemn it; because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and mark! there is One greater than Solomon here.
23533	40	12	43	  "No sooner however has  the foul spirit gone out of the man, then he  roams about in places where there is no water, seeking rest but finding none.
23534	40	12	44	 Then he says, `I will return to my house that I left;' and he comes and finds it unoccupied, swept clean, and  in good order.
23535	40	12	45	 Then he goes and brings back with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they come in and dwell there; and in the end that man's condition becomes worse than it was at first. So will it be also with  the present wicked generation."
23536	40	12	46	  While He was still addressing the people His mother and His brothers were standing on the edge of the crowd desiring to speak to Him.
23537	40	12	47	  So some one told Him, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, and desire to speak to you."
23538	40	12	48	 "Who is my mother?" He said to the man; "and who are my brothers?"
23539	40	12	49	 And pointing to His disciples He added, "See here are my mother and my brothers.
23540	40	12	50	 To obey my Father who is in Heaven--that is to be my brother and my sister and my mother."
23541	40	13	1	  That same day Jesus had left the house and was sitting on the shore of the Lake,
23542	40	13	2	 when a vast multitude of people crowded round Him. He therefore went on board a boat and sat there, while all the people stood on the shore.
23543	40	13	3	  He then spoke many things to them in  figurative language. "The sower  goes out," He said, "to sow.
23544	40	13	4	 As he sows, some of the seed falls by the way-side, and the birds come and peck it up.
23545	40	13	5	 Some falls on rocky ground, where it has but scanty soil. It quickly shows itself above ground, because it has no depth of earth;
23546	40	13	6	 but when the sun is risen, it is scorched by the heat, and through having no root it withers up.
23547	40	13	7	 Some falls  among the thorns; but the thorns spring up and stifle it.
23548	40	13	8	 But a portion falls upon good ground, and  gives a return, some a hundred for one, some sixty, some thirty.
23549	40	13	9	 Listen, every one who has ears!"
23550	40	13	10	  (And His disciples  came and asked Him, "Why do you speak to them in figurative language?"
23551	40	13	11	 "Because," He replied, "while to you it is granted to know the secrets of the Kingdom of the Heavens, to them it is not.
23552	40	13	12	 For whoever has, to him more shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but whoever has not, from him even what he has shall be taken away.
23553	40	13	13	 I speak to them in figurative language for this reason, that while looking they do not see, and while hearing they neither hear nor understand.
23554	40	13	14	 And in regard to them the prophecy of Isaiah is receiving signal fulfilment: <"`You will hear and hear and by no means understand, and you will look and look and by no means see.
23555	40	13	15	 For this people's  mind  is stupefied, their hearing has become dull, and their eyes they have closed; to prevent their ever seeing with their eyes, or hearing with their ears, or understanding with their minds, and turning back,  so that I might heal them.'>
23556	40	13	16	 "But as for you, blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.
23557	40	13	17	 For I solemnly tell you that many Prophets and holy men have longed to see the sights you see, and have not seen them, and to hear the words you hear, and have not heard them.
23558	40	13	18	  "To you then I will explain the parable of the Sower.
23559	40	13	19	 When a man hears the Message concerning the Kingdom and does not understand it, the Evil one comes and catches away what has been sown in his heart. This is he who  has received the seed by the road-side.
23560	40	13	20	 He who  has received the seed on the rocky ground is the man who hears the Message and immediately receives it with joy.
23561	40	13	21	 It has struck no root, however, within him. He continues for a time, but when suffering comes, or persecution, because of the Message, he at once stumbles and falls.
23562	40	13	22	 He who  has received the seed among the thorns is the man who hears the Message, but the cares of the present age and the delusions of riches quite stifle the Message, and it becomes unfruitful.
23563	40	13	23	 But he who  has received the seed on good ground is he who hears and understands. Such hearers give a return, and yield one a hundred for one, another sixty, another thirty.")
23564	40	13	24	  Another parable He put before them. "The Kingdom of the Heavens," He said,  "may be compared to a man who has sown good seed in his field,
23565	40	13	25	 but  during the night his enemy comes, and over the first seed he sows darnel among the wheat, and goes away.
23566	40	13	26	 But when the blade shoots up and the grain is formed, then appears the darnel also.
23567	40	13	27	 "So the farmer's  men come and ask him, "`Sir, was it not good seed that you sowed on your land? Where then does the darnel come from?'
23568	40	13	28	 "`Some enemy has done this,' he said. "`Shall we go, and collect it?' the  men inquire.
23569	40	13	29	 "`No,' he replied, `for fear that while collecting the darnel you should at the same time root up the wheat with it.
23570	40	13	30	 Leave both to grow together until the harvest, and at harvest-time I will direct the reapers, Collect the darnel  first, and make it up into bundles to burn it, but  bring  all the wheat into my barn.'"
23571	40	13	31	  Another parable He put before them. "The Kingdom of the Heavens," He said, "is like a mustard-seed, which a man takes and sows in his ground.
23572	40	13	32	 It is  the smallest of all seeds, and yet when full-grown it is larger than any  herb and forms a tree, so that the birds come and build in its branches."
23573	40	13	33	 Another parable He spoke to them. "The Kingdom of the Heavens," He said, "is like  yeast which a woman takes and buries in a bushel of flour, for it to work there till the whole mass has risen."
23574	40	13	34	  All this Jesus spoke to the people in figurative language, and except in figurative language He spoke nothing to them,
23575	40	13	35	 in fulfilment of the saying of  the Prophet, <"I will open my mouth in figurative language, I will utter things kept hidden since the creation of all things.">
23576	40	13	36	 When He had dismissed the people and had returned to the house, His disciples came to Him with the request, "Explain to us the parable of the darnel sown in the field."
23577	40	13	37	 "The sower of the good seed," He replied, "is the Son of Man;
23578	40	13	38	 the field is the world; the good seed--these are the  sons of the Kingdom; the darnel, the sons of the Evil one.
23579	40	13	39	 The enemy who sows the darnel is *the Devil*; the harvest is the  Close of the Age; the reapers are the angels.
23580	40	13	40	 As then the darnel is collected together and burnt up with fire, so will it be at the Close of the Age.
23581	40	13	41	 The Son of Man will commission His angels, and they will gather out of His Kingdom all  causes of sin and all who violate His laws;
23582	40	13	42	 and these they will throw into the fiery furnace. There will be  the weeping aloud and the gnashing of teeth.
23583	40	13	43	 Then will the righteous shine out  like the sun in  their Father's Kingdom. Listen, every one who has ears!
23584	40	13	44	 "The Kingdom of the Heavens is like treasure buried in the open country, which a man finds, but buries again, and, in his joy about it, goes and sells all he has and buys that piece of ground.
23585	40	13	45	 "Again the Kingdom of the Heavens is like  a jewel merchant who is in quest of choice pearls.
23586	40	13	46	 He finds one most costly pearl; he goes away; and though it costs all he has, he buys it.
23587	40	13	47	 "Again the Kingdom of the Heavens is like a draw-net let down into the sea, which encloses fish of all sorts.
23588	40	13	48	 When full, they haul it up on the beach, and sit down and collect the good fish in baskets, while  the worthless they throw away.
23589	40	13	49	 So will it be at the  Close of the Age. The angels will go forth and separate the wicked from among the righteous,
23590	40	13	50	 and will throw them into the fiery furnace. There will be the weeping aloud and the gnashing of teeth."
23591	40	13	51	 "Have you understood all this?" He asked. "Yes," they said.
23592	40	13	52	  "Therefore," He said, "remember that every Scribe well trained for the Kingdom of the Heavens is like a householder who brings out of his storehouse new things and old."
23593	40	13	53	 Jesus concluded this series of parables and then departed.
23594	40	13	54	  And He came into His own  country and proceeded to teach in their synagogue, so that they were filled with astonishment and exclaimed, "Where did he obtain such wisdom, and these wondrous powers?
23595	40	13	55	 Is not  this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers, James, Joseph, Simon and Judah?
23596	40	13	56	 And his sisters--are they not all living here among us? Where then did he get all this?"
23597	40	13	57	 So they  turned angrily away from Him. But Jesus said to them, "There is no prophet left without honour except in his own country and among his own  family."
23598	40	13	58	 And He performed but few mighty deeds there because of their want of faith.
23599	40	14	1	  About that time Herod the Tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,
23600	40	14	2	 and he said to his courtiers, "This is John the Baptist: he has come back to life--and that is why these miraculous Powers are working in him."
23601	40	14	3	  For Herod had arrested John, and had put him in chains, and imprisoned him, for the sake of Herodias his brother Philip's wife,
23602	40	14	4	 because John had persistently said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
23603	40	14	5	 And he would have liked to put him to death, but was afraid of the people, because they regarded John as a Prophet.
23604	40	14	6	  But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before all the company, and so pleased Herod
23605	40	14	7	 that with an oath he promised to give her whatever she asked.
23606	40	14	8	 So she, instigated by her mother, said, "Give me here on a dish the head of John the Baptist."
23607	40	14	9	 The king was deeply vexed, yet because of his repeated oath and of the guests at his table he ordered it to be given her,
23608	40	14	10	 and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.
23609	40	14	11	 The head was brought on a dish and given to the young girl, and she took it to her mother.
23610	40	14	12	 Then John's disciples went and removed the body and buried  it, and came and informed Jesus.
23611	40	14	13	  Upon receiving these tidings, Jesus went away by boat to an uninhabited and secluded district; but the people heard of it and followed Him in crowds from the towns by land.
23612	40	14	14	 So Jesus  went out and saw an immense multitude, and felt compassion for them, and cured those of them who were out of health.
23613	40	14	15	 But when  evening was come, the disciples came to Him and said, "This is an uninhabited place, and the best of the day is now gone; send the people away to go into the villages and buy something to eat."
23614	40	14	16	 "They need not go away," replied Jesus; "you yourselves must give them something to eat."
23615	40	14	17	 "We have nothing here," they said, "but five loaves and a couple of fish."
23616	40	14	18	 "Bring them here to me," He said,
23617	40	14	19	 and He told all the people to sit down on the grass. Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and after looking up to heaven and blessing them, He broke up the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples distributed them to the people.
23618	40	14	20	 So all ate, and were fully satisfied. The  broken portions that remained over they gathered up, filling twelve baskets.
23619	40	14	21	 Those who had eaten were about 5,000 adult men, without reckoning women and children.
23620	40	14	22	  Immediately afterwards He made the disciples go on board the boat and cross to the opposite shore, leaving Him to dismiss the people.
23621	40	14	23	 When He had done this, He climbed the hill to pray in solitude.  Night came on, and he was there alone.
23622	40	14	24	 Meanwhile the boat was  far out on the Lake, buffeted and tossed by the waves, the wind being adverse.
23623	40	14	25	 But  towards daybreak He went to them, walking over the waves.
23624	40	14	26	 When the disciples saw Him walking on the waves, they were greatly alarmed. "It is a spirit," they exclaimed, and they cried out with terror.
23625	40	14	27	 But instantly Jesus spoke to them, and said, "There is no danger;  it is I; do not be afraid."
23626	40	14	28	 "Master," answered Peter, "if it is you, bid me come to you upon the water."
23627	40	14	29	 "Come," said Jesus. Then Peter climbed down from the boat and walked upon the water  to go to Him.
23628	40	14	30	 But when he  felt  the wind he  grew frightened, and beginning to sink he cried out, "Master, save me."
23629	40	14	31	 Instantly Jesus stretched out His hand and caught hold of him, saying to him, "O little faith, why did you doubt?"
23630	40	14	32	 So they climbed into the boat, and the wind lulled;
23631	40	14	33	 and the men on board fell down before him and said, "You are indeed God's Son."
23632	40	14	34	  When they had quite crossed over, they put ashore at Gennesaret;
23633	40	14	35	 and the men of the place, recognizing Him, sent word into all the country round. So they brought all the sick to Him,
23634	40	14	36	 and they entreated Him that they might but touch the tassel of His outer garment; and all who did so were restored to perfect health.
23635	40	15	1	  Then there came to Jesus a party of Pharisees and Scribes from Jerusalem, who inquired,
23636	40	15	2	 "Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the Elders by not washing their hands  before meals?"
23637	40	15	3	 "Why do you, too," He retorted, "transgress God's commands  for the sake of  your tradition?
23638	40	15	4	 For God said, <`Honour thy father and thy mother';> and <`Let him who  reviles father or mother  be certainly put to death';>
23639	40	15	5	 but you--this is what you say: `If a man says to his father or mother, That is  consecrated, whatever it is, which otherwise you should have received from me--
23640	40	15	6	  he shall be absolved from honouring his father';  and so you have abrogated God's  Word for the sake of your tradition.
23641	40	15	7	 Hypocrites! well did Isaiah prophesy of you,
23642	40	15	8	 <"`This is a People who honour Me with their lips, while their heart is far away from Me;
23643	40	15	9	 but it is in vain they worship Me, while they lay down precepts which are mere human rules.'">
23644	40	15	10	 Then, when He had called the people to Him, Jesus said, "Hear and understand.
23645	40	15	11	 It is not what goes into a man's mouth that  defiles him; but it is what comes out of his mouth--*that* defiles a man."
23646	40	15	12	 Then His disciples came and said to Him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were greatly  shocked when they heard those words?"
23647	40	15	13	 "Every plant," He replied, "which my Heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.
23648	40	15	14	 Leave them alone. They are blind guides  of the blind; and if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into some  pit."
23649	40	15	15	 "Explain to us this figurative language," said Peter.
23650	40	15	16	 "Are even you," He answered, "still without intellingence?
23651	40	15	17	 Do you not understand that whatever enters the mouth passes into the stomach and is afterwards ejected from the body?
23652	40	15	18	 But the things that come out of the mouth proceed from the heart, and it is these that defile the man.
23653	40	15	19	 For out of the heart proceed wicked  thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, perjury, impiety of speech.
23654	40	15	20	 These are the things which defile the man; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile."
23655	40	15	21	  Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew into the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon.
23656	40	15	22	 Here a Canaanitish woman of the district came out and  persistently cried out, "Sir, Son of David, pity me; my daughter is cruelly harassed by a demon."
23657	40	15	23	 But He answered her not a word. Then the disciples interposed, and begged Him, saying, "Send her away because she keeps crying behind us."
23658	40	15	24	 "I have only been sent to the  lost sheep of the house of Israel," He replied.
23659	40	15	25	 Then she  came and  threw herself at His feet and entreated Him. "O Sir, help me," she said.
23660	40	15	26	 "It is not right," He said, "to take the children's bread and throw it to the  dogs."
23661	40	15	27	  "Be it so, Sir," she said,  "for even the dogs eat the scraps which fall from their  masters' tables."
23662	40	15	28	 "O woman," replied Jesus, "great is your faith: be it done to you as you desire." And from that moment her daughter was restored to health.
23663	40	15	29	 Again, moving thence, Jesus went along by the Lake of Galilee; and ascending  the hill, He  sat down there.
23664	40	15	30	 Soon great crowds came to Him, bringing with them those who were crippled in feet or hands, blind or  dumb, and many besides, and they hastened to lay them at His feet. And He cured them,
23665	40	15	31	 so that the people were amazed to see the dumb speaking,  the maimed with their hands perfect, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they gave the glory to the God of Israel.
23666	40	15	32	  But Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, "My heart yearns over this mass of people, for it is now  the third day that they have been with me and they have nothing to eat. I am unwilling to send them away hungry, lest they should faint on the road."
23667	40	15	33	 "Where can we," asked the disciples, "get bread enough in this remote place to satisfy so vast a multitude?"
23668	40	15	34	 "How many loaves have you?" Jesus asked. "Seven," they said, "and a few small fish."
23669	40	15	35	 So He bade all the people sit down on the ground,
23670	40	15	36	 and He took the seven loaves and the fish, and after giving thanks He broke them up and then distributed them to the disciples, and they to the people.
23671	40	15	37	 And they all ate and were satisfied. The broken portions that remained over they took up--seven full  hampers.
23672	40	15	38	 Those who ate were 4,000 adult men, without reckoning women and children.
23673	40	15	39	  He then dismissed the people, went on board the boat, and came into the district of Magadan.
23674	40	16	1	 Here the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Him; and, to make trial of Him, they asked Him to show them a sign  in the sky.
23675	40	16	2	  He replied,  "In the evening you say, `It will be fine weather, for the sky is red;'
23676	40	16	3	 and in the morning, `It will be rough weather to-day, for the sky is red and murky.' You learn how to distinguish the aspect of the heavens, but the signs of the times you cannot.
23677	40	16	4	  A wicked and faithless generation are eager for a sign; but none shall be given to them except the sign of Jonah." and He left them and went away.
23678	40	16	5	 When the disciples arrived at the other side  of the Lake, they found that they  had forgotten to bring any bread;
23679	40	16	6	 and when Jesus said to them, "See to it: beware of the  yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees,"
23680	40	16	7	 they reasoned among themselves, saying,  "It is because we have not brought any bread."
23681	40	16	8	 Jesus perceived this and said, "Why are you reasoning among yourselves, you men of little faith, because  you have no bread?
23682	40	16	9	 Do you not yet understand? nor even remember the 5,000 and the five loaves, and how many basketfuls you carried away,
23683	40	16	10	 nor the 4,000 and the seven loaves, and how many hampers you carried away?
23684	40	16	11	 How is it you do not understand that it was not about bread that I spoke to you? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
23685	40	16	12	 Then they perceived that He had not warned them against bread-yeast, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
23686	40	16	13	  When He arrived in the neighbourhood of Caesarea Philippi, Jesus  questioned His disciples. "Who do people  say that the Son of Man is?" He asked.
23687	40	16	14	 "Some say John the Baptist," they replied; "others Elijah; others Jeremiah or one of the Prophets."
23688	40	16	15	 "But you, who do you say that I am?" He asked again.
23689	40	16	16	 "You," replied  Simon Peter, "are the Christ, the Son of the  ever-living God."
23690	40	16	17	 "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-jonah," said Jesus; "for  mere human nature has not revealed this to you, but my Father in Heaven.
23691	40	16	18	 And I declare to you that you are  Peter, and that upon this  Rock I will build my Church, and the  might of Hades shall not triumph over it.
23692	40	16	19	 I will give  you the keys of the Kingdom of the Heavens; and whatever you bind on earth shall  remain bound in Heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall remain loosed in Heaven."
23693	40	16	20	 Then He urged His disciples to tell no one that He was the Christ.
23694	40	16	21	 From this time  Jesus began to explain to His disciples that He  must go to Jerusalem, and suffer much cruelty from the Elders and the High Priests and the Scribes, and be put to death, and on the third day  be raised to life again.
23695	40	16	22	 Then Peter  took Him aside and began taking Him to task. "Master," he said,  "God forbid; this  will not be your lot."
23696	40	16	23	 But He turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me,  Adversary; you are a  hindrance to me, because your thoughts are not God's thoughts, but men's."
23697	40	16	24	 Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If any one desires to follow me, let him renounce self and take up his cross, and so be my follower.
23698	40	16	25	 For whoever desires to save his  life shall lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake  shall find it.
23699	40	16	26	 Why, what benefit will it be to a man if he gains the whole world but  forfeits his life? Or what shall a man give  to buy back his life?
23700	40	16	27	 For the Son of Man is soon to come in the glory of the Father with  His angels, and then will He requite every man according to his actions.
23701	40	16	28	 I solemnly tell you that some of those who are standing here will certainly not taste death till they have  seen the Son of Man coming in His Kingdom."
23702	40	17	1	  Six day later, Jesus took with Him Peter and the brothers James and John, and brought them up  a high mountain to a solitary place.
23703	40	17	2	 There in their presence His form underwent a change; His face shone like the sun, and His raiment became as white as the light.
23704	40	17	3	 And suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared to them conversing with Him.
23705	40	17	4	 Then Peter said to Jesus, "Master,  we are thankful to you that we are here. If you approve, I will put up three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
23706	40	17	5	 He was still speaking when a luminous cloud  spread over them; and a voice was heard from within the cloud, which said, "This is My Son dearly beloved, in whom is My delight. Listen to Him."
23707	40	17	6	 On hearing this voice, the disciples fell on their faces and were filled with terror.
23708	40	17	7	 But Jesus came and touched them, and said, "Rouse yourselves and have no fear."
23709	40	17	8	 So they looked up, and saw no one but Jesus.
23710	40	17	9	 As they were descending the mountain, Jesus laid a command upon them. "Tell no one," He said, "of the sight you have seen till the Son of Man has risen from among the dead."
23711	40	17	10	 "Why then," asked the disciples, "do the Scribes say that Elijah must first come?"
23712	40	17	11	 "Elijah was indeed to come," He replied, "and would reform everything.
23713	40	17	12	 But I tell you that he has already come, and they did not recognize him, but dealt with him as they chose. And before long the Son of Man will be treated by them in a similar way."
23714	40	17	13	 Then it dawned upon the disciples that it was John the Baptist about whom He had spoken to them.
23715	40	17	14	  When they had returned to the people, there came to Him a man who fell on his knees before Him and besought Him.
23716	40	17	15	 "Sir," he said, "have pity on my son, for he is an epileptic and is very ill. Often he falls into the fire and often into the water.
23717	40	17	16	 I have brought him to your disciples, and they have not been able to cure him."
23718	40	17	17	  "O unbelieving and  perverse generation!" replied Jesus; "how long shall I be with you? how long shall I endure you? Bring him  to me."
23719	40	17	18	 Then Jesus reprimanded the demon, and it came out and left him; and the boy was cured from that moment.
23720	40	17	19	 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked Him, "Why could not we expel the demon?"
23721	40	17	20	 "Because your faith is so small," He replied; "for I solemnly declare to you that if you have faith  like a mustard-seed, you shall say to this mountain, `Remove from this place to that,' and it will remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.
23722	40	17	21	  But an evil spirit of this kind is only driven out by prayer and fasting."
23723	40	17	22	  As they were  travelling about in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men;
23724	40	17	23	 they will put Him to death, but on the third day He will be raised to life again." And they were exceedingly distressed.
23725	40	17	24	  After their arrival at Capernaum the collectors of the half-shekel came and asked Peter, "Does not your Teacher pay  the half-shekel?"
23726	40	17	25	 "Yes," he replied, and then went into the house. But before he spoke a word Jesus said, "What think you, Simon? From whom do this world's kings receive customs or capitation tax? from their own children, or from others?"
23727	40	17	26	 "From others," he replied. "Then  the children go free," said Jesus.
23728	40	17	27	 "However, lest we  cause them to sin, go and throw a hook into the Lake, and take the first fish that comes up. When you open its mouth, you will find a shekel in it: bring that coin and give it to them  for yourself and me."
23729	40	18	1	  Just  then the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who  ranks higher than others in the Kingdom of the Heavens?"
23730	40	18	2	 So He called a young child to Him, and, bidding him stand in the midst of them,
23731	40	18	3	 said, "In solemn truth I tell you that unless you  turn and become like little children, you will in no case be admitted into the Kingdom of the Heavens.
23732	40	18	4	 Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this young child, he it is who  is superior to others in the Kingdom of the Heavens.
23733	40	18	5	 And whoever for my sake receives one young child such as this, receives me.
23734	40	18	6	  But whoever shall  occasion the fall of one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be better for him to have a  millstone hung round his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
23735	40	18	7	 "Alas for the world because of causes of falling! They cannot but come, but alas for each man through whom they come!
23736	40	18	8	 If your hand or your foot is causing you to fall into sin, cut it off and away with it. It is better for you to enter  into Life crippled in hand or foot than to remain in possession of two sound hands or feet but be thrown into the fire  of the Ages.
23737	40	18	9	 And if your eye is causing you to fall into sin, tear it out and away with it; it is better for you to enter into Life with only one eye, than to remain in possession of two eyes but be thrown into the  Gehenna of fire.
23738	40	18	10	  "Beware of ever despising one of these little ones, for I tell you that in Heaven  their angels  have continual access to my Father who is in Heaven.
23739	40	18	11	  []
23740	40	18	12	 What do you yourselves think? Suppose a man gets a hundred sheep and one of them strays away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go and look for the one that is straying?
23741	40	18	13	 And if he succeeds in finding it, in solemn truth I tell you that he rejoices over it more than he does over the ninety-nine that have not gone astray.
23742	40	18	14	 Just so it is not the will  of your Father in Heaven that one of these little ones should be lost.
23743	40	18	15	 "If your brother  acts wrongly  towards you, go and point out his fault to him when only you and he are there. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
23744	40	18	16	 But if he will not listen to you, go again, and ask one or two to go with you, that every word spoken may be attested by two or three witnesses.
23745	40	18	17	 If he refuses to hear them, appeal to  the Church; and if he refuses to hear even  the Church,  regard him just as you regard a Gentile or a tax-gatherer.
23746	40	18	18	 I solemnly tell you that whatever you  as a Church bind on earth will in Heaven be held as bound, and whatever you loose on earth will in Heaven be held to be loosed.
23747	40	18	19	 I also solemnly tell you that if two of you here on earth agree together concerning anything whatever that they shall ask, the boon will come to them from my Father who is in Heaven.
23748	40	18	20	 For where there are two or three assembled in my name, there am I  in the midst of them."
23749	40	18	21	  At this point Peter came to Him with the question, "Master, how often shall my brother act wrongly towards me and I forgive him? seven times?"
23750	40	18	22	 "I do not say seven times," answered Jesus, "but  seventy times seven times.
23751	40	18	23	 "For this reason the Kingdom of the Heavens  may be compared to  a king who determined to have a settlement of accounts with his  servants.
23752	40	18	24	 But as soon as he began the settlement, one was brought before him who owed  10,000 talents,
23753	40	18	25	 and was unable to pay. So his  master ordered that he and his wife and children and everything that he had should be sold, and payment be made.
23754	40	18	26	 The servant therefore falling down, prostrated himself at his feet and entreated him. "`Only give me time,' he said, `and I will pay you the whole.'
23755	40	18	27	 "Whereupon his master, touched with compassion, set him free and forgave him the  debt.
23756	40	18	28	 But no sooner had that servant gone out, than he met with one of his fellow servants who owed him 100  shillings; and seizing him by the throat and nearly strangling him he exclaimed, "`Pay me all you owe.'
23757	40	18	29	 "His fellow servant therefore fell at his feet and entreated him, "`Only give me time,' he said, `and I will pay you.'
23758	40	18	30	 "He would not, however, but went and threw him into prison until he should pay what was due.
23759	40	18	31	 His fellow servants, therefore, seeing what had happened, were exceedingly angry; and they came and told their master without reserve all that had happened.
23760	40	18	32	 At once his master called him and said, "`Wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt, because you entreated me:
23761	40	18	33	 ought not you also to have had pity on your fellow servant, just as I had pity on you?'
23762	40	18	34	 "So his master, greatly incensed, handed him over to the  jailers until he should pay all he owed him.
23763	40	18	35	 "In the same way  my Heavenly Father will deal with you, if you do not all of you forgive one another from your hearts."
23764	40	19	1	  When Jesus had finished these discourses, He removed from Galilee and came into that  part of Judaea which lay beyond the Jordan.
23765	40	19	2	 And a vast multitude followed him, and He cured them there.
23766	40	19	3	  Then came  some of the Pharisees to Him to put Him to the proof by the question, "Has a man a right to divorce his wife  whenever he chooses?"
23767	40	19	4	 "Have you not read," He replied, "that He who made them <`made them'> from the beginning <`male and female,
23768	40	19	5	 and said, For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and  be united to his wife, and the two shall be  one'?>
23769	40	19	6	 Thus they are no longer two, but  `one'! What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate."
23770	40	19	7	 "Why then," said they, "did Moses command the husband to give her `a written notice of divorce,' and so put her away?"
23771	40	19	8	 "Moses," He replied,  "in consideration of the  hardness of your nature permitted you to put away your wives, but it has not been so from the beginning.
23772	40	19	9	 And I tell you that whoever divorces his wife for any reason except her unfaithfulness, and marries another woman,  commits adultery."
23773	40	19	10	 "If this is the case with a man in relation to his wife," said the disciples to Him, "it is better not to marry."
23774	40	19	11	 "It is not every man," He replied, "who can receive this teaching, but  only those on whom the grace has been bestowed.
23775	40	19	12	 There are men who from their birth have been disabled from marriage, others who have been so disabled by men, and others who have disabled themselves for the sake of the Kingdom of the Heavens. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it."
23776	40	19	13	  Then young children were brought to Him for Him to put His hands on them and pray; but the disciples interfered.
23777	40	19	14	 Jesus however said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them; for it is to those who are childlike that the Kingdom of the Heavens belongs."
23778	40	19	15	 So He laid His hands upon them and went away.
23779	40	19	16	  "Teacher," said one man, coming up to Him, "what that is good shall I do in order to win the Life  of the Ages?"
23780	40	19	17	  "Why do you ask me," He replied, "about what is good? There is only One who is truly good. But if you desire to enter into Life, keep the Commandments."
23781	40	19	18	  "Which Commandments?" he asked. Jesus answered, <"`Thou shalt not kill;' `Thou shalt not commit adultery;' `Thou shalt not steal;' `Thou shalt not lie in giving evidence;'
23782	40	19	19	 `Honour thy father and thy mother'; and `Thou shalt love thy fellow man as much as thyself.'">
23783	40	19	20	 "All of these," said the young man, "I have  carefully kept. What do I still lack?"
23784	40	19	21	 "If you desire to be perfect," replied Jesus, "go and sell all that you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have wealth in Heaven; and come, follow me."
23785	40	19	22	 On hearing those words the young man went away much cast down; for he had much property.
23786	40	19	23	 So Jesus said to His disciples, "I solemnly tell you that it is with difficulty that a rich man will enter the Kingdom of the Heavens.
23787	40	19	24	 Yes, I tell you, it is easier for a  camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God."
23788	40	19	25	 These words utterly amazed the disciples, and they asked, "Who then can be saved?"
23789	40	19	26	 Jesus looked at them and said, "With men this is impossible, but with God everything is possible."
23790	40	19	27	 Then Peter said to Jesus, "See, *we* have forsaken everything and followed you; what then will be *our* reward?"
23791	40	19	28	 "I solemnly tell you," replied Jesus, "that  in the New Creation, when the Son of Man has taken His seat on  His glorious throne, all of you who have followed me shall also sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.
23792	40	19	29	 And whoever has forsaken houses, or brothers or sisters, or father  or mother, or children or lands, for my sake, shall receive  many times as much and shall have as his inheritance the Life  of the Ages.
23793	40	19	30	 "But many who are now first will be last, and many who are now last will be first.
23794	40	20	1	 "For the Kingdom of the Heavens is like  an employer who went out early in the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard,
23795	40	20	2	 and having made an agreement with them for a shilling a day, sent them into his vineyard.
23796	40	20	3	 About nine o'clock he went out and saw others loitering in the market-place.
23797	40	20	4	 To these also he said, "`You also, go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.'
23798	40	20	5	 "So they went. Again about twelve, and about three o'clock, he went out and did the same.
23799	40	20	6	 And going out about five o'clock he found others loitering, and he asked them, "`Why  have you been standing here all day long, doing nothing?'
23800	40	20	7	 "`Because  no one has hired us,' they replied. "`You also, go into the vineyard,' he said.
23801	40	20	8	 "When evening came, the master said to his steward, "`Call the men and pay them their wages. Begin with the last set and finish with the first.'
23802	40	20	9	 "When those came who had begun at five o'clock, they received a shilling apiece;
23803	40	20	10	 and when the first came, they expected to get more, but they also each got  the shilling.
23804	40	20	11	 So when they had received it, they grumbled against the employer, saying,
23805	40	20	12	 "`These who came last  have done  only one hour's work, and  you have put them on a level with us who have worked the whole day and have borne the scorching heat.'
23806	40	20	13	 "`My friend,' he answered to one of them, `I am doing you no injustice.  Did you not agree with me for a shilling?
23807	40	20	14	 Take your money and go. I choose to give this last comer just as much as I give you.
23808	40	20	15	 Have I not a right to do what I choose with my own property? Or are you envious because I am  generous?'
23809	40	20	16	 "So the last shall be first, and the first last."
23810	40	20	17	  Jesus was now going up to Jerusalem, and He took the twelve disciples aside by themselves, and on the way He said to them,
23811	40	20	18	 "We are going up to Jerusalem, and there the Son of Man will be betrayed to the High Priests and Scribes. They will condemn Him to death,
23812	40	20	19	 and hand Him over to the Gentiles to be made sport of and scourged and crucified; and on the third day He  will be raised to life."
23813	40	20	20	  Then the mother of the sons of Zabdi came to Him with her sons, and knelt before Him to make a request of Him.
23814	40	20	21	 "What is it you desire?" He asked. "Command," she replied, "that these my two sons may sit one at your right hand and one at your left in  your Kingdom."
23815	40	20	22	 "None of you know what you are asking for," said Jesus; "can you drink  out of the cup  from which I am about to drink?" "We can," they replied.
23816	40	20	23	 "You shall drink out of my cup," He said, "but a seat at my right hand or at my left it is not for me to allot, but it belongs to those for whom it has been  prepared by my Father."
23817	40	20	24	 The  other ten heard of this, and their indignation was aroused  against the two brothers.
23818	40	20	25	 But Jesus called them to Him, and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them.
23819	40	20	26	 Not so  shall it be among you; but whoever desires to be great among you shall be your servant,
23820	40	20	27	 and whoever desires to be first among you shall be your bondservant;
23821	40	20	28	 just as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give His life as the  redemption-price  for many."
23822	40	20	29	  As they were leaving Jericho, an immense crowd following Him,
23823	40	20	30	 two blind men sitting by the roadside heard that it was Jesus who was passing by, and cried aloud, "Sir, Son of David, pity us."
23824	40	20	31	 The people angrily tried to silence them, but they cried all the louder. "O Sir, Son of David, pity us," they said.
23825	40	20	32	 So Jesus stood still and called to them. "What shall I do for you?" He asked.
23826	40	20	33	 "Sir, let our eyes be opened," they replied.
23827	40	20	34	 Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him.
23828	40	21	1	  When they were come near Jerusalem and had arrived at Bethphage and the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of the disciples on in front,
23829	40	21	2	 saying to them, "Go to the village you see facing you, and as you enter it you will find a she-ass tied up and a foal with her. Untie her and  bring them to me.
23830	40	21	3	 And if any one says anything to you, say,  `The Master needs them,' and he will at once send them."
23831	40	21	4	 This  took place in order that the Prophet's prediction might be fulfilled:
23832	40	21	5	 <"Tell the  Daughter of Zion, `See, thy King is coming  to thee, gentle,  and yet mounted on an ass, even on a colt the  foal of a beast of burden.'">
23833	40	21	6	 So the disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them:
23834	40	21	7	 they brought the she-ass and the foal, and threw their outer garments on them. So He sat on them;
23835	40	21	8	 and most of the crowd kept spreading their garments along the road, while others  cut branches from the trees and  carpeted the road with them,
23836	40	21	9	 and the multitudes--some of the people preceding Him and some following--sang aloud,  <"God save the Son of David! Blessings on Him who comes in the Lord's name! God in the highest Heavens save Him!">
23837	40	21	10	 When He thus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was thrown into commotion, every one inquiring, "Who is this?"
23838	40	21	11	 "This is Jesus, the Prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee," replied the crowds.
23839	40	21	12	  Entering  the Temple, Jesus drove out all who were buying and selling there, and overturned the money-changers' tables and the seats of the pigeon-dealers.
23840	40	21	13	 "It is written," He said, <"`My House shall be called  the House of Prayer',> but you are making it <a robbers' cave.">
23841	40	21	14	 And  the blind and the lame came to Him in the Temple, and He cured them.
23842	40	21	15	 But when the High Priests and the Scribes saw the wonderful things that He had done and the children who were crying aloud in the Temple, <"God save the Son of David,"> they were filled with indignation.
23843	40	21	16	 "Do you hear," they asked Him, "what these children are saying?" "Yes," He replied; "have you never read, <`Out of the mouths of infants and of babes at the breast Thou hast brought forth the praise which is due'?">
23844	40	21	17	 So He left them and went out of the city to Bethany and passed the night there.
23845	40	21	18	  Early in the morning  as He was on His way to return to the city He was hungry,
23846	40	21	19	 and seeing  a fig-tree on the road-side He went up to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. "On you," He said, "no fruit shall ever again grow." And immediately the fig-tree withered away.
23847	40	21	20	  When the disciples saw it they exclaimed in astonishment, "How instantaneously the fig-tree has withered away!"
23848	40	21	21	 "I solemnly tell you," said Jesus, "that if you have an unwavering faith, you shall not only perform such a miracle as this of the fig-tree, but that even if you say to this mountain, `Be thou lifted up and hurled into the sea,' it shall be done;
23849	40	21	22	 and everything, whatever it be, that you ask for in your prayers, if you have faith, you shall obtain."
23850	40	21	23	  He entered the Temple; and while He was teaching, the High Priests and the Elders of the people came to Him and asked Him, "By  what authority are you doing  these things? and who gave you this authority?"
23851	40	21	24	 "And I also have a question to ask *you*," replied Jesus, "and if you answer me, I in turn will tell you by what authority I do these things.
23852	40	21	25	 John's Baptism, whence was it? --had it a heavenly or a human origin?" So they debated the matter among themselves. "If we say `a heavenly origin,'" they argued, "he will say, `Why then did you not believe him?'
23853	40	21	26	 and if we say `a human origin' we have the people to fear, for they all hold John to have been a Prophet."
23854	40	21	27	 So they answered Jesus, "We do not know."  "Nor do I tell you," He replied, "by what authority I do these things."
23855	40	21	28	 "But give me your judgement. There was a man who had two  sons. He came to the elder of them, and said, "`My  son, go and work in the vineyard to-day.'
23856	40	21	29	 "`I will not,' he replied. "But afterwards he was sorry, and went.
23857	40	21	30	 He came to the second and spoke in the same manner. His answer was, "`I will go, Sir.' "But he did not go.
23858	40	21	31	 Which of the two did as his father desired?"  "The first," they said. "I solemnly tell you,' replied Jesus, "that the tax-gatherers and the notorious sinners are entering the Kingdom of God  in front of you.
23859	40	21	32	 For John came to you observing all sorts of ritual, and you put no faith in him: the tax-gatherers and the notorious sinners did put faith in him, and you, though you saw this example set you, were not even afterwards sorry so as to believe him.
23860	40	21	33	  "Listen to another parable. There was a householder who planted a vineyard, made a fence round it, dug a wine-tank in it, and built a strong lodge; then let the place to vine-dressers, and went abroad.
23861	40	21	34	 When vintage-time approached, he sent his  servants to the vine-dressers to receive his share of the  grapes;
23862	40	21	35	 but the vine-dressers seized the servants, and one they cruelly beat, one they killed, one they pelted with stones.
23863	40	21	36	 Again he sent another party of servants more numerous than the first; and these they treated in the same manner.
23864	40	21	37	 Later still he sent to them  his son,  saying, "`They will respect my son.'
23865	40	21	38	 "But the vine-dressers, when they saw the son, said to one another, "`Here is the heir: come, let us kill him and get his inheritance.'
23866	40	21	39	 "So they seized him, dragged him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
23867	40	21	40	 When then the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-dressers?"
23868	40	21	41	 "He will put the wretches to a wretched death," was the reply, "and will entrust the vineyard to other vine-dressers who will render the produce to him at the vintage season."
23869	40	21	42	 "Have you never read in the Scriptures," said Jesus, <"`The Stone which the builders rejected has been made the Cornerstone: this Cornerstone  came from the Lord, and is wonderful in our eyes'?>
23870	40	21	43	 "That, I tell you, is the reason why the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and given to a nation  that will exhibit the power  of it.
23871	40	21	44	 He who  falls on this stone will be severely hurt; but he on whom it falls will be utterly crushed."
23872	40	21	45	 After listening to His parables the High Priests and the Pharisees perceived that He was speaking about them;
23873	40	21	46	 but though they were eager to lay hands upon Him, they were afraid of the people, for by them He was regarded as a Prophet.
23874	40	22	1	  Again Jesus spoke to them in figurative language.
23875	40	22	2	 "The Kingdom of the Heavens," He said,  "may be compared to  a king who celebrated the marriage of his son,
23876	40	22	3	 and sent his  servants to call the invited guests to the wedding, but they were unwilling to come.
23877	40	22	4	 "Again he sent other servants with a message to those who were invited. "`My  breakfast is now ready," he said, `my bullocks and fat cattle are killed, and every preparation is made: come to the wedding.'
23878	40	22	5	 "They however gave no heed, but went, one to his home in the country, another to his business;
23879	40	22	6	 and the rest seized the king's servants, maltreated them, and murdered them.
23880	40	22	7	 So the king's anger was stirred, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burnt their city.
23881	40	22	8	 Then he said to his servants, "`The wedding banquet is ready, but those who were invited were unworthy of it.
23882	40	22	9	 Go out therefore to the crossroads, and everybody you meet invite to the wedding.'
23883	40	22	10	 "So they went out into the roads and gathered together all they  could find, both bad and good, and the  banqueting hall was filled with guests.
23884	40	22	11	 "Now the king came in to see the guests; and among them he discovered one who was not wearing a wedding-robe.
23885	40	22	12	 "`My friend,' he said, `how is it that you came in here without a wedding robe?'
23886	40	22	13	 "The man  stood speechless. Then the king said to the servants, "`Bind him hand and foot and fling him into the darkness outside: there will be the weeping aloud and the gnashing of teeth.'
23887	40	22	14	 "For there are many called, but few chosen."
23888	40	22	15	  Then the Pharisees went and consulted together how they might entrap Him in His conversation.
23889	40	22	16	 So they sent to Him their disciples together with the Herodians;  who said, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and that you faithfully teach God's truth; and that no fear of man misleads you, for you  are not biased by men's wealth or rank.
23890	40	22	17	 Give us your judgement therefore: is it allowable for us to pay a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?"
23891	40	22	18	 Perceiving their wickedness, Jesus replied, "Why are you hypocrites trying to ensnare me?
23892	40	22	19	 Show me the tribute coin." And they brought Him a shilling.
23893	40	22	20	 "Whose likeness and inscription," He asked, "is this?"
23894	40	22	21	 "Caesar's," they replied. "Pay therefore," He rejoined, "what is Caesar's to Caesar; and what is God's to God."
23895	40	22	22	 They heard this, and were astonished; then left Him, and went their way.
23896	40	22	23	  On the same day a party of Sadducees came to Him, contending that there is no resurrection. And they put this case to Him.
23897	40	22	24	 "Teacher," they said, "Moses enjoined, <`If a man die childless, his brother shall marry his widow, and raise up a family for him.'>
23898	40	22	25	 Now we had among us seven brothers. The eldest of them married, but died childless, leaving his wife to his brother.
23899	40	22	26	 So also did the second and the third, down to the seventh,
23900	40	22	27	 till the woman also died, after surviving them all.
23901	40	22	28	 At the Resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? for they all married her."
23902	40	22	29	 The reply of Jesus was, "You are in error, through ignorance of the Scriptures and of the power of God.
23903	40	22	30	 For in the Resurrection, men neither marry nor are women given in marriage, but they are like  angels in Heaven.
23904	40	22	31	 But as to the Resurrection of the dead, have you never read what God says to you,
23905	40	22	32	 <`I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?> He is not the God of dead, but of living men."
23906	40	22	33	 All the crowd heard this, and were filled with amazement at His teaching.
23907	40	22	34	  Now the Pharisees came up when they heard that He  had silenced the Sadducees,
23908	40	22	35	 and one of them, an expounder of the Law, asked Him as a test question,
23909	40	22	36	 "Teacher,  which is the  greatest Commandment in the Law?"
23910	40	22	37	 <"`Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,'"> He answered,  <"`with thy whole heart, thy whole soul, thy whole mind.'>
23911	40	22	38	 This is the greatest and foremost Commandment.
23912	40	22	39	 And the second is similar to it: <`Thou shalt love thy fellow man  as much as thyself.'
23913	40	22	40	 The whole of the Law and the Prophets is summed up in these two Commandments."
23914	40	22	41	  While the Pharisees were still assembled there, Jesus put a question to them.
23915	40	22	42	 "What think you about the Christ," He said, "whose son is He?" "David's," they replied.
23916	40	22	43	 "How then," He asked, "does David,  taught by the Spirit, call Him Lord, when he says,
23917	40	22	44	 <"`The Lord said to my Lord, sit at My right hand until I have put thy foes beneath thy feet'?>
23918	40	22	45	 "If therefore David calls Him Lord, how can He be his son?"
23919	40	22	46	 No one could say a word in reply, nor from that day did any one venture again to put a question to Him.
23920	40	23	1	  Then Jesus addressed the crowds and His disciples.
23921	40	23	2	 "The Scribes," He said, "and the Pharisees  sit in the chair of Moses.
23922	40	23	3	 Therefore do and observe everything that they command you; but do not imitate their lives, for though they tell others what to do, they do not do it themselves.
23923	40	23	4	  Heavy  and cumbrous burdens they bind together and load men's shoulders with them, while as for themselves, not with one finger do they choose to lift them.
23924	40	23	5	 And everything they do they do with a view to being observed by men; for they widen their  phylacteries and make the tassels large,
23925	40	23	6	 and love the best seats at a dinner party or in the synagogues,
23926	40	23	7	 and like to be bowed to in places of public resort, and to be addressed by men as `Rabbi.'
23927	40	23	8	 "As for you, do not accept the title of `Rabbi,' for one alone is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.
23928	40	23	9	 And call no one on earth your Father, for One alone is your Father--the Heavenly Father.
23929	40	23	10	 And do not accept the name of `leader,' for your Leader is one alone--the Christ.
23930	40	23	11	 He who is the greatest among you shall be your servant;
23931	40	23	12	 and one who exalts himself shall be abased, while one who abases himself shall be exalted.
23932	40	23	13	 "But alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you lock the door of the Kingdom of the Heavens against men; you yourselves do not enter, nor do you allow those to enter who are seeking to do so.
23933	40	23	14	  []
23934	40	23	15	 "Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you scour sea and land in order to win one convert--and when he is gained, you make him twice as much a son of Gehenna as yourselves.
23935	40	23	16	 "Alas for you, you blind guides, who say, "`Whoever swears by  the Sanctuary it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the Sanctuary, is bound by the oath.'
23936	40	23	17	 "Blind fools!  Why, which is greater? --the gold, or the Sanctuary which has made the gold holy?
23937	40	23	18	 And you say, "`Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the offering lying on it is bound by the oath.'
23938	40	23	19	 "You are blind! Why, which is greater? --the offering, or the altar which makes the offering holy?
23939	40	23	20	 He who swears by the altar swears both by it and by everything on it;
23940	40	23	21	 he who swears by the Sanctuary swears both by it and by Him who  dwells in it;
23941	40	23	22	 and he who swears by Heaven swears both by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.
23942	40	23	23	  "Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you pay the tithe on mint, dill, and cumin, while you have neglected the weightier requirements of the Law--just judgement, mercy, and faithful dealing. These things you ought to have done, and yet you ought not to have left the others undone.
23943	40	23	24	 You blind guides, straining out the gnat while you gulp down the camel!
23944	40	23	25	  "Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you wash clean the outside of the cup or dish, while within they are full of greed and  self-indulgence.
23945	40	23	26	 Blind Pharisee, first wash clean the inside of the cup  or dish, and then the outside will be clean also.
23946	40	23	27	 "Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you are just like whitewashed sepulchres, the outside of which pleases the eye, though inside they are full of dead men's bones and of all that is unclean.
23947	40	23	28	 The same is true of you: outwardly you seem to the human eye to be good and honest men, but, within, you are full of insincerity and  disregard of God's Law.
23948	40	23	29	  "Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you repair the sepulchres of the Prophets and  keep in order the tombs of the righteous,
23949	40	23	30	 and your boast is, "`If we had lived in the time of our forefathers, we should not have been implicated with them in the murder of the Prophets.'
23950	40	23	31	 "So that you bear witness against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the Prophets.
23951	40	23	32	 Fill up the measure of your forefathers' guilt.
23952	40	23	33	 O serpents, O vipers' brood, how are you  to escape  condemnation to  Gehenna?
23953	40	23	34	  "For this reason I am sending to you Prophets and wise men and Scribes. Some of them you will put to death--nay, crucify; some of them you will flog in your synagogues and chase from town to town;
23954	40	23	35	 that all the innocent blood  shed upon earth may come on you, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Berechiah whom you murdered between the Sanctuary and the altar.
23955	40	23	36	 I tell you in solemn truth that all these things will come upon the present generation.
23956	40	23	37	 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! thou who murderest the Prophets and stonest those who have been sent to thee! how often have I desired to gather thy children to me, just as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you would not come!
23957	40	23	38	 See, your house  will now be left to you  desolate!
23958	40	23	39	 For I tell you that you will never see me again until you say,  <`Blessed be He who comes in the name of the Lord.'">
23959	40	24	1	 Jesus had left  the Temple and was going on His way, when His disciples came and called His attention to the Temple  buildings.
23960	40	24	2	 "You see all these?" He replied; "in solemn truth I tell you that there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be pulled down."
23961	40	24	3	 Afterwards He was on the Mount of Olives and was seated there when the disciples came to Him, apart from the others, and said, "Tell us when this will be; and what will be the sign of your  Coming and of the Close of the  Age?"
23962	40	24	4	 "Take care that no one misleads you," answered Jesus;
23963	40	24	5	 "for many will come  assuming my name and saying `I am the Christ;' and they will mislead many.
23964	40	24	6	 And before long you will hear of wars and rumours of wars. Do not be alarmed, for such things must be; but the  End is not yet.
23965	40	24	7	 <For nation will rise in arms against nation, kingdom against kingdom,> and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places;
23966	40	24	8	 but all these miseries are but like the early pains of childbirth.
23967	40	24	9	 "At that time they will deliver you up to punishment and will put you to death; and you will be objects of hatred to all the nations because you are called by my name.
23968	40	24	10	 Then <will many  stumble and fall,> and they will betray one another and hate one another.
23969	40	24	11	 Many false prophets will rise up and lead multitudes astray;
23970	40	24	12	 and because of the prevalent  disregard of God's law the love of  the great majority will grow cold;
23971	40	24	13	 but those who stand firm to  the End shall be saved.
23972	40	24	14	 And  this Good News of the Kingdom shall be proclaimed throughout  the whole world to set the evidence before all the  Gentiles; and then  the End will come.
23973	40	24	15	  "When you have seen (to use the language of the Prophet Daniel) the <`Abomination of Desolation',> standing in the Holy Place" --let the reader observe those words--
23974	40	24	16	 "then let those who are in Judaea escape to the hills;
23975	40	24	17	 let him who is on the roof not go down to fetch what is in his house;
23976	40	24	18	 nor let him who is outside the city stay to pick up his outer garment.
23977	40	24	19	 And  alas for the women who at that time are with child or have infants!
23978	40	24	20	 "But pray that your flight may not be  in winter, nor on  the Sabbath;
23979	40	24	21	 for it <will be> a time of great <suffering, such as never has been from the beginning of the world till now,> and assuredly  never will be again.
23980	40	24	22	 And if those days had not  been cut short, no one would escape; but for the sake of  God's own People those days  will be cut short.
23981	40	24	23	  "If at that time any one should say to you, `See, here is the Christ!' or `Here!' give no credence to it.
23982	40	24	24	 For there will rise up false Christs and false prophets, displaying wonderful signs and prodigies, so as to deceive, were it possible, even God's own People.
23983	40	24	25	 Remember, I have forewarned you.
23984	40	24	26	 If therefore they should say to you, `See, He is in the Desert!' do not go out there: or `See, He is indoors in the room!' do not believe it.
23985	40	24	27	 For just as the lightning flashes in the east and is seen to the very west, so will be the Coming of the Son of Man.
23986	40	24	28	 Wherever the dead body is, there will the  vultures flock together.
23987	40	24	29	 "But immediately after those times of distress <the sun will  be darkened, the moon will not shed her light, the stars will fall from the firmament, and the  forces which control the heavens will be disordered and disturbed.>
23988	40	24	30	 Then will appear the Sign of the Son of Man in the sky; and <then will all the  nations of the earth lament,> when they  see the Son of Man <coming on the clouds of the sky>  with great power and glory.
23989	40	24	31	 And He will send out His angels  <with a loud trumpet-blast,> and <they will  bring together His own People to Him from north, south, east and west--from one extremity of the world to the other.>
23990	40	24	32	 "Now learn from the fig-tree the lesson it teaches. As soon as its branches have now become soft and it is bursting into leaf, you all know that summer is near.
23991	40	24	33	 So you also, when you see all these signs, may be sure that  He is near--at your very door.
23992	40	24	34	 I tell you in solemn truth that  the present generation will certainly not pass away without all these things having first taken place.
23993	40	24	35	  Earth and sky will pass away, but it is certain that my words will not pass away.
23994	40	24	36	 "But as to that day and the exact time no one knows--not even the angels of heaven,  nor the Son, but the Father alone.
23995	40	24	37	  `For as it was in the time of Noah, so it will be at the Coming of the Son of Man.
23996	40	24	38	 At that time, before the Deluge, men were busy eating and drinking, taking wives or giving them, up to the very day when Noah entered the Ark,
23997	40	24	39	 nor did they realise any danger till the Deluge came and swept them all away; so will it be at the Coming of the Son of Man.
23998	40	24	40	 Then will two men be in the open country: one  will be  taken away, and one left behind.
23999	40	24	41	 Two women will be grinding at the mill: one  will be  taken away, and one left behind.
24000	40	24	42	 Be  on the alert therefore, for you do not know the day on which your Lord is coming.
24001	40	24	43	  But of this be assured, that if the master of the house had known the hour at which the robber was coming, he would have kept awake, and not have allowed his house to be broken into.
24002	40	24	44	 Therefore you also must be ready; for it is at a time when you do not expect Him that the Son of Man will come.
24003	40	24	45	 "Who therefore is the loyal and intelligent  servant to whom his  master has entrusted the control of his household to give them their rations at the appointed time?
24004	40	24	46	 Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes shall find so doing!
24005	40	24	47	 In solemn truth I tell you that he will give him the management of all his wealth.
24006	40	24	48	 But if the man, being a bad servant, should say in his heart, `My master is a long time in coming,'
24007	40	24	49	 and should begin to beat his fellow servants, while he eats and drinks with drunkards;
24008	40	24	50	 the master of that servant will arrive on a day when he is not expecting him and at an hour of which he has not been informed;
24009	40	24	51	 he will  treat him with the utmost severity and assign him a place among the  hypocrites: there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
24010	40	25	1	 "Then will the Kingdom of the Heavens  be found to be like ten bridesmaids who took their torches and went out to meet the bridegroom.
24011	40	25	2	 Five of them were foolish and five were wise.
24012	40	25	3	 For the foolish, when they took their torches, did not provide themselves with oil;
24013	40	25	4	 but the wise, besides their  torches, took oil in their  flasks.
24014	40	25	5	 The bridegroom was a long time in coming, so that meanwhile they all became drowsy and fell asleep.
24015	40	25	6	 But at midnight there is a loud cry, "`The bridegroom! Go out and meet him!'
24016	40	25	7	 "Then all those bridesmaids roused themselves and trimmed their torches.
24017	40	25	8	 "`Give us some of your oil,' said the foolish ones to the wise, `for our torches are going out.'
24018	40	25	9	 "`But perhaps,' replied the wise, `there will not be enough for all of us. Go to the shops rather, and buy some for yourselves.'
24019	40	25	10	 "So they went to buy. But meanwhile the bridegroom came; those bridesmaids who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet; and the door was shut.
24020	40	25	11	 "Afterwards the other bridesmaids came and cried, "`Sir, Sir, open the door to us.'
24021	40	25	12	 "`In solemn truth I tell you,' he replied, `I do not know you.'
24022	40	25	13	 "Keep awake therefore; for you know neither the day nor the hour.
24023	40	25	14	  "Why, it is like a man who, when going on his travels, called his  bondservants and entrusted his property to their care.
24024	40	25	15	 To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one--to each according to his individual capacity; and then started from home.
24025	40	25	16	 Without delay the one who had received the five talents went and employed them in business, and gained five more.
24026	40	25	17	 In the same way he who had the two gained two more.
24027	40	25	18	 But the man who had received the one went and dug a hole and buried his  master's money.
24028	40	25	19	  "After a long lapse of time the master of those servants returned, and had a reckoning with them.
24029	40	25	20	 The one who had received the five talents came and brought five more, and said, "`Sir, it was five talents that you entrusted to me: see, I have gained five more.'
24030	40	25	21	 "`You have done well,  good and  trustworthy servant,' replied his master; `you have been trustworthy in the management of a little, I will put you in charge of much: share your master's joy.'
24031	40	25	22	 "The second, who had received the two talents, came and said, "`Sir, it was two talents you entrusted to me: see, I have gained two more.'
24032	40	25	23	 "`Good and trustworthy servant, you have done well,' his master replied; `you have been trustworthy in the management of a little, I will put you in charge of much:  share your master's joy.'
24033	40	25	24	 "But, next, the man who had the one talent in his keeping came and said, "`Sir,  I knew you to be a severe man, reaping where you had not sown and garnering  what you had not winnowed.
24034	40	25	25	 So being afraid I went and buried your talent in the ground: there you have what belongs to you.'
24035	40	25	26	 "`You wicked and slothful servant,' replied his master, `did you know that I reap where I have not sown, and garner what I have not winnowed?
24036	40	25	27	 Your duty then was to deposit my money in some bank, and so when I came I should have got back my property with interest.
24037	40	25	28	 So take away the talent from him, and give it to the man who has the ten.'
24038	40	25	29	 (For to every one who has, more shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but from him  who has nothing, even what he has shall be taken away.)
24039	40	25	30	 `But as for this worthless servant, put him out into the darkness outside: *there* will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.'
24040	40	25	31	  "When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then will He sit upon His glorious throne,
24041	40	25	32	 and  all the nations will be gathered into His presence. And He will separate  them from one another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats;
24042	40	25	33	 and will make the sheep stand at His right hand, and the goats at His left.
24043	40	25	34	 "Then the King will say to those at His right, "`Come, my Father's blessed ones, receive your inheritance of the Kingdom which has been  divinely intended for you ever since the creation of the world.
24044	40	25	35	 For when I was hungry, you gave me food; when I was thirsty, you gave me drink; when I was homeless, you gave me a welcome;
24045	40	25	36	 when I was ill-clad, you clothed me; when I was sick, you visited me; when I was in prison, you came to see me.'
24046	40	25	37	 "`When, Lord,' the righteous will reply, `did we see  Thee hungry, and feed Thee; or thirsty, and give Thee drink?
24047	40	25	38	 When did we see Thee homeless, and give Thee a welcome? or ill-clad, and clothe Thee?
24048	40	25	39	 When did we see Thee sick or in prison, and come to see Thee?'
24049	40	25	40	 "But the King will answer them, "`In solemn truth I tell you that in so far as you rendered such services to one of the humblest of these my brethren, you rendered them to myself.'
24050	40	25	41	 "Then will He say to those at His left, "`Begone from me, with the curse resting upon you, into the Fire  of the Ages, which has been  prepared for the Devil and his angels.
24051	40	25	42	 For when I was hungry, you gave me nothing to eat; when thirsty, you gave me nothing to drink;
24052	40	25	43	 when homeless, you gave me no welcome; ill-clad, you clothed me not; sick or in prison, you visited me not.'
24053	40	25	44	 "Then will they also answer, "`Lord, when did we see Thee hungry or thirsty or homeless or ill-clad or sick or in prison, and not come to serve Thee?'
24054	40	25	45	 "But he will reply, "`In solemn truth I tell you that in so far as you withheld such services from one of the humblest of these, you withheld them from me.'
24055	40	25	46	 "And these shall go away into the  Punishment  of the Ages, but the righteous into the Life  of the Ages."
24056	40	26	1	  When Jesus had ended all these discourses, He said to His disciples,
24057	40	26	2	 "You know that in  two days' time the Passover comes. And the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified."
24058	40	26	3	 Then the High Priests and Elders of the People assembled in the court of the palace of the High Priest Caiaphas,
24059	40	26	4	 and consulted how to get Jesus into their power by stratagem and put Him to death.
24060	40	26	5	 But they said, "Not during the Festival, lest there be a riot among the people."
24061	40	26	6	  Now when Jesus was come to Bethany and was at the house of Simon the Leper,
24062	40	26	7	  a woman came to Him with a jar of very costly, sweet-scented ointment, which she poured over His head as He reclined at table.
24063	40	26	8	 "Why such waste?" indignantly exclaimed the disciples;
24064	40	26	9	 "for this might have been sold for a considerable sum, and the money given to the poor."
24065	40	26	10	 But Jesus heard it, and said to them, "Why are you vexing her? For she has done a most gracious act towards me.
24066	40	26	11	 The poor you always have with you, but me you have not always.
24067	40	26	12	 In pouring this ointment over me, her object was to prepare me for burial.
24068	40	26	13	 In solemn truth I tell you that wherever in the whole world this Good News shall be proclaimed, this deed of hers shall be spoken of in memory of her."
24069	40	26	14	  At that time one of the Twelve, the one called Judas Iscariot, went to the High Priests
24070	40	26	15	 and said, "What are you willing to give me if I betray him to you?" So they weighed out to him thirty shekels,
24071	40	26	16	 and from that moment he was on the look out for an opportunity to betray Him.
24072	40	26	17	  On the first day of the Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus with the question, "Where shall we make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"
24073	40	26	18	 "Go into the city," He replied, "to a certain man, and tell him, `The Teacher says, My time is close at hand. It is at your house that I shall keep the Passover with my disciples.'"
24074	40	26	19	 The disciples did as Jesus directed them, and got the Passover ready.
24075	40	26	20	  When evening came, He  was at table with the twelve  disciples,
24076	40	26	21	  and the meal was proceeding, when Jesus said, "In solemn truth I tell you that one of you will betray me."
24077	40	26	22	 Intensely grieved they began one after another to ask Him, "Can it be I, Master?"
24078	40	26	23	 "The one who has dipped his fingers in the bowl with me," He answered, "is the man who will betray me.
24079	40	26	24	 The Son of Man is indeed going as is written concerning Him; but alas for that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It had been a happy thing for that man if he had  never been born."
24080	40	26	25	 Then Judas, the disciple who was betraying Him, asked, "Can it be I, Rabbi?"  "It is you," He replied.
24081	40	26	26	  During the meal Jesus took  a Passover biscuit, blessed it and broke it. He then gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take this and eat it: it  is my body."
24082	40	26	27	 And He  took the cup and gave thanks, and gave it to them saying, "Drink from it, all of you;
24083	40	26	28	 for this is my blood which is to be poured out for many for the remission of sins--the blood which ratifies  the Covenant.
24084	40	26	29	  I tell you that I will never again take the produce of the vine till that day when I shall drink  the new wine with you in my Father's Kingdom."
24085	40	26	30	  So they sang  the hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.
24086	40	26	31	  Then said Jesus, "This night all of you will stumble and fail in your fidelity to me; for it is written, <`I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered in all directions.'>
24087	40	26	32	 But after I have risen to life again I will go before you into Galilee."
24088	40	26	33	 "All may stumble and fail," said Peter, "but I never will."
24089	40	26	34	 "In solemn truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "that this very night,  before the cock crows, you will three times disown me."
24090	40	26	35	 "Even if I must die with you," declared Peter, "I will never disown you." In like manner protested all the disciples.
24091	40	26	36	  Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane. And He said to the disciples, "Sit down here, whilst I go yonder and there pray."
24092	40	26	37	 And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zabdi. Then He began to be full of anguish and distress,
24093	40	26	38	 and He said to them, "My soul is  crushed with anguish to the very point of death; wait here, and keep awake with me."
24094	40	26	39	 Going forward a short distance He fell on His face and prayed. "My Father," He said, "if it is possible, let this  cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou willest."
24095	40	26	40	 Then He came to the disciples and found them asleep, and He said to Peter, "Alas, none of you could keep awake with me for even a single hour!
24096	40	26	41	 Keep awake, and pray that you may not enter into temptation:  the spirit is  right willing, but the  body is frail."
24097	40	26	42	 Again a second time He went away and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is impossible for this cup to pass without my drinking it, Thy will be done."
24098	40	26	43	 He came and again found them asleep, for  they were very tired.
24099	40	26	44	 So He left them, and went away once more and prayed a third time, again using the same words.
24100	40	26	45	 Then He came to the disciples and said, "Sleep on and rest. See, the moment is close at hand when the Son of Man is to be betrayed into the hands of sinful men.
24101	40	26	46	 Rouse yourselves. Let us be going. My betrayer is close at hand."
24102	40	26	47	  He had scarcely finished speaking when Judas came--one of the Twelve--accompanied by a great crowd of men armed with swords and bludgeons, sent by the High Priests and Elders of the People.
24103	40	26	48	 Now the betrayer had agreed upon a sign with them, to direct them. He had said, "The one whom I kiss is the man: lay hold of him."
24104	40	26	49	 So he went straight to Jesus and said,  "Peace to you, Rabbi!" And he kissed Him  eagerly.
24105	40	26	50	 "Friend," said Jesus,  "carry out your intention." Then they came and laid their hands on Jesus and seized Him firmly.
24106	40	26	51	 But one of those with Jesus drew his sword and struck the High Priest's  servant, cutting off his ear.
24107	40	26	52	 "Put back your sword again," said Jesus, "for all who  draw the sword shall perish by the sword.
24108	40	26	53	 Or do you suppose I cannot entreat my Father and He would instantly  send to my help more than twelve legions of angels?
24109	40	26	54	 In that case how are the Scriptures to be fulfilled which declare that thus it must be?"
24110	40	26	55	 Then said Jesus to the crowds, "Have you come out as if to fight with a robber, with swords and bludgeons to apprehend me? Day after day I  have been sitting teaching in the Temple, and you did not arrest me.
24111	40	26	56	  But all this has taken place in order that the writings of the Prophets may be fulfilled." At this point the disciples all left Him and fled.
24112	40	26	57	  But the officers who had laid hold of Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the High Priest, at whose house the Scribes and the Elders had assembled.
24113	40	26	58	 And Peter kept following Him at a distance, till he came even to the court of the High Priest's palace, where he entered and sat down among the  officers to see the issue.
24114	40	26	59	 Meanwhile the High Priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking false testimony against Jesus in order to put Him to death;
24115	40	26	60	 but they could find none, although many false witnesses came forward. At length there came two
24116	40	26	61	 who testified, "This man said, `I am able to pull down the Sanctuary of God and three days afterwards to build a new one.'"
24117	40	26	62	 Then the High Priest stood up and asked Him, "Have you no answer to make? What is it these men are saying in evidence against you?"
24118	40	26	63	 Jesus however remained silent. Again the High Priest addressed Him. "In the name of the  ever-living God," he said,  "I now put you on your oath. Tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God."
24119	40	26	64	  "I am He," replied Jesus. "But I tell you that,  later on, you will see <the Son of Man sitting at the right hand> of Omnipotence, <and coming on the clouds of the sky.">
24120	40	26	65	 Then the High Priest tore his robes and exclaimed, "Impious language! What further need have we of witnesses! See, you have now heard the impiety.
24121	40	26	66	 What is your verdict?" "He deserves to die," they replied.
24122	40	26	67	 Then they spat in His face, and struck Him--some with the fist, some  with the open hand--
24123	40	26	68	 while they taunted Him, saying, "Christ,  prove yourself a Prophet by telling us who it was that struck you."
24124	40	26	69	 Peter meanwhile was sitting outside in the court of the palace, when  one of the maidservants came over to him and said, "You too were with Jesus the Galilaean."
24125	40	26	70	 He denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you mean."
24126	40	26	71	 Soon afterwards he went out and stood in the gateway, when another girl saw him, and said, addressing the people there,  "This man was with Jesus the Nazarene."
24127	40	26	72	 Again he denied it with an oath. "I do not know the man," he said.
24128	40	26	73	 A short time afterwards the people  standing there came and said to Peter, "Certainly you too are one of them, for your brogue shows it."
24129	40	26	74	 Then with curses and oaths he declared, "I do not know the man." Immediately a cock crowed,
24130	40	26	75	 and Peter recollected the words of Jesus, how He had said, "Before the cock crows you will three times disown me." And he went out and wept  aloud, bitterly.
24131	40	27	1	  When morning came all the High Priests and the Elders of the people consulted together against Jesus to put Him to death;
24132	40	27	2	 and binding Him they led Him away and handed Him over to Pilate the Governor.
24133	40	27	3	  Then when Judas,  who had betrayed Him, saw that He was condemned, smitten with remorse he brought back the thirty shekels to the High Priests and Elders
24134	40	27	4	 and said, "I have sinned, in betraying to death one who is innocent." "What does that matter to us?" they replied; it is your business."
24135	40	27	5	 Flinging the shekels into the Sanctuary he left the place, and went and hanged himself.
24136	40	27	6	 When the High Priests had gathered up the money they said, "It is illegal to put it into the Treasury, because it is the price of blood."
24137	40	27	7	 So after consulting together they spent the money in the purchase of the Potter's Field as a burial place for people not belonging to the city;
24138	40	27	8	 for which reason that piece of ground received the name, which it still bears, of `the Field of Blood.'
24139	40	27	9	 Then were fulfilled the words spoken by the Prophet Jeremiah, <"And I took the thirty shekels, the price of the prized one on whom Israelites had set a price,
24140	40	27	10	 and  gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me.">
24141	40	27	11	  Meanwhile Jesus was brought before the Governor, and the latter put the question, "Are you the King of the Jews?"  "I am their King," He answered.
24142	40	27	12	 When however the High Priests and the Elders kept bringing their charges against Him, He said not a word in reply.
24143	40	27	13	 "Do you not hear," asked Pilate, "what a mass of  evidence they are bringing against you?"
24144	40	27	14	 But He made no reply to a single accusation, so that the Governor was greatly astonished.
24145	40	27	15	  "Now it was the Governor's custom at the Festival to release some one prisoner, whomsoever the populace desired;
24146	40	27	16	 and at this time they had a notorious prisoner called  Barabbas.
24147	40	27	17	 So when they were now assembled Pilate appealed to them. "Whom shall I release to you," he said,  "Barabbas, or Jesus the so-called Christ?"
24148	40	27	18	 For he knew that it was from envious hatred that Jesus had been brought before him.
24149	40	27	19	 While he was sitting on the tribunal a message came to him from his wife. "Have nothing to do with that innocent man," she said, "for during the night I have suffered terribly in a dream through him."
24150	40	27	20	 The High Priests, however, and the Elders  urged the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to demand the death of Jesus.
24151	40	27	21	 So when the Governor  a second time asked them, "Which of the two shall I release to you?" --they cried, "Barabbas!"
24152	40	27	22	 "What then," said Pilate, "shall I do with Jesus, the so-called Christ?" With one voice they shouted, "Let him be crucified!"
24153	40	27	23	 "Why, what crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they kept on furiously shouting, "Let him be crucified!"
24154	40	27	24	  So when he saw that he could gain nothing, but that on the contrary there was a riot threatening, he called for water and washed his hands in sight of them all, saying, "I am  not responsible for this murder: you must answer for it."
24155	40	27	25	 "His blood," replied all the people, "be on us and on our children!"
24156	40	27	26	 Then he released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he ordered to be  scourged, and gave Him up to be crucified.
24157	40	27	27	 Then the Governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and called together the whole  battalion  to make sport of Him.
24158	40	27	28	 Stripping off His garments, they put on Him a general's short  crimson cloak.
24159	40	27	29	 They twisted a wreath of thorny twigs and put it on His head, and they put a sceptre of cane in His right hand, and kneeling to Him they shouted in mockery,  "Long live the King of the Jews!"
24160	40	27	30	 Then they spat upon Him, and taking the cane they repeatedly struck Him on the head with it.
24161	40	27	31	  At last, having finished their sport, they took off the cloak, clothed Him again in His own garments, and led Him away for crucifixion.
24162	40	27	32	 Going out they met a Cyrenaean named Simon; whom they compelled to carry His cross,
24163	40	27	33	 and so they came to a place called Golgotha, which means `Skull-ground.'
24164	40	27	34	 Here they gave Him a mixture of  wine and gall to drink, but having tasted it He refused to drink it.
24165	40	27	35	  After crucifying Him, they divided His garments among them by lot,
24166	40	27	36	 and sat down there on guard.
24167	40	27	37	 Over His head they placed a written statement of the charge against Him: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
24168	40	27	38	 At the same time two robbers were crucified with Him, one at His right hand and the other at His left.
24169	40	27	39	  And the passers-by reviled Him. They shook their heads at Him
24170	40	27	40	 and said, "You who would pull down the Sanctuary and build a new one within three days, save yourself. If you are God's Son, come down from the cross."
24171	40	27	41	 In like manner the High Priests also, together with the Scribes and the Elders, taunted Him.
24172	40	27	42	 "He saved others," they said,  "himself he cannot save! He is the King of Israel! Let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in him.
24173	40	27	43	 His trust is in God: let God deliver him now, if He will have him; for he said, `I am God's Son.'"
24174	40	27	44	 Insults of the same kind were heaped on Him even by the  robbers who were being crucified with Him.
24175	40	27	45	  Now from noon until three o'clock in the afternoon there was darkness over the whole  land;
24176	40	27	46	 but about three o'clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice, <"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?"> that is to say, <"My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken me?">
24177	40	27	47	  "The man is calling for Elijah," said some of the bystanders.
24178	40	27	48	 One of them ran forthwith, and filling a sponge with  sour wine put it on the end of a cane and offered it Him to drink;
24179	40	27	49	 while the rest said, "Let us see whether Elijah is coming to deliver him."
24180	40	27	50	 But Jesus uttered another loud cry and then yielded up His spirit.
24181	40	27	51	  Immediately the curtain of the Sanctuary  was torn in two  from top to bottom: the earth quaked; the rocks split;
24182	40	27	52	 the tombs opened; and many of God's people who were asleep in death  awoke.
24183	40	27	53	 And coming out of their tombs after Christ's resurrection they entered the holy city and showed themselves to many.
24184	40	27	54	 As for the Captain and the soldiers who were with Him keeping guard over Jesus, when they witnessed the earthquake and the other occurrences they were filled with terror, and exclaimed, "Assuredly he was God's Son."
24185	40	27	55	 And there were a number of women there looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee ministering to His necessities;
24186	40	27	56	 among them being Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James and  Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zabdi.
24187	40	27	57	  Towards sunset there came a wealthy inhabitant of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself also had become a disciple of Jesus.
24188	40	27	58	 He went to Pilate and begged to have the body of Jesus, and Pilate ordered it to be given to him.
24189	40	27	59	 So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean sheet of fine linen.
24190	40	27	60	 He then laid it in his own  new tomb which he had hewn in the solid rock, and after rolling a great stone against the door of the tomb he went home.
24191	40	27	61	 Mary of Magdala and the other Mary were both present there, sitting opposite to the sepulchre.
24192	40	27	62	 On the next day, the day after the Preparation, the High Priests and the Pharisees came in a body to Pilate.
24193	40	27	63	 "Sir," they said, "we recollect that during his lifetime that impostor pretended that after two days he was to rise to life again.
24194	40	27	64	 So give orders for the sepulchre to be securely guarded till the third day, for fear his disciples should come by night and steal  the body, and then tell the people that he has come back to life; and so the last imposture will be more serious than the first."
24195	40	27	65	  "You can have a guard," said Pilate: "go and make all safe, as best you can."
24196	40	27	66	 So they went and made the sepulchre secure, sealing the stone besides setting the guard.
24197	40	28	1	  After the Sabbath, in the early dawn of the first day of the week, Mary of Magdala and the other Mary came to see the sepulchre.
24198	40	28	2	 But to their amazement there  had been a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord had descended from Heaven, and had come and rolled back the stone, and was sitting upon it.
24199	40	28	3	 His appearance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow.
24200	40	28	4	 For fear of him the guards trembled violently, and became like dead men.
24201	40	28	5	  But the angel said to the women, "As for you,  dismiss your fears. I know that it is Jesus that you are looking for--the crucified One.
24202	40	28	6	 He is not here: He has  come back to life, as He foretold. Come and see the place  where He lay.
24203	40	28	7	 And go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead and is going before you into Galilee: there you shall see Him. Remember, I have told you."
24204	40	28	8	  They quickly left the tomb and ran, still terrified but full of unspeakable joy, to carry the news to His disciples.
24205	40	28	9	  And then suddenly they saw Jesus coming to meet them. "Peace be to you," He said. And they came and clasped His feet,  bowing to the ground before Him.
24206	40	28	10	 Then He said, "Dismiss all fear! Go and take word to my brethren to go into Galilee, and there they shall see me."
24207	40	28	11	 While they went on this errand, some of the guards came into the city and reported to the High Priests every detail of what had happened.
24208	40	28	12	 So the latter held a conference with the Elders, and after consultation with them they heavily bribed the soldiers,
24209	40	28	13	 telling them to say, "His disciples came during the night and stole  his body while we were asleep."
24210	40	28	14	 "And if this," they added,  "is reported to the Governor, we will satisfy him and screen you from punishment."
24211	40	28	15	 So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this story was noised about among the Jews, and is current to this day.
24212	40	28	16	  As for the eleven disciples, they proceeded into Galilee, to the hill where Jesus had arranged to meet them.
24213	40	28	17	 There they saw Him and  prostrated themselves before Him. Yet some doubted.
24214	40	28	18	 Jesus however came near and said to them, "All  power in Heaven and  over the earth has been given to me.
24215	40	28	19	 Go  therefore and make disciples of all the nations; baptize them  into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;
24216	40	28	20	 and teach them to obey every command which I have given you. And remember, I am with you always, day by day, until the  Close of the  Age."
24217	41	1	1	  The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ  the Son of God.
24218	41	1	2	 As  it is written in Isaiah the Prophet, <"See, I am sending My messenger before Thee, Who will prepare Thy way";
24219	41	1	3	 "The voice of one  crying aloud: `In the Desert prepare a road for the Lord: Make His highways straight.'">
24220	41	1	4	 So John  the Baptizer came, and was in the Desert proclaiming a baptism of  the penitent for forgiveness of sins.
24221	41	1	5	 There went out to him people  of all classes from Judaea, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem of all ranks, and  were baptized by him  in the river Jordan, making open confession of their sins.
24222	41	1	6	 As for John, his garment was of camel's hair, and he wore a loincloth of leather; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
24223	41	1	7	  His announcement was, "There is One coming after me mightier than I--One whose sandal-strap I am unworthy to stoop down and unfasten.
24224	41	1	8	 I have baptized you with water, but He will baptize you  with the Holy Spirit."
24225	41	1	9	  At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan;
24226	41	1	10	 and  immediately on His coming up out of the water He saw an opening in the sky, and the Spirit like a  dove coming down  to Him;
24227	41	1	11	 and a voice came from the sky, saying, "Thou art My Son dearly loved: in Thee is My delight."
24228	41	1	12	  At once the Spirit impelled Him to go out into the Desert,
24229	41	1	13	 where He remained for forty days, tempted by Satan; and He was among the wild beasts, but the angels waited upon Him.
24230	41	1	14	  Then, after John had been  thrown into prison, Jesus came into Galilee proclaiming God's Good News.
24231	41	1	15	 "The time has fully come," He said, "and the Kingdom of God is close at hand: repent, and believe this Good News.
24232	41	1	16	 One day, passing along the shore of the Lake of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew, Simon's brother, throwing their nets in the Lake; for they were fisherman.
24233	41	1	17	 "Come and follow me," said Jesus, "and I will make you fishers for men."
24234	41	1	18	 At once they left their nets and followed Him.
24235	41	1	19	 Going on a little further He saw James the son of Zabdi and his brother John: they also were in the boat mending the nets, and He immediately called them.
24236	41	1	20	 They  therefore left their father Zabdi in the boat with the hired men, and went and followed Him.
24237	41	1	21	  So they came to Capernaum, and on the next Sabbath He went to the synagogue and began to teach.
24238	41	1	22	 The people listened with amazement to His teaching--for there was authority about it: it was very different from that of the Scribes--
24239	41	1	23	 when all at once, there in their synagogue, a man  under the power of a foul spirit screamed out:
24240	41	1	24	 "What have you to do with us, Jesus the Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--God's Holy One."
24241	41	1	25	 But Jesus reprimanded him, saying, "Silence! come out of him."
24242	41	1	26	 So the foul spirit, after throwing the man into convulsions, came out of him with a loud cry.
24243	41	1	27	 And all were  amazed and awe-struck, so they began to ask one another, "What does this mean? Here is a new sort of teaching--and a tone of authority! And even to foul spirits he issues orders and they obey him!"
24244	41	1	28	 And His fame spread at once everywhere in all that part of Galilee.
24245	41	1	29	  Then on leaving the synagogue  they came at once, with James and John, to the house of Simon and Andrew.
24246	41	1	30	 Now Simon's mother-in-law was ill in bed with a fever, and without delay they informed Him about her.
24247	41	1	31	 So He went to her, and taking her  hand He raised her to her feet: the fever left her, and she began to wait upon them.
24248	41	1	32	 When it was evening, after sunset people came bringing Him all who were sick and the demoniacs;
24249	41	1	33	 and the whole town was assembled at the door.
24250	41	1	34	 Then He cured numbers of people who were ill with various diseases, and He drove out many demons; not allowing the demons to speak, because they knew  who He was.
24251	41	1	35	 In the morning He rose early, while it was still quite dark, and leaving the house He went away to a solitary place and there prayed.
24252	41	1	36	 And Simon and the others searched everywhere for Him.
24253	41	1	37	 When they found Him they said, "Every one is looking for you."
24254	41	1	38	 "Let us go elsewhere, to the neighbouring country towns," He replied, "that I may proclaim my Message there also; because for that purpose I came from God."
24255	41	1	39	 And He went through all Galilee, preaching in the synagogues and expelling the demons.
24256	41	1	40	 One day there came a leper to Jesus entreating Him, and pleading on his knees. "If you are willing," he said, "you are able to cleanse me."
24257	41	1	41	  Moved with pity Jesus reached out His hand and touched him. "I am willing," He said; "be cleansed."
24258	41	1	42	 The leprosy at once  left him, and he was cleansed.
24259	41	1	43	 Jesus at once sent him away, strictly charging him,
24260	41	1	44	 and saying, "Be careful not to tell any one, but go and show yourself to the Priest, and for your purification present the offerings that Moses appointed as evidence for them."
24261	41	1	45	 But the man, when he went out, began to tell every one and to publish the matter abroad, so that it was no longer possible for Jesus to go openly into  any town; but He had to remain outside in unfrequented places, where people came to Him from all parts.
24262	41	2	1	  After some days He entered Capernaum again, and it soon became known that He was at home;
24263	41	2	2	 and such numbers of people came together that there was no longer room for them even round the door. He was speaking His Message to them,
24264	41	2	3	 when there came a party of people bringing a paralytic--four men carrying him.
24265	41	2	4	 Finding themselves unable, however, to bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they untiled the roof just over His head, and after clearing an opening they lowered the mat on which the paralytic was lying.
24266	41	2	5	 Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, "My son, your sins are pardoned."
24267	41	2	6	 Now there were some of the Scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts.
24268	41	2	7	 "Why does this man use such words?" they said; "he is blaspheming. Who can pardon sins but One--that is, God?"
24269	41	2	8	 At once perceiving by His spirit that they were reasoning within themselves, Jesus asked them, "Why do you thus argue in your  minds?
24270	41	2	9	 Which is easier?--to say to this paralytic, `Your sins are pardoned,' or to say, `Rise, take up your mat, and walk?'
24271	41	2	10	 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to pardon sins" --He turned to the paralytic, and said,
24272	41	2	11	 "To you I say, `Rise, take up your mat and go home.'"
24273	41	2	12	 The man rose, and immediately under the eyes of all took up his mat and went out, so that they were all filled with astonishment, gave the glory to God, and said, "We never saw anything like this."
24274	41	2	13	  Again He went out to the shore of the Lake, and the whole multitude kept coming to Him, and He taught them.
24275	41	2	14	 And as He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting  at the Toll Office, and said to him, "Follow me." So he rose and followed Him.
24276	41	2	15	 When He was  sitting at table in Levi's house, a large number of tax-gatherers and notorious sinners were at table with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many such who habitually followed Him.
24277	41	2	16	 But when the Scribes of the Pharisee sect saw Him eating with the sinners and the tax-gatherers, they said to His disciples, "He is eating  and drinking with the tax-gatherers and sinners!"
24278	41	2	17	 Jesus heard the words, and He said, "It is not the healthy who require a doctor, but the sick: I did not come to appeal to the righteous, but to sinners."
24279	41	2	18	  (Now John's disciples and those of the Pharisees were  keeping a fast.) And they came and asked Him, "How is it that John's disciples and those of the Pharisees are fasting, and yours are not?"
24280	41	2	19	 "Can a wedding party fast while the bridegroom is among them?" replied Jesus. "So long as they have the bridegroom with them, fasting is impossible.
24281	41	2	20	 But a time will come when the Bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast.
24282	41	2	21	 No one mends an old garment with a piece of unshrunk cloth. Otherwise, the patch put on would tear away from it--the new from the old--and a worse hole would be made.
24283	41	2	22	 And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise the wine would burst the skins, and both wine and skins would be lost. New wine needs fresh skins!"
24284	41	2	23	  One Sabbath He was walking through the wheatfields when His disciples began to pluck the ears of wheat as they went.
24285	41	2	24	 So the Pharisees said to Him, "Look! why are they doing what on the Sabbath is unlawful?"
24286	41	2	25	 "Have you never read," Jesus replied, "what David did when the necessity arose and he and his men were hungry:
24287	41	2	26	 how he entered the house of God  in the High-priesthood of Abiathar, and ate the Presented Loaves--which none but the priests are allowed to eat--and gave some to his men also?"
24288	41	2	27	 And Jesus said to them: "The Sabbath was made for  man, not man for the Sabbath;
24289	41	2	28	 so that the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."
24290	41	3	1	  At another time, when He went to the synagogue, there was a man there with one arm shrivelled up.
24291	41	3	2	 They closely watched Him to see whether He would cure him on the Sabbath--so as to have a charge to bring against Him.
24292	41	3	3	 "Come forward," said He to the man with the shrivelled arm.
24293	41	3	4	 Then He asked them, "Are we allowed to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil? to save a  life, or to destroy one?" They remained silent.
24294	41	3	5	  Grieved and indignant at the hardening of their hearts, He looked round on them with anger, and said to the man, "Stretch out your arm." He stretched it out, and the arm was completely restored.
24295	41	3	6	 But no sooner had the Pharisees left the synagogue than they held a consultation with the Herodians against Jesus, to devise some means of destroying Him.
24296	41	3	7	  Accordingly Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the Lake, and a vast crowd of people from Galilee followed Him;
24297	41	3	8	 and from Judaea and Jerusalem and Idumaea and from beyond the Jordan and from the district of Tyre and Sidon there came to Him a vast crowd, hearing of all that He was doing.
24298	41	3	9	  So He gave directions to His disciples to keep a small boat in constant attendance on Him because of the throng--to prevent their crushing Him.
24299	41	3	10	 For He had cured many of the people, so that all who had any ailments pressed upon Him, to touch Him.
24300	41	3	11	 And the foul spirits, whenever they saw Him, threw themselves down at His feet, screaming out: "You are the Son of God."
24301	41	3	12	 But He many a time checked them, forbidding them to say who He was.
24302	41	3	13	  Then He went up the hill; and those whom He Himself chose He called, and they came to Him.
24303	41	3	14	 He appointed  twelve of them, that they might be with Him, and that He might also send them to proclaim His Message,
24304	41	3	15	 with authority to expel the demons.
24305	41	3	16	  These twelve were Simon (to whom He gave the surname of Peter),
24306	41	3	17	 James the son of Zabdi and John the brother of James (these two He surnamed Boanerges, that is `Sons of Thunder'),
24307	41	3	18	 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the  Cananaean,
24308	41	3	19	 and Judas Iscariot, the man who also betrayed Him.
24309	41	3	20	  And He  went into a house. But again the crowd assembled, so that there was no opportunity for them even  to snatch a meal.
24310	41	3	21	 Hearing of this,  His relatives came to seize Him by force, for they said, "He is out of his mind."
24311	41	3	22	 The Scribes, too, who had come down from Jerusalem said, "He has  Baal-zebul in him; and it is by the power of the Prince of the demons that he expels the demons."
24312	41	3	23	 So He called them to Him, and using figurative language He appealed to them, saying, "How is it possible for Satan to expel Satan?
24313	41	3	24	  For if civil war breaks out in a kingdom, nothing can make that kingdom last;
24314	41	3	25	 and if a family splits into parties, that family cannot continue.
24315	41	3	26	 So if Satan has risen in arms and has made war upon himself, stand he cannot, but meets his end.
24316	41	3	27	 Nay, no one can go into a strong man's house and carry off his property, unless he first binds the strong man, and then he will plunder his house.
24317	41	3	28	  In solemn truth I tell you that all their sins may be pardoned to the sons of men, and all their blasphemies, however they may have blasphemed;
24318	41	3	29	 but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, he remains  for ever unabsolved: he is guilty of  a sin  of the Ages."
24319	41	3	30	 This was because they said, "He is possessed by a foul spirit."
24320	41	3	31	  By this time His mother and His brothers arrive, and standing  outside they send a message to Him to call Him.
24321	41	3	32	 Now a crowd was  sitting round Him; so they tell Him, "Your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside, inquiring for you."
24322	41	3	33	 "Who are my mother and my brothers?" He replied.
24323	41	3	34	 And, fixing His eyes on the people who were sitting round Him in a circle, He said,
24324	41	3	35	 "Here are my mother and my brothers. For wherever there is one who has been obedient to God, there is my brother--my sister--and my mother."
24325	41	4	1	  Once more He began to teach by the side of the Lake, and a vast multitude of people came together to listen to Him. He therefore went  on board the boat and sat there, a little way from the land; and all the people were on the shore close to the water.
24326	41	4	2	 Then He proceeded to teach them many lessons in figurative language; and in His teaching He said,
24327	41	4	3	 "Listen: the sower  goes out to sow.
24328	41	4	4	 As he sows, some of the seed falls by the way-side, and the birds come and peck it up.
24329	41	4	5	 Some falls on the rocky ground where it finds but little earth, and it shoots up quickly because it has no depth of soil;
24330	41	4	6	 but when the sun is risen, it is scorched, and through having no root it withers away.
24331	41	4	7	 Some, again, falls among the thorns; and the thorns spring up and stifle it, so that it yields no crop.
24332	41	4	8	 But some of the seed falls into good ground, and gives a return: it comes up and increases, and yields thirty, sixty, or a hundred-fold."
24333	41	4	9	 "Listen," He added, "every one who has ears to listen with!"
24334	41	4	10	 When He was alone, the Twelve and the others who were about Him requested Him to explain His figurative language.
24335	41	4	11	 "To you," He replied, "has been entrusted  the secret truth concerning the Kingdom of God; but to those others outside your number all this is spoken in figurative language;
24336	41	4	12	 that <"`They may look and look but not see, and listen and listen but not understand, lest perchance they should return and be pardoned.'">
24337	41	4	13	 "Do you all miss the meaning of this parable?" He added; "how then will you understand the rest of my parables?"
24338	41	4	14	 "What the sower sows is the Message.
24339	41	4	15	 Those who receive the seed by the way-side are those in whom the Message is sown, but, when they have heard it, Satan comes at once and carries away the Message sown in them.
24340	41	4	16	 In the same way those who  receive the seed on the rocky places are those who, when they have heard the Message, at once accept it joyfully,
24341	41	4	17	 but they have no root within them. They last for a time; then, when suffering or persecution comes because of the Message, they  are immediately overthrown.
24342	41	4	18	 Others there are who  receive the seed among the thorns: these are they who have heard the Message,
24343	41	4	19	 but worldly cares and the deceitfulness of wealth and the excessive pursuit of other objects come in and stifle the Message, and it becomes unfruitful.
24344	41	4	20	 Those, on the other hand, who  have received the seed on the good ground, are all who hear the Message and welcome it, and yield a return of thirty, sixty, or a hundred fold."
24345	41	4	21	 He went on to say, "Is the lamp brought in in order to be put under the  bushel or under the bed? Is it not rather in order that it may be placed on the lampstand?
24346	41	4	22	  Why, there is nothing hidden except with a view to its being ultimately disclosed, nor has anything been made a secret but that it may at last come to light.
24347	41	4	23	 Listen, every one who has ears to listen with!"
24348	41	4	24	 He also said to them, "Take care what you hear. With what measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and that with interest.
24349	41	4	25	 For those who have will have more given them; and from those who have not, even what they have will be taken away."
24350	41	4	26	 Another saying of His was this: "The Kingdom of God is as if a man scattered seed over the ground:
24351	41	4	27	 he spends days and nights, now awake, now asleep, while the seed sprouts and grows tall, he knows not how.
24352	41	4	28	 Of itself the land produces the crop--  first the blade, then the ear; afterwards the perfect grain is seen in the ear.
24353	41	4	29	 But no sooner is the crop ripe, than he sends the  reapers, because the time of harvest has come."
24354	41	4	30	  Another saying of His was this: "How are we to picture the Kingdom of God? or by what figure of speech shall we represent it?
24355	41	4	31	 It is like a mustard-seed, which, when sown in the earth, is the smallest of all the seeds in the world;
24356	41	4	32	 yet when sown it springs up and becomes larger than all the  herbs, and throws out great branches, so that the birds build under its shadow."
24357	41	4	33	 With many such parables He used to speak the Message to them according to their capacity for receiving it.
24358	41	4	34	 But except in figurative language He spoke nothing to them; while to His own disciples He expounded everything, in private.
24359	41	4	35	  The same day, in the evening, He said to them, "Let us cross to the other side."
24360	41	4	36	 So they got away from the crowd, and took Him--as He was--in the boat; and other boats accompanied Him.
24361	41	4	37	 But a heavy squall came on, and the waves were now dashing into the boat, so that it was fast filling.
24362	41	4	38	 But He Himself was in the stern asleep, with His head on the cushion: so they woke Him.  "Rabbi," they cried, "is it nothing to you that we are drowning?"
24363	41	4	39	 So He roused Himself and rebuked the wind, and said to the waves, "Silence! Be still!" The wind sank, and a perfect calm set in.
24364	41	4	40	 "Why are you so timid?" He asked; "have you still no faith?"
24365	41	4	41	 Then they were filled with terror, and began to say to one another, "Who is this, then? For even wind and sea obey Him."
24366	41	5	1	  So they arrived at the opposite shore of the Lake, in the country of the Gerasenes.
24367	41	5	2	 At once, on His landing, there came from the tombs to meet Him a man  possessed by a foul spirit.
24368	41	5	3	 This man lived  among the tombs, nor could any one now secure him even with a chain;
24369	41	5	4	 for many a time he had been left securely bound in fetters and chains, but afterwards the chains lay torn link from link, and the fetters in fragments, and there was no one strong enough to master him.
24370	41	5	5	 And constantly, day and night, he remained among the tombs or on the hills, shrieking, and mangling himself with sharp stones.
24371	41	5	6	 And when he saw Jesus in the distance, he ran and threw himself at His feet,
24372	41	5	7	 crying out in a loud voice, "What hast Thou to do with me, Jesus, Son of God Most High? In God's name I implore Thee not to torment me."
24373	41	5	8	 For He  had said to him, "Foul spirit, come out of the man."
24374	41	5	9	 Jesus also questioned him. "What is your name?" He said. "Legion," he replied, "for there are a host of us."
24375	41	5	10	 And  he earnestly entreated Him not to send them away out of the country.
24376	41	5	11	 Feeding there, on the mountain slope, was a great herd of swine.
24377	41	5	12	 So they besought Jesus. "Send us to the swine," they said, "so that we may enter into them."
24378	41	5	13	 He gave them leave; and the foul spirits came out and entered into the swine, and the herd--about 2,000 in number--rushed headlong down the cliff into the Lake and were drowned in the Lake.
24379	41	5	14	 The swineherds fled, and spread the news in town and country. So the people came to see what it was that had happened;
24380	41	5	15	 and when they came to Jesus, they beheld the demoniac quietly seated, clothed and of sane mind--the man who had had the legion; and they were awe-stricken.
24381	41	5	16	 And those who had seen it told them the particulars of what had happened to the demoniac, and all about the swine.
24382	41	5	17	 Then they began entreating Him to depart from their district.
24383	41	5	18	 As He was embarking, the man who had been possessed asked permission to accompany Him.
24384	41	5	19	 But He would not allow it. "Go home to your family," He said, "and report to them all that the Lord has done for you, and the mercy He has shown you."
24385	41	5	20	 So the man departed, and related publicly everywhere in the Ten Towns all that Jesus had done for him; and all were astonished.
24386	41	5	21	  When Jesus had re-crossed in the boat to the other side, a vast multitude came crowding to Him; and He was on the shore of the Lake,
24387	41	5	22	 when there came one of the Wardens of the Synagogue--he was called  Jair--who, on beholding Him, threw himself at His feet,
24388	41	5	23	 and besought Him with many entreaties. "My little daughter," he said, "is at the point of death: I pray you come and lay your hands upon her, that she may recover and live."
24389	41	5	24	 And Jesus went with him. And a dense crowd followed Him, and thronged Him on all sides.
24390	41	5	25	 Now a woman who for twelve years had suffered from haemorrhage,
24391	41	5	26	 and had undergone many different treatments under a number of doctors and had spent all she had without receiving benefit but on the contrary growing worse,
24392	41	5	27	 heard of Jesus. And she came in the crowd behind Him and touched His cloak;
24393	41	5	28	 for she said, "If I but touch His clothes, I shall be cured."
24394	41	5	29	 In a moment the  flow of her blood ceased, and she felt in herself that her complaint was cured.
24395	41	5	30	 Immediately Jesus, well knowing that healing power had gone  from within Him, turned round in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"
24396	41	5	31	 "You see the multitude pressing you on all sides," His disciples exclaimed, "and yet you ask, `Who touched me?'"
24397	41	5	32	 But He continued looking about to see the person who had done this,
24398	41	5	33	 until the woman, frightened and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and threw herself at His feet, and told Him all the truth.
24399	41	5	34	 "Daughter," He said, "your faith has cured you: go in peace, and be free from your complaint."
24400	41	5	35	 While He is yet speaking, men come from the house to the Warden, and say, "Your daughter  is dead: why trouble the  Rabbi further?"
24401	41	5	36	 But Jesus,  overhearing the words, said to the Warden, "Do not be afraid; only have faith."
24402	41	5	37	 And He allowed no one to accompany Him except Peter and the brothers James and John.
24403	41	5	38	 So they come to the Warden's house. Here He gazes on a scene of uproar, with people  weeping aloud and wailing.
24404	41	5	39	 He goes in. "Why all this outcry and loud weeping?" He asks; "the child is asleep, not dead."
24405	41	5	40	 To this their reply is a scornful laugh. He, however, puts them all out, takes the child's father and mother and those He has brought with Him, and enters the room where the child lies.
24406	41	5	41	 Then, taking her by the hand, He says to her, "Talitha, koum;" that is to say, "Little girl, I command you to wake!"
24407	41	5	42	 Instantly the little girl rises to her feet and begins to walk (for she was twelve years old). They were  at once beside themselves with utter astonishment;
24408	41	5	43	 but He gave strict injunctions that the matter should not be made known, and directed them to give her something to eat.
24409	41	6	1	  Leaving that place He came into His  own country, accompanied by His disciples.
24410	41	6	2	 On the Sabbath He proceeded to teach in the synagogue; and many, as they heard Him, were astonished. "Where did he acquire all this?" they asked. "What is this wisdom that has been given to him? And what are  these marvellous miracles which his hands perform?
24411	41	6	3	 Is not this the carpenter, Mary's son, the brother of James and Joses, Jude and Simon? And do not his sisters live here among us?" So they turned angrily away.
24412	41	6	4	 But Jesus said to them, "There is no Prophet without honour except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own home."
24413	41	6	5	 And He could not do any miracle there, except that He laid His hands on a few who were out of health and cured them; and
24414	41	6	6	 He wondered at their unbelief.  So He went round the adjacent villages, teaching.
24415	41	6	7	  Then summoning the Twelve to Him, He proceeded to send them out by twos, and gave them authority over the foul spirits.
24416	41	6	8	 He charged them to take nothing  for the journey except a stick; no bread, no bag, and  not a penny in their  pockets,
24417	41	6	9	 but to go wearing  sandals. "And do not," He said, "put on an extra under garment.
24418	41	6	10	 Wherever you enter a house, make it your home till you leave that place.
24419	41	6	11	 But wherever they will not receive you or listen to you, when you leave shake off the very dust from under your feet to bear witness concerning them."
24420	41	6	12	 So they set out, and preached in order that men might repent.
24421	41	6	13	 Many demons they expelled, and many invalids they anointed with oil and cured.
24422	41	6	14	  King Herod heard of all this (for the name of Jesus had become widely known), and  he kept saying, "John  the Baptizer  has come back to life, and that is why  these miraculous Powers are working in him."
24423	41	6	15	 Others asserted that He was Elijah. Others again said, "He is a Prophet, like one of the great Prophets."
24424	41	6	16	 But when Herod heard of Him, he said, "The John, whom I beheaded,  has come back to life."
24425	41	6	17	  For  Herod himself had sent and had had John arrested and had kept him in prison in chains, for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; because he had married her.
24426	41	6	18	 For John had repeatedly told Herod, "You have no right to be living with your brother's wife."
24427	41	6	19	 Therefore Herodias  hated him and wished to take his life, but could not;
24428	41	6	20	 for Herod  stood in awe of John, knowing him to be an upright and holy man, and he protected him. After listening to him he  was in great perplexity, and yet he found a pleasure in listening.
24429	41	6	21	  At length Herodias found her opportunity. Herod on his birthday gave a banquet to the nobles of his court and to the  tribunes and the principal people in Galilee,
24430	41	6	22	 at which  Herodias's own daughter came in and danced, and so charmed Herod and his guests that he said to her, "Ask me for anything you please, and I will give it to you."
24431	41	6	23	 He even swore to her, "Whatever you ask me for I will give you, up to half my kingdom."
24432	41	6	24	 She at once went out and said to her mother: "What shall I ask for?" "The head of John the Baptizer," she replied.
24433	41	6	25	 The girl immediately came in, in haste, to the King and made her request. "My desire is," she said, "that you will give me, here and now, on a dish, the head of John the Baptist."
24434	41	6	26	 Then the King, though intensely sorry, yet for the sake of his oaths, and of his guests, would not break faith with her.
24435	41	6	27	 He at once sent a soldier of his guard with orders to bring John's head. So he went and beheaded him in the prison,
24436	41	6	28	 and brought his head on a dish and gave it to the young girl, who gave it to her mother.
24437	41	6	29	 When John's disciples heard of it, they came and took away his body and laid it in a tomb.
24438	41	6	30	  When the Apostles had re-assembled round Jesus, they reported to Him all they had done and all they had taught.
24439	41	6	31	 Then He said to them, "Come away, all of you, to a quiet place, and rest awhile." For there were many coming and going, so that they had no time even for meals.
24440	41	6	32	 Accordingly they sailed away in the boat to a solitary place apart.
24441	41	6	33	 But the people saw them going, and many knew them; and coming by land they ran together there from all the neighbouring towns, and arrived before them.
24442	41	6	34	 So when Jesus landed, He saw a vast multitude; and His heart was moved with pity for them, because they were like sheep which have no shepherd, and He proceeded to teach them many things.
24443	41	6	35	 By this time it was late; so His disciples came to Him, and said, "This is a lonely place, and the hour is now late:
24444	41	6	36	 send them away that they may go to the farms and villages near here and buy themselves something to eat."
24445	41	6	37	 "Give them food yourselves," He replied. "Are we," they asked, "to go and buy two hundred shillings' worth of bread and give them food?"
24446	41	6	38	 "How many loaves have you?" He inquired; "go and see." So they found out, and said, "Five; and a couple of fish."
24447	41	6	39	 So He directed them to make all sit down in companies on the green grass.
24448	41	6	40	 And they sat down in  rows of hundreds and of fifties.
24449	41	6	41	 Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and lifting His eyes to Heaven He blessed the food. Then He broke the loaves into portions which He went on handing to the disciples to distribute; giving pieces also of the two fish to them all.
24450	41	6	42	 All ate and were fully satisfied.
24451	41	6	43	 And they carried away broken portions enough to fill twelve baskets, besides pieces of the fish.
24452	41	6	44	 Those who ate the bread were 5,000 adult men.
24453	41	6	45	  Immediately afterwards He made His disciples go on board the boat and cross over to Bethsaida, leaving Him behind to dismiss the crowd.
24454	41	6	46	 He then bade the people farewell, and went away up the hill to pray.
24455	41	6	47	 When evening was come, the boat was half way across the Lake, while he Himself was on shore alone.
24456	41	6	48	 But when He saw them distressed with rowing (for the wind was against them),  towards morning He came towards them walking on the Lake, as if intending to pass them.
24457	41	6	49	 They saw Him walking on the water, and thinking that it was a spirit they cried out;
24458	41	6	50	 for they all saw Him and were terrified. He, however, immediately spoke to them. "There is no danger," He said; "it is I; be not alarmed."
24459	41	6	51	 Then He went up to them on board the boat, and the wind lulled; and they were beside themselves with  silent amazement.
24460	41	6	52	 For they had not  learned the lesson taught by the loaves, but their  minds were dull.
24461	41	6	53	  Having crossed over they drew to land in Gennesaret and came  to anchor.
24462	41	6	54	 But no sooner had they gone ashore than the people immediately recognized Him.
24463	41	6	55	 Then they scoured the whole district, and began to bring Him the sick on their mats wherever they heard He was.
24464	41	6	56	 And enter wherever He might--village or town or hamlet--they laid their sick in the open places, and entreated Him to let them touch were it but the tassel of His robe; and all, whoever touched Him, were restored to health.
24465	41	7	1	  Then  the Pharisees, with certain Scribes who had come from Jerusalem, came to Him in a body.
24466	41	7	2	 They had noticed that some of His disciples were eating their food with `unclean' (that is to say, unwashed) hands.
24467	41	7	3	 (For the Pharisees and all the Jews--being, as they are, zealous for the traditions of the Elders--never eat without first  carefully washing their hands,
24468	41	7	4	 and when they come from market they will not eat without  bathing first; and they have a good many other customs which they have received traditionally and cling to, such as the rinsing of cups and pots and of bronze utensils,  and the washing of beds.)
24469	41	7	5	 So the Pharisees and Scribes put the question to Him: "Why do your disciples transgress the traditions of the Elders, and eat their  food with unclean hands?"
24470	41	7	6	 "Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites," He replied; "as it is written, <"`This People honour Me with their lips, while their hearts are far away from Me:
24471	41	7	7	 But idle is their devotion while they lay down precepts which are mere human rules.'>
24472	41	7	8	 "You neglect God's Commandment: you hold fast to men's traditions."
24473	41	7	9	 "Praiseworthy indeed!" He added, "to set at nought God's Commandment in order to observe your own traditions!
24474	41	7	10	 For Moses said, <`Honour thy father and thy mother'> and again, <`He who  curses father or mother, let him  die the death.'>
24475	41	7	11	 But *you* say, `If a man says to his father or mother, It is a Korban (that is, a thing  devoted to God), whatever it is, which otherwise you would have received  from me--'
24476	41	7	12	 And so you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or mother,
24477	41	7	13	 thus nullifying God's precept by  your tradition which you have handed down. And many things of that kind you do."
24478	41	7	14	 Then Jesus called the people to Him again. "Listen to me, all of you," He said, "and understand.
24479	41	7	15	 There is nothing  outside a man which entering him can make him unclean; but it is the things which come out of a man that make him unclean."
24480	41	7	16	  []
24481	41	7	17	 After He had left the crowd and gone indoors, His disciples began to ask Him about this figure of speech.
24482	41	7	18	 "Have *you* also so little understanding?" He replied; "do you not understand that anything whatever that enters a man from outside cannot make him unclean,
24483	41	7	19	 because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, and passes away ejected from him?" By these words Jesus pronounced all kinds of food clean.
24484	41	7	20	 "What comes out of a man," He added, "that it is which makes him unclean.
24485	41	7	21	 For from within, out of men's hearts, their evil purposes proceed--fornication, theft, murder, adultery,
24486	41	7	22	 covetousness, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, reviling, pride, reckless folly:
24487	41	7	23	 all these wicked things come out from within and make a man unclean."
24488	41	7	24	  Then He rose and left that place and went into the neighbourhood of Tyre  and Sidon. Here He entered a house and wished no one to know it, but He could not escape observation.
24489	41	7	25	 Forthwith a woman whose little daughter was possessed by a foul spirit heard of Him, and came and flung herself at His feet.
24490	41	7	26	 She was a  Gentile woman, a Syro-phoenician by nation: and again and again she begged Him to expel the demon from her daughter.
24491	41	7	27	 "Let the children first eat all they want," He said; "it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the  dogs."
24492	41	7	28	 "True, Sir," she replied, "and yet the dogs under the table eat the children's scraps."
24493	41	7	29	 "For those words of yours, go home," He replied; "the demon has gone out of your daughter."
24494	41	7	30	 So she went home, and found the child  lying on the bed, and the demon gone.
24495	41	7	31	  Returning from the neighbourhood of Tyre, He came by way of Sidon to the Lake of Galilee, passing through the district of the Ten Towns.
24496	41	7	32	 Here they brought to Him a deaf man that stammered, on whom they begged Him to lay His hands.
24497	41	7	33	 So Jesus taking him aside, apart from the crowd, put His fingers into his ears, and spat, and moistened his tongue;
24498	41	7	34	 and looking up to Heaven  He sighed, and said to him, "Ephphatha!" (that is, "Open!")
24499	41	7	35	 And the man's ears were opened, and his tongue became untied, and he began to speak perfectly.
24500	41	7	36	 Then Jesus charged them to tell no one; but the more He charged them, all the more did they spread the news far and wide.
24501	41	7	37	 The amazement was extreme.  "He succeeds in everything he attempts," they exclaimed; "he even makes deaf men hear and dumb men speak!"
24502	41	8	1	  About that time there was again an immense crowd, and they found themselves with nothing to eat. So He called His disciples to Him.
24503	41	8	2	 "My heart yearns over the people," He said; "for this is now  the third day they have remained with me, and they have nothing to eat.
24504	41	8	3	 If I were to send them home hungry, they would faint on the way, some of them having come a great distance."
24505	41	8	4	 "Where can we possibly get bread here in this remote place to satisfy such a crowd?" answered His disciples.
24506	41	8	5	 "How many loaves have you?" He asked. "Seven," they said.
24507	41	8	6	 So He passed the word to the people to sit down on the ground. Then taking the seven loaves He blessed them, and broke them into portions and proceeded to give them to His disciples for them to distribute, and they distributed them to the people.
24508	41	8	7	 They had also a few small fish. He blessed them, and He told His disciples to distribute these also.
24509	41	8	8	 So the people ate an abundant meal; and what remained over they picked up and carried away--seven hampers of broken pieces.
24510	41	8	9	 The number fed were about 4,000. Then He sent them away,
24511	41	8	10	  and at once going on board with His disciples He came into the district of Dalmanutha.
24512	41	8	11	 The Pharisees followed Him and began to dispute with Him, asking Him for a sign  in the sky, to make trial of Him.
24513	41	8	12	 Heaving a deep and troubled sigh, He said, "Why do the men of to-day ask for a sign? In solemn truth I tell you that no sign will be given to the men of to-day."
24514	41	8	13	  So He left them, went on board again, and came away to the other side.
24515	41	8	14	 Now they had forgotten to take bread, nor had they more than a single loaf with them in the boat;
24516	41	8	15	 and when He admonished them, "See to it, be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod,"
24517	41	8	16	 they explained His words to one another by saying, "We have no bread!"
24518	41	8	17	 He perceived what they were saying, and He said to them, "What is this discussion of yours about having no bread? Do you not yet see and understand? Are your minds so dull of comprehension?
24519	41	8	18	 <You have eyes! can you not see? You have ears! can you not hear?> and  have you no memory?
24520	41	8	19	 When I broke up the five loaves for the 5,000 men, how many baskets did you carry away full of broken portions?" "Twelve," they said.
24521	41	8	20	 "And when the seven for the 4,000, how many hampers full of portions did you take away?" "Seven," they answered.
24522	41	8	21	 "Do you not yet understand?"  He said.
24523	41	8	22	 And they came to Bethsaida. And a blind man was brought to Jesus and they entreated Him to touch him.
24524	41	8	23	 So He took the blind man by the  arm and brought him out of the village, and spitting into his eyes He put His hands on him and asked him, "Can you see anything?"
24525	41	8	24	 He looked up and said, "I can see the people: I see them like trees--only walking."
24526	41	8	25	 Then for the second time He put His hands on the man's eyes, and the man, looking steadily, recovered his sight and saw everything distinctly.
24527	41	8	26	 So He sent him home, and added, "Do not even go into the village."
24528	41	8	27	  From that place Jesus and His disciples went to the villages belonging to Caesarea Philippi. On the way He  began to ask His disciples, "Who do people say that I am?"
24529	41	8	28	 "John the Baptist," they replied, "but others say Elijah, and others, that it is one of the Prophets."
24530	41	8	29	 Then  He asked them pointedly, "But you yourselves, who do you say that I am?" "You are  the Christ," answered Peter.
24531	41	8	30	 And He strictly forbad them to tell this about Him to any one.
24532	41	8	31	 And now for the first time He told them, "The Son of Man  must endure much suffering, and be rejected by the Elders and the High Priests and the Scribes, and be put to death, and after two days  rise to life."
24533	41	8	32	 This He told them plainly; whereupon Peter took Him and began to remonstrate with Him.
24534	41	8	33	 But turning round and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter. "Get behind me,  Adversary," He said, "for your thoughts are not God's thoughts, but men's."
24535	41	8	34	 Then calling to Him the crowd and also His disciples, He said to them, "If any one is desirous of following me, let him ignore self and take up his cross, and so be my follower.
24536	41	8	35	 For whoever is bent on securing his  life will lose it, but he who loses his  life for my sake, and for the sake of the Good News, will secure it.
24537	41	8	36	  Why, what does it benefit a man to gain the whole world and  forfeit his life?
24538	41	8	37	 For what could a man give to buy back his life?
24539	41	8	38	 Every one, however, who  has been ashamed of me and of my teachings in this  faithless and sinful age, of him the Son of Man also will be ashamed when He comes in His Father's glory with the holy angels."
24540	41	9	1	 He went on to say, "In solemn truth I tell you that some of those who  are standing here will certainly not taste death till they have seen the Kingdom of God  already come  in power."
24541	41	9	2	  Six days later, Jesus took with Him Peter, James, and John, and brought them alone, apart from the rest, up a high mountain; and in their presence His appearance underwent a change.
24542	41	9	3	 His garments also became dazzling with brilliant whiteness--such whiteness as no bleaching on earth could give.
24543	41	9	4	 Moreover there appeared to them Elijah accompanied by Moses; and the two were conversing with Jesus,
24544	41	9	5	 when  Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi,  we are thankful to you that we are here. Let us put up three  tents--one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
24545	41	9	6	 For he knew not what  to say: they were filled with such awe.
24546	41	9	7	 Then there came a cloud  spreading over them, and a voice issued from the cloud, "This is my Son, dearly loved: listen to Him."
24547	41	9	8	 Instantly they looked round, and now they could no longer see any one, but themselves and Jesus.
24548	41	9	9	 As they were coming down from the mountain, He very strictly forbad them to tell any one what they had seen "until after the Son of Man has risen from among the dead."
24549	41	9	10	 So they kept the matter to themselves, although frequently asking one another what was meant by the rising from the dead.
24550	41	9	11	 They also asked Him, "How is it that the Scribes say that Elijah must first come?"
24551	41	9	12	 "Elijah," He replied, "does indeed come first and reforms everything; but how is it that it is written of the Son of Man that He will endure much suffering and be held in contempt?
24552	41	9	13	 Yet I tell you that not only has Elijah come, but they have also done to him whatever they chose, as the Scriptures say about him."
24553	41	9	14	  As they came to rejoin the disciples, they saw an immense crowd surrounding them and a party of Scribes disputing with them.
24554	41	9	15	 Immediately the whole multitude on beholding Him were  astonished and awe-struck, and yet they ran forward and  greeted Him.
24555	41	9	16	 "What is the subject you are discussing?" He asked them.
24556	41	9	17	  "Rabbi," answered one of the crowd,  "I have brought you my son. He has a dumb spirit in him;
24557	41	9	18	 and wherever it comes upon him, it  dashes him to the ground, and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth, and he is pining away. I  begged your disciples to expel it, but they had not the power."
24558	41	9	19	 "O unbelieving generation!" replied Jesus; "how long must I be with you? how long must I have patience with you? Bring the boy to me."
24559	41	9	20	 So they brought him to Jesus. And the spirit,  when he saw Jesus, immediately threw the youth into convulsions, so that he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.
24560	41	9	21	 Then Jesus asked the father, "How long has he been like this?" "From early childhood," he said;
24561	41	9	22	 "and often it has thrown him into the fire  or into  pools of water to destroy him. But, if you possibly can, have pity on us and help us."
24562	41	9	23	 "`If I possibly can!'" replied Jesus; "why, everything is possible to him who believes."
24563	41	9	24	 Immediately the father  cried out, "I do believe: strengthen my weak faith."
24564	41	9	25	 Then Jesus, seeing that an increasing crowd was running towards Him, rebuked the foul spirit, and said to it, "Dumb and deaf spirit, *I* command you, come out of him and never enter into him again."
24565	41	9	26	 So with a loud cry he threw the boy into fit after fit, and came out. The boy looked as if he were dead, so that most of them said  he was dead;
24566	41	9	27	 but Jesus took his hand and raised him up, and he stood on his feet.
24567	41	9	28	 After the return of Jesus  to the house His disciples asked Him privately, "How is it that we could not expel the spirit?"
24568	41	9	29	 "An evil spirit of this kind," He answered, "can only be driven out  by prayer."
24569	41	9	30	  Departing thence they passed through Galilee, and He was unwilling that any one should know it;
24570	41	9	31	 for He was teaching His disciples, and telling them, "The Son of Man is to be betrayed into the hands of men, and they will put Him to death; and after being put to death, in three days He will rise to life again."
24571	41	9	32	 They, however, did not understand what He meant, and were afraid to question Him.
24572	41	9	33	  So they came to Capernaum; and when in the house He asked them, "What were you arguing about on the way?"
24573	41	9	34	 But they remained silent; for on the way they had debated with one another who was the chief of them.
24574	41	9	35	 Then sitting down He called the Twelve, and said to them, "If any one wishes to be first,  he must be last of all and servant of all."
24575	41	9	36	 And taking a young child He made him stand in their midst, then threw His arms round him and said,
24576	41	9	37	 "Whoever  for my sake receives one such young child as this, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not so much me as Him who sent me."
24577	41	9	38	  "Rabbi,"  said John to Him, "we saw a  man making use of your name to expel demons, and we tried to hinder him,  on the ground that he did not follow us."
24578	41	9	39	  "You should not have tried to hinder him," replied Jesus, "for there is no one who will use my name to perform a miracle and be able the next minute to speak evil of me.
24579	41	9	40	  He who is not against us is for us;
24580	41	9	41	  and whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ, I solemnly tell you that he will certainly not lose his reward.
24581	41	9	42	  "And whoever shall occasion the fall of one of these little ones who  believe, he would be better off if, with a  millstone round his neck, he were  lying at the bottom of the sea.
24582	41	9	43	 If your hand should  cause you to sin, cut it off: it would be better for you to enter into Life maimed, than remain in possession of both your hands and go away into Gehenna, into the  fire which cannot be put out.
24583	41	9	44	  []
24584	41	9	45	 Or if your foot  should cause you to sin, cut it off: it would be better for you to enter into Life crippled, than remain in possession of both your feet and be thrown into Gehenna.
24585	41	9	46	  []
24586	41	9	47	 Or if your eye  should cause you to sin, tear it out. It would be better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God half-blind than remain in possession of two eyes and be thrown into Gehenna,
24587	41	9	48	 where <their worm does not die and the fire does not go out.>
24588	41	9	49	 Every one,  however, will be salted  with fire.
24589	41	9	50	 Salt is a good thing, but if the salt should become tasteless, what will you use to give it saltness? Have salt within you and live at peace with one another."
24590	41	10	1	  Soon on His feet once more, He enters the district of Judaea and crosses the Jordan: again the people flock to Him, and ere long, as was usual with Him, He was teaching them once more.
24591	41	10	2	  Presently a party of Pharisees come to Him with the question--seeking to entrap Him, "May a man divorce his wife?"
24592	41	10	3	 "What rule did Moses lay down for you?" He answered.
24593	41	10	4	 "Moses," they said, "permitted a man to draw up a written notice of divorce, and to send his wife away."
24594	41	10	5	 "It was in consideration of your stubborn hearts," said Jesus, "that Moses enacted this law for you;
24595	41	10	6	 but from the beginning of the creation the rule was, <`Male and female did God make them.
24596	41	10	7	 For this reason a man  shall leave his father and his mother, and  shall cling to his wife,
24597	41	10	8	 and the two  shall be  one';> so that they are two no longer, but  <`one.'>
24598	41	10	9	 What, therefore, God has joined together let not man separate."
24599	41	10	10	 Indoors the disciples began questioning Jesus again on the same subject.
24600	41	10	11	 He replied, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman, commits adultery against the first wife;
24601	41	10	12	 and if a woman puts away her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery."
24602	41	10	13	  One day people were bringing young children to Jesus for Him to touch them, but the disciples interfered.
24603	41	10	14	 Jesus, however, on seeing this, was moved to indignation, and said to them, "Let the little children come to me: do not hinder them; for to those who are childlike the Kingdom of God belongs.
24604	41	10	15	 In solemn truth I tell you that no one who does not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child will by any possibility enter it."
24605	41	10	16	 Then He  took them in His arms and blessed them lovingly,  one by one, laying His hands upon them.
24606	41	10	17	  As He went out to resume His journey, there came  a man running up to Him, who knelt at His feet and asked, "Good Rabbi, what am I to do in order to inherit the Life  of the Ages?"
24607	41	10	18	 "Why do you call me good?" asked Jesus in reply; "there is no one truly good except One--that is, God.
24608	41	10	19	 You know the Commandments--<`Do not murder;' `Do not commit adultery;' `Do not steal;' `Do not lie in giving evidence;' `Do not defraud;' `Honour thy father and thy mother.'">
24609	41	10	20	 "Rabbi," he replied, "all these Commandments I have carefully obeyed from my youth."
24610	41	10	21	 Then Jesus looked at him and  loved him, and said, "One thing is lacking in you: go, sell all you possess and  give the proceeds to the poor, and you shall have riches in Heaven; and come and be a follower of mine."
24611	41	10	22	 At these words his brow darkened, and he went away sad; for he was possessed of great wealth.
24612	41	10	23	 Then looking round on His disciples Jesus said, "With how hard a struggle will the possessors of riches enter the Kingdom of God!"
24613	41	10	24	 The disciples were  amazed at His words. Jesus, however,  said again, "Children, how hard a struggle is it  for those who trust in riches to enter the Kingdom of God!
24614	41	10	25	 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God."
24615	41	10	26	 They were astonished beyond measure, and said to one another, "Who then *can* be saved?"
24616	41	10	27	 Jesus looking on them said, "With men it is impossible, but not with God; for everything is possible with God."
24617	41	10	28	 "Remember,"  said Peter to Him, "that we forsook everything and have become your followers."
24618	41	10	29	 "In solemn truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "that there is no one who has forsaken house or brothers or sisters, or mother or father, or children or lands, for my sake and for the sake of the Good News,
24619	41	10	30	 but will receive a hundred times as much now  in this present life--houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, lands--and persecution with them--and in the coming age the Life  of the Ages.
24620	41	10	31	 But many who are now first will be last, and the last, first."
24621	41	10	32	  They were still on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them; they were full of wonder, and some, though they followed, did so with fear. Then, once more calling to Him the Twelve, He began to tell them what was about to happen to Him.
24622	41	10	33	 "See," He said, "we are going up to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man will be betrayed to the High Priests and the Scribes. They will condemn Him to death, and will hand Him over to the Gentiles;
24623	41	10	34	 they will insult Him in cruel sport, spit on Him,  scourge Him, and put Him to death; but on the third day He will rise to life again."
24624	41	10	35	  Then James and John, the sons of Zabdi, came up to Him and said,  "Rabbi, we wish you would grant us  whatever request we make of you."
24625	41	10	36	 "What would you have me do for you?" He asked.
24626	41	10	37	 "Allow us," they replied, "to sit one at your right hand and the other at your left hand, in your glory."
24627	41	10	38	 "You know not," said He, "what you are asking. Are you able to drink out of the  cup from which I am to drink, or to be baptized with the  baptism with which I am to be baptized?"
24628	41	10	39	 "We are able," they replied. "Out of the cup," said Jesus, "from which I am to drink you shall drink, and with the baptism with which I am to be baptized you shall be baptized;
24629	41	10	40	 but as to sitting at my right hand or at my left, that is not mine to give: it will be for those for whom it is reserved."
24630	41	10	41	 The other ten, hearing of it, were at first highly indignant with James and John.
24631	41	10	42	 Jesus, however, called them to Him and said to them, "You are aware how those who are deemed rulers among the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men make them feel their authority;
24632	41	10	43	 but it is not to be so among you. No, whoever desires to be great among you must be your servant;
24633	41	10	44	 and whoever desires to be first among you must be the bondservant of all.
24634	41	10	45	 For the Son of Man also did not come to be waited upon, but to wait on others, and to give His  life as the redemption-price for a multitude of people."
24635	41	10	46	  They came to Jericho; and as He was leaving that town--Himself and His disciples and a great crowd--Bartimaeus (the son of Timaeus), a blind beggar, was sitting by the way-side.
24636	41	10	47	 Hearing that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, "Son of David, Jesus, have pity on me."
24637	41	10	48	 Many angrily told him to leave off shouting; but he only cried out all the louder, "Son of David, have pity on me."
24638	41	10	49	 Then Jesus stood still. "Call him," He said. So they called the blind man. "Cheer up," they said; "rise, he is calling you."
24639	41	10	50	 The man flung away his outer garment, sprang to his feet, and came to Jesus.
24640	41	10	51	 "What shall I do for you?"  said Jesus.  "Rabboni," replied the blind man, "let me  recover my sight."
24641	41	10	52	 "Go," said Jesus, "your faith has cured you." Instantly he  regained his sight, and followed Him along the road.
24642	41	11	1	  When they were getting near Jerusalem and had arrived at Bethphage and Bethany, on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples on in front, with these instructions.
24643	41	11	2	 "Go," He said, "to the village facing you, and immediately on entering it you will find an ass's foal tied up which no one has ever yet ridden: untie him and bring him here.
24644	41	11	3	 And if any one asks you, `Why are you doing that?' say, `The Master needs it, and will send it back here without delay.'"
24645	41	11	4	 So they went and found a young ass tied up at the front door of a house. They were untying it,
24646	41	11	5	 when some of the bystanders called out, "What are you doing, untying the foal?"
24647	41	11	6	 But on their giving the answer that Jesus had bidden them give, they let them take it.
24648	41	11	7	 So they brought the foal to Jesus, and threw their outer garments over him; and Jesus mounted.
24649	41	11	8	 Then many spread their outer garments to carpet the road, and others leafy branches which they had cut down  in the fields;
24650	41	11	9	 while those who led the way and those who followed kept shouting <"God save Him!" Blessed be He who comes in the Lord's name.>
24651	41	11	10	 Blessings on the coming Kingdom of our forefather David! <God in the highest Heavens save Him!">
24652	41	11	11	 So He came into Jerusalem and into  the Temple; and after looking round upon everything there, the hour being now late He went out to Bethany with the Twelve.
24653	41	11	12	  The next day, after they had left Bethany, He was hungry.
24654	41	11	13	 But in the distance He saw a fig-tree in full leaf, and went to see whether perhaps He could find some figs on it. When however He came to it, He found nothing but leaves (for it was  not fig time);
24655	41	11	14	 and He said to the tree, "Let no one ever again eat fruit from thee!" And His disciples heard this.
24656	41	11	15	  They reached Jerusalem, and entering the Temple He began to drive out the buyers and sellers, and upset the money-changers' tables and the stools of the pigeon-dealers,
24657	41	11	16	 and would not allow any one to carry  anything through the Temple.
24658	41	11	17	 And He remonstrated with them. "Is it not written," He said, <"`My House shall be called The House of Prayer for all the nations?'> But you  have made it what it now is--<a robbers' cave.">
24659	41	11	18	 This the High Priests and Scribes heard, and they began to devise means to destroy Him. For they were afraid of Him, because of the deep impression produced on all the people by His teaching.
24660	41	11	19	 When evening came on, Jesus and His disciples used to leave the city.
24661	41	11	20	  In the early morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig-tree withered to the roots;
24662	41	11	21	 and Peter, recollecting, said to Him, "Look, Rabbi, the fig-tree which you cursed is withered up."
24663	41	11	22	 Jesus said to them, "Have faith in God.
24664	41	11	23	 In solemn truth I tell you that if any one shall say to this mountain, `Remove, and hurl thyself into the sea,' and has no doubt about it in his heart, but stedfastly believes that what he says will happen, it shall be granted him.
24665	41	11	24	 That is why I tell you, as to whatever you pray and make request for, if you believe that you have received it it shall be yours.
24666	41	11	25	 But whenever you stand praying, if you have a grievance against any one, forgive it, so that your Father in Heaven may also forgive you your offences."
24667	41	11	26	  []
24668	41	11	27	  They came again to Jerusalem; and as He was walking in the Temple, the High Priests, Scribes and Elders came to Him
24669	41	11	28	 and asked,  "By what authority are you doing these things? and who gave you authority to do them?"
24670	41	11	29	 "And I will put a question to you," replied Jesus; "answer me, and then I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
24671	41	11	30	 John's Baptism--was it of Heavenly or of human origin? Answer me."
24672	41	11	31	 So they debated the matter with one another. "Suppose we say, `Heavenly,'" they argued, "he will ask, `Why then did you not believe him?'
24673	41	11	32	 Or should we say, `human?'" They were afraid of the people; for all agreed in holding John to have been really a Prophet.
24674	41	11	33	 So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." "Nor do I tell you," said Jesus, "by what authority I do these things."
24675	41	12	1	  Then He began to speak to them in figurative language. "There was once a man," He said, "who planted a vineyard, fenced it round, dug a pit for the wine-tank, and built a strong lodge. Then he let the place to vine-dressers and went abroad.
24676	41	12	2	 At vintage-time he sent one of his servants to receive from the vine-dressers a share of the grapes.
24677	41	12	3	 But they seized him, beat him cruelly and sent him away empty-handed.
24678	41	12	4	 Again he sent to them another servant: and as for him, they  wounded him in the head and treated him shamefully.
24679	41	12	5	 Yet a third he sent, and him they killed. And he sent many besides, and them also they ill-treated, beating some and killing others.
24680	41	12	6	 He had still one left whom he could send, a dearly-loved son: him last of all he sent, saying, "`They will treat my son with respect.'
24681	41	12	7	 "But those men--the vine-dressers--said to one another, "`Here is the heir: come, let us kill him, and then the property will one day be ours.'
24682	41	12	8	 "So they took him and killed him, and flung  his body outside the vineyard.
24683	41	12	9	 What, therefore, will the owner of the vineyard do?" "He will come and put the vine-dressers to death," they said; "and will give the vineyard to others."
24684	41	12	10	 "Have you not read even this passage," He added, <"`The stone which the builders rejected has become the Cornerstone:
24685	41	12	11	  this Cornerstone came from the Lord, and is wonderful in our esteem?'">
24686	41	12	12	 And they kept looking out for an opportunity to seize Him, but were afraid of the people; for they saw that in this parable He had referred to *them*. So they left Him and went away.
24687	41	12	13	  Their next step was to send to Him some of the Pharisees and of Herod's partisans to entrap Him in conversation.
24688	41	12	14	 So they came to Him.  "Rabbi," they said, "we know that you are a truthful man and you do not fear any one; for you do not recognize human distinctions, but teach God's way truly. Is it allowable to pay poll-tax to Caesar, or not?
24689	41	12	15	 Shall we pay, or shall we refuse to pay?" But He, knowing their hypocrisy, replied, "Why try to ensnare me? Bring me a shilling for me to look at."
24690	41	12	16	 They brought one; and He asked them, "Whose is this likeness and this inscription?" "Caesar's," they replied.
24691	41	12	17	 "What is Caesar's," replied Jesus, "pay to Caesar--and what is God's, pay to God." And they wondered exceedingly at Him.
24692	41	12	18	  Then came to Him a party of Sadducees, a sect which denies that there is any Resurrection; and they proceeded to question Him.
24693	41	12	19	 "Rabbi," they said, "Moses made it a law for us: <`If a man's brother should die and leave a wife, but no child, the man shall marry the widow and raise up a family for his brother.'>
24694	41	12	20	 There were once seven brothers, the eldest of whom married a wife, but at his death left no family.
24695	41	12	21	 The second married her, and died, leaving no family; and the third did the same.
24696	41	12	22	 And so did the rest of the seven, all dying childless. Finally the woman also died.
24697	41	12	23	 At the Resurrection whose wife will she be? For they all seven married her."
24698	41	12	24	 "Is not this the cause of your error," replied Jesus--"your ignorance alike of the Scriptures and of the power of God?
24699	41	12	25	 For when they have risen from among the dead, men do not marry and women are not given in marriage, but they are as angels are in Heaven.
24700	41	12	26	 But as to the dead, that they  rise to life, have you never read in the Book of Moses, in the passage about the Bush, how God said to him, <`I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?'>
24701	41	12	27	 He is not the God of dead, but of living men. You are in grave error."
24702	41	12	28	  Then one of the Scribes, who had heard them disputing and well knew that Jesus had given them an answer to the point, and a forcible one, came forward and asked Him, "Which is the chief of all the Commandments?"
24703	41	12	29	 "The chief Commandment," replied Jesus, "is this: <`Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God is one Lord;
24704	41	12	30	 and thou shalt love the Lord thy God  with thy whole heart, thy whole soul, thy whole mind, and thy whole strength.'>
24705	41	12	31	 "The second is this: <`Thou shalt love thy  fellow man as thou lovest thyself.'> "Other Commandment greater than these there is none."
24706	41	12	32	 So the Scribe said to Him, "Rightly, in very truth, Rabbi, have you said that <He stands alone, and there is none but He;>
24707	41	12	33	 and <To love Him with all one's heart, with all one's understanding, and with all one's strength, and to love one's fellow man no less than oneself,> is far better than all our <whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.">
24708	41	12	34	  Perceiving that the Scribe had answered wisely Jesus said to him, "You are not far from the Kingdom of God." No one from that time forward ventured to put any question to Him.
24709	41	12	35	  But, while teaching in the Temple, Jesus asked, "How is it the Scribes say that the Christ is a son of David?
24710	41	12	36	 David himself said, taught by the Holy Spirit, <"`The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, until  I have made thy foes a footstool under thy feet.'>
24711	41	12	37	 "David himself calls Him `Lord:' how then can He be his son?" And the mass of people found pleasure in listening to Jesus.
24712	41	12	38	  Moreover in the course of His teaching He said,  "Be on your guard against the Scribes who like to walk about in long robes and to be bowed to in places of public resort,
24713	41	12	39	 and to occupy the best seats  in the synagogues and at dinner parties,
24714	41	12	40	 and who swallow up the property of widows and then mask their wickedness by making long prayers: these men will receive far heavier punishment."
24715	41	12	41	  Having taken a seat opposite the Treasury, He observed how the people were dropping money into the Treasury, and that many of the wealthy threw in large sums.
24716	41	12	42	 But there came one poor widow and dropped in two farthings, equal in value to a halfpenny.
24717	41	12	43	 So He called His disciples to Him and said, "In solemn truth I tell you that this widow, poor as she is, has thrown in more than all the other contributors to the Treasury;
24718	41	12	44	 for they have all contributed out of what they could well spare, but she out of her need has thrown in all she possessed--all she had to live on."
24719	41	13	1	  As He was leaving the Temple, one of His disciples exclaimed, "Look,  Rabbi,  what wonderful stones!  what wonderful buildings!"
24720	41	13	2	 "You see all these great buildings?" Jesus replied;  "not one stone will be left here upon another--not thrown down."
24721	41	13	3	 He was sitting  on the Mount of Olives opposite to the Temple, when Peter, James, John, and Andrew, apart from the others asked Him,
24722	41	13	4	 "Tell us, When will these things be? and what will be the sign when all these predictions are on the point of being fulfilled?"
24723	41	13	5	 So Jesus began to say to them: "Take care that no one misleads you.
24724	41	13	6	 Many will come  assuming my name and saying, `I am He;' and they will mislead many.
24725	41	13	7	 But when you hear of wars and rumours of wars, do not be alarmed: come they must, but the End is not yet.
24726	41	13	8	 For <nation  will rise in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.> There will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. These miseries are but like the early pains of childbirth.
24727	41	13	9	  "You yourselves must be on your guard. They will deliver you up to Sanhedrins; you will be brought into synagogues and cruelly beaten; and you will stand before governors and kings for my sake, to be witnesses to them for me.
24728	41	13	10	 But the proclamation of the Good News must be carried to all the Gentiles  before the End comes.
24729	41	13	11	 When however they are marching you along under arrest, do not be anxious beforehand about what you are to say, but speak what is given you when the time comes; for it will not be you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.
24730	41	13	12	 "Brother will betray brother to be killed, and fathers will betray children; and <children will rise against their parents> and have them put to death.
24731	41	13	13	 You will be objects of universal hatred because you are called by my name, but those who stand firm to the End will be saved.
24732	41	13	14	  "As soon, however, as you see the <Abomination of Desolation> standing where  he ought not" --let the reader observe these words--"then let those in Judaea  escape to the hills;
24733	41	13	15	 let him who is on the roof not come down and enter the house to fetch anything out of it;
24734	41	13	16	 and let not him who is in the field turn back to pick up his outer garment.
24735	41	13	17	 And alas for the women who at that time are with child or have infants!
24736	41	13	18	 "But pray that it may not come in the winter.
24737	41	13	19	 For those will be times of <suffering the like of which has never been from the  first creation of God's world until now,> and assuredly  never will be again;
24738	41	13	20	 and but for the fact that the Lord has cut short those days, no one would escape; but for the sake of His own People whom He has chosen for Himself He has cut short the days.
24739	41	13	21	  "At that time if any one says to you, `See, here is the Christ!' or `See, He is there!' do not believe it.
24740	41	13	22	 For <there will rise up> false Christs and false <prophets, displaying signs and prodigies> with a view to lead astray--if indeed that were possible--even God's own People.
24741	41	13	23	 But as for yourselves, be on your guard: I have forewarned you of everything.
24742	41	13	24	 <"At that time,> however, after that <distress, the sun will  be darkened and the moon will not shed her light;
24743	41	13	25	 the stars will be seen falling from the firmament, and the  forces which are in the heavens will be disordered and disturbed.>
24744	41	13	26	 And then will they see <the Son of Man coming in clouds> with great power and glory.
24745	41	13	27	 Then He will send forth the angels and gather together His chosen People from north, south, east and west, from the remotest parts of the earth and the sky.
24746	41	13	28	 "Learn from the fig-tree the lesson it teaches. As soon as its branch has become soft and it is bursting into leaf, you know that summer is near.
24747	41	13	29	 So also do you, when you see these things happening, be sure that  He is near, at your very door.
24748	41	13	30	 I tell you in solemn truth that  the present generation will certainly not pass away without all these things having first taken place.
24749	41	13	31	  Earth and sky will pass away, but it is certain that my words will not pass away.
24750	41	13	32	 "But as to that day or the exact time no one knows--not even the angels in Heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.
24751	41	13	33	 Take care, be on the alert,  and pray; for you do not know when it will happen.
24752	41	13	34	 It is like a man living abroad who has left his house, and given the management to his  servants--to each one his special duty--and has ordered the porter to keep awake.
24753	41	13	35	 Be wakeful therefore, for you know not when the master of the house is coming--in the evening, at midnight, at cock-crow, or at dawn.
24754	41	13	36	  Beware lest He should arrive unexpectedly and find you asleep.
24755	41	13	37	 Moreover, what I say to you I say to all--Be wakeful!"
24756	41	14	1	  It was now  two days before the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread, and the High Priests and Scribes were bent on finding how to seize Him by stratagem and put Him to death.
24757	41	14	2	 But they said, "Not on the Festival-day, for fear there should be a riot among the people."
24758	41	14	3	  Now when He was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the Leper, while He was at table, there came a woman with a jar of  pure, sweet-scented ointment very costly: she broke the jar and poured the ointment over His head.
24759	41	14	4	 But there were some who said indignantly among themselves, "Why has the ointment been thus wasted?
24760	41	14	5	 For that ointment might have been sold for  fifteen pounds or more,  and the money have been given to the poor." And they were exceedingly angry with her.
24761	41	14	6	 But Jesus said, "Leave her alone: why are you troubling her? She has done a most gracious act towards me.
24762	41	14	7	 For you always have the poor among you, and whenever you choose you can do acts of kindness to them; but me you have not always.
24763	41	14	8	 What she could she did: she has perfumed my body in preparation for my burial.
24764	41	14	9	 And I solemnly tell you that wherever in the whole world the Good News shall be proclaimed, this which she has done shall also be told in remembrance of her."
24765	41	14	10	  But Judas Iscariot,  already mentioned as one of the Twelve, went to the High Priests to betray Jesus to them.
24766	41	14	11	 They gladly listened to his proposal, and promised to give him a sum of money. So he looked out for an opportunity to betray Him.
24767	41	14	12	  On the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread--the day for killing the Passover lamb--His disciples asked Him, "Where shall we go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
24768	41	14	13	 So He sent two of His disciples with instructions, saying, "Go into the city, and you will meet  a man carrying a pitcher of water: follow him,
24769	41	14	14	 and whatever house he enters, tell the master of the house, `The  Rabbi asks, Where is my  room where I can eat the Passover with my disciples?'
24770	41	14	15	 Then he will himself show you a large room upstairs, ready furnished: there make preparation for us."
24771	41	14	16	 So the disciples went out and came to the city, and found everything just as He had told them; and they got the Passover ready.
24772	41	14	17	  When it was evening, He came with the Twelve.
24773	41	14	18	  And while they were at table Jesus said, "I solemnly tell you that one of you will betray me--one who is eating with me."
24774	41	14	19	 They were filled with sorrow, and began asking Him, one by one, "Not I, is it?"
24775	41	14	20	 "It is one of the Twelve," He replied; "he who is dipping his fingers in the dish with me.
24776	41	14	21	 For the Son of Man is going His way as it is written about Him; but alas for the man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It had been a happy thing for that man, had he never been born."
24777	41	14	22	  Also during the meal He took a Passover biscuit, blessed it, and broke it. He then gave it to them, saying,  "Take this, it is my body."
24778	41	14	23	 Then He  took the cup, gave thanks, and handed it to them, and they all of them drank  from it.
24779	41	14	24	 "This is my blood," He said, "which is to be poured out on behalf of many--the blood  which makes  the Covenant sure.
24780	41	14	25	 I solemnly tell you that never again will I taste the produce of the vine till I shall drink the new wine in the Kingdom of God."
24781	41	14	26	  After singing  a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
24782	41	14	27	  Then said Jesus to them, "All of you are about to stumble and fall, for it is written, <`I will strike down the Shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered in all directions.'>
24783	41	14	28	 But after I have risen to life again I will go before you into Galilee."
24784	41	14	29	 "All may stumble and fall," said Peter, "yet I never will."
24785	41	14	30	 "I solemnly tell you," replied Jesus, "that to-day--this night--before the cock crows twice, you yourself will three times disown me."
24786	41	14	31	 "Even if I must die with you," declared Peter again and again, "I will never disown you." In like manner protested also all the disciples.
24787	41	14	32	  So they came to a place called Gethsemane. There He said to His disciples, "Sit down here till I have prayed."
24788	41	14	33	 Then He took with Him Peter and James and John, and began to be full of terror and distress,
24789	41	14	34	 and He said to them, "My heart is oppressed with anguish to the very point of death: wait here and keep awake."
24790	41	14	35	 Going forward a short distance He threw Himself upon His face and prayed repeatedly that, if it was possible,  He might be spared that time of agony;
24791	41	14	36	 and He said, "Abba!  my Father! all things are possible for Thee:  take this  cup of suffering away from me: and yet not what I desire, but what Thou desirest."
24792	41	14	37	 Then He came and found them asleep, and He said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Had you not strength to keep awake a single hour?
24793	41	14	38	 Be wakeful, all of you, and keep on praying, that you may not come into temptation:  the spirit is right willing, but the body is frail."
24794	41	14	39	 He again went away and prayed, using the very same words.
24795	41	14	40	 When He returned He again found them asleep, for they were very tired; and they knew not how to answer Him.
24796	41	14	41	 A third time He came, and then He said, "Sleep on and rest. Enough! the hour has come. Even now they are betraying the Son of Man into the hands of sinful men.
24797	41	14	42	 Rouse yourselves, let us be going: my betrayer is close at hand."
24798	41	14	43	  Immediately, while He was still speaking,  Judas, one of the Twelve, came and with him a crowd of men armed with swords and cudgels, sent by the High Priests and Scribes and Elders.
24799	41	14	44	 Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. "The one I kiss," he said, "is the man: lay hold of him, and take him safely away."
24800	41	14	45	 So he came, and going straight to Jesus he said, "Rabbi!" and kissed Him with seeming affection;
24801	41	14	46	 whereupon they laid hands on Him and held Him firmly.
24802	41	14	47	 But one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck a blow at the High Priest's  servant, cutting off his ear.
24803	41	14	48	 "Have you come out," said Jesus, "with swords and cudgels to arrest me, as if you had to fight with a robber?
24804	41	14	49	 Day after day I used to be among you in the Temple teaching, and you never seized me. But  this is happening in order that the Scriptures may be fulfilled.'
24805	41	14	50	 Then His friends all forsook Him and fled.
24806	41	14	51	 One youth indeed did follow Him,  wearing only a  linen cloth round his bare body. Of him they laid hold,
24807	41	14	52	 but he left the linen cloth in their hands and fled  without it.
24808	41	14	53	  So they led Jesus away to the High Priest, and  with him there assembled all the High Priests, Elders, and Scribes.
24809	41	14	54	 Peter followed Jesus at a distance, as far as the outer court of the High Priest's palace. But there he remained sitting among the  officers, and warming himself  by the fire.
24810	41	14	55	  Meanwhile the High Priests and the entire Sanhedrin were endeavouring to get evidence against Jesus in order to put Him to death, but could find none;
24811	41	14	56	 for though many gave false testimony against Him, their statements did not tally.
24812	41	14	57	 Then some came forward as witnesses and falsely declared,
24813	41	14	58	 "We have heard him say, `I will pull down this Sanctuary built by human hands, and three days afterwards I will erect another built without hands.'"
24814	41	14	59	 But not even in this shape was their testimony consistent.
24815	41	14	60	 At last the High Priest stood up, and advancing into the midst of them all, asked Jesus, "Have you no answer to make? What is the meaning of all this that these witnesses allege against you?"
24816	41	14	61	 But He remained silent, and gave no reply. A second time the High Priest questioned Him. "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?" he said.
24817	41	14	62	 "I am," replied Jesus, "and  you and others will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the  divine Power, and coming amid the clouds of the sky."
24818	41	14	63	 Rending his garments the High Priest exclaimed, "What need have we of witnesses after that?
24819	41	14	64	 You all heard his impious words. What is your judgement?" Then with one voice they condemned Him as deserving of death.
24820	41	14	65	 Thereupon some began to spit on Him, and to blindfold Him, while striking Him with their fists and crying,  "Prove that you are a prophet." The  officers too  struck Him with  open hands as they took Him in charge.
24821	41	14	66	 Now while Peter was below in the quadrangle, one of the High Priest's maidservants came,
24822	41	14	67	 and seeing Peter warming himself she looked at him and said, "You also were with Jesus, the Nazarene."
24823	41	14	68	 But he denied it, and said,  "I don't know--I don't understand--What do you mean?" And then he went out into the outer court.  Just then a cock crowed.
24824	41	14	69	 Again the maidservant saw him, and again began to say to the people standing by, "He is one of them."
24825	41	14	70	 A second time he repeatedly denied it. Soon afterwards the bystanders again accused Peter, saying, "You are surely one of them, for you too are a Galilaean."
24826	41	14	71	 But he broke out into curses and oaths, declaring, "I know nothing of the man you are talking about."
24827	41	14	72	 No sooner had he spoken than a cock crowed for the second time, and Peter recollected the words of Jesus, "Before the cock crows twice, you will three times disown me." And as he thought of it, he  wept aloud.
24828	41	15	1	 At earliest dawn, after the High Priests had held a consultation with the Elders and Scribes, they and the entire Sanhedrin bound Jesus and took Him away and handed Him over to Pilate.
24829	41	15	2	  So Pilate questioned Him. "Are *you* the King of the Jews?" he asked. "I am," replied Jesus.
24830	41	15	3	 Then, as the High Priests went on heaping accusations on Him,
24831	41	15	4	 Pilate again and again asked Him, "Do you make no reply? Listen to the many charges they are bringing against you."
24832	41	15	5	 But Jesus made no further answer: so that Pilate wondered.
24833	41	15	6	  Now at the Festival it was customary for Pilate to release to the Jews any one prisoner whom they might beg off from punishment;
24834	41	15	7	 and at this time a man named Barabbas was in prison among the insurgents--persons who in the insurrection had committed murder.
24835	41	15	8	 So the people came crowding up, asking Pilate to grant them the usual favour.
24836	41	15	9	 "Shall I release for you the King of the Jews?" answered Pilate.
24837	41	15	10	 For he could see that it was out of sheer spite that the High Priests had handed Him over.
24838	41	15	11	 But the High Priests urged on the crowd to obtain Barabbas's release in preference;
24839	41	15	12	 and when Pilate again asked them, "What then shall I do to the man you call King of the Jews?"
24840	41	15	13	 they once more shouted out, "Crucify Him!"
24841	41	15	14	  "Why, what crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they vehemently shouted, "Crucify Him!"
24842	41	15	15	 So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the mob, released Barabbas for them, and after scourging Jesus handed Him over for crucifixion.
24843	41	15	16	  Then the soldiers led Him away into the court of the Palace (the Praetorium), and calling together the whole battalion
24844	41	15	17	 they arrayed Him in crimson, placed on His head a wreath of thorny twigs which they had twisted,
24845	41	15	18	 and went on to salute Him with shouts of "Long live the King of the Jews."
24846	41	15	19	 Then they began to beat Him on the head with a  cane, to spit on Him, and to do Him homage on bended knees.
24847	41	15	20	 At last, having finished their sport, they took the robe off Him, put His own clothes on Him, and led Him out to crucify Him.
24848	41	15	21	  One Simon, a Cyrenaean, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing along, coming from the country: him they compelled to carry His cross.
24849	41	15	22	 So they brought Him to the place called Golgotha, which, being translated, means `Skull-ground.'
24850	41	15	23	 Here they offered Him wine mixed with myrrh; but He refused it.
24851	41	15	24	  Then they crucified Him. This done, they divided His garments among them, drawing lots to decide what each should take.
24852	41	15	25	 It was nine o'clock in the morning when they crucified Him.
24853	41	15	26	 Over His head was the notice in writing of the charge against Him: THE KING OF THE JEWS.
24854	41	15	27	 And together with Jesus they crucified two robbers, one at His right hand and one at His left.
24855	41	15	28	  []
24856	41	15	29	  And all the passers-by reviled Him. They shook their heads at Him and said, "Ah! you who were for destroying the Sanctuary and building a new one in three days,
24857	41	15	30	 come down from the cross and save yourself."
24858	41	15	31	 In the same way the High Priests also, as well as the Scribes, kept on scoffing at Him, saying to one another, "He has  saved others:  himself he cannot save!
24859	41	15	32	 This Christ, the King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe." Even the men who were being crucified with Him heaped insults on Him.
24860	41	15	33	  At noon there came a darkness over the whole land, lasting till three o'clock in the afternoon.
24861	41	15	34	 But at three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice, <"Elohi, Elohi, lama sabachthani?"> which means, "My God, My God, <why hast Thou forsaken me?">
24862	41	15	35	 Some of the bystanders, hearing Him, said, "Listen, he is calling for Elijah!"
24863	41	15	36	 Then a man ran to fill a sponge with  sour wine, and he put it on the end of a cane and placed it to His lips, saying at the same time, "Wait! let us see whether Elijah will come and take him down."
24864	41	15	37	 But Jesus uttered a loud cry and yielded up His spirit.
24865	41	15	38	  And the curtain in the Sanctuary  was torn in two, from top to bottom.
24866	41	15	39	 And when the  Centurion who stood in front of the cross saw that He was dead, he exclaimed, "This man was indeed God's Son."
24867	41	15	40	 There were also a party of women looking on from a distance; among them being both Mary of Magdala and Mary the mother of James the Little and of Joses, and Salome--
24868	41	15	41	 all of whom in the Galilaean days  had habitually been with Him and cared for Him, as well as many other women who had come up to Jerusalem with Him.
24869	41	15	42	  Towards sunset, as it was the Preparation--that is, the day preceding the Sabbath--
24870	41	15	43	 Joseph of Arimathaea came, a  highly respected member of the  Council, who himself also was living in expectation of the Kingdom of God. He summoned up courage to go in to see Pilate and beg for the body of Jesus.
24871	41	15	44	 But Pilate could hardly believe that He was already dead. He called, however, for the Centurion and inquired whether He had been long dead;
24872	41	15	45	 and having ascertained the fact he granted the body to Joseph.
24873	41	15	46	 He, having bought a sheet of linen, took Him down, wrapped Him in the sheet and laid Him in a tomb hewn in the rock; after which he rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb.
24874	41	15	47	 Mary of Magdala and Mary the mother of Joses were looking on to see where He was put.
24875	41	16	1	  When the Sabbath was over, Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, in order to come and anoint  His body.
24876	41	16	2	 So, very soon after sunrise on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb;
24877	41	16	3	 and they were saying to one another, `Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?"
24878	41	16	4	 But then, looking up, they saw that the stone was already rolled back:  for it was of immense size.
24879	41	16	5	  Upon entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting at their right hand, clothed in a long white robe. They were astonished and terrified.
24880	41	16	6	 But he said to them, "Do not be terrified. It is Jesus you are looking for--the Nazarene who has been crucified. He has  come back to life: He is not here: this is the place where they laid Him.
24881	41	16	7	 But go and tell His disciples and Peter that He is going before you into Galilee: and that there you will see Him, as He told you."
24882	41	16	8	  So they came out, and fled from the tomb, for they were greatly agitated and surprised; and they said not a word to any one, for they were afraid.
24883	41	16	9	  [But He rose to life early on the first day of the week, and appeared first to Mary of Magdala from whom He had expelled seven demons.
24884	41	16	10	 She went and brought the tidings to those who had been with Him, as they were mourning and weeping.
24885	41	16	11	 But they, when they were told that He was alive and that she had seen Him, could not believe it.
24886	41	16	12	  Afterwards He showed Himself in another form to two of them as they were walking, on their way into the country.
24887	41	16	13	 These, again, went and told the news to the rest; but not even them did they believe.
24888	41	16	14	  Later still He showed Himself to the Eleven themselves whilst they were at table, and He upbraided them with their unbelief and obstinacy in not having believed those who had seen Him alive.
24889	41	16	15	  Then He said to them, "Go the whole world over, and proclaim the Good News to all  mankind.
24890	41	16	16	 He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who disbelieves will be condemned.
24891	41	16	17	 And signs shall attend those who believe, even such as these. By making use of my name they shall expel demons. They shall speak  new languages.
24892	41	16	18	 They shall take up venomous snakes, and if they drink any deadly poison it shall do them no harm whatever. They shall lay their hands on the sick, and the sick shall recover."
24893	41	16	19	  So the Lord  Jesus after having thus spoken to them was taken up into Heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.
24894	41	16	20	 But they went out and made proclamation everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming their Message by the signs which accompanied it.]
24895	42	1	1	 Seeing that many have attempted to draw up a narrative of the facts which are  received with full assurance among us
24896	42	1	2	 on the authority of those who were from the beginning eye-witnesses and were devoted to  the service of the divine Message,
24897	42	1	3	 it has seemed right to me also, after careful investigation of the facts from their commencement, to write for you, most noble Theophilus, a connected account,
24898	42	1	4	 that you may fully know the truth of the things which you have been taught by word of mouth.
24899	42	1	5	 There was in the time of Herod, the king of Judaea, a priest of the name of  Zechariah, belonging to the class of  Abijah. He had a wife who was a descendant of Aaron, and her name was  Elizabeth.
24900	42	1	6	 They were both of them upright before God, blamelessly obeying all the Lord's precepts and ordinances.
24901	42	1	7	 But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren; and both of them were far advanced in life.
24902	42	1	8	 Now while he was doing priestly duty before God in the prescribed course of his class,
24903	42	1	9	 it fell to his lot--according to the custom of the priesthood--to go into the Sanctuary of the Lord and burn the incense;
24904	42	1	10	 and the whole multitude of the people were outside praying, at the hour of incense.
24905	42	1	11	 Then there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense;
24906	42	1	12	 and Zechariah on seeing him was  agitated and terrified.
24907	42	1	13	 But the angel said to him,  "Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your petition has been heard: and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call his name John.
24908	42	1	14	 Gladness and exultant joy shall be yours, and many will rejoice over his birth.
24909	42	1	15	 For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; no wine or fermented drink shall he ever drink; but he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth.
24910	42	1	16	 Many of the descendants of Israel will he turn to the Lord their God;
24911	42	1	17	 and he will be His forerunner in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn fathers' hearts to the children, and cause the rebellious to walk in the wisdom of the upright, to make a people perfectly ready for the lord."
24912	42	1	18	 "By what proof," asked Zechariah, "shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is far advanced in years."
24913	42	1	19	 "I am Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God," answered the angel, "and I have been sent to talk with you and tell you this good news.
24914	42	1	20	 And now you will be dumb and unable to speak until the day when this has taken place; because you did not believe my words--words which will be fulfilled at their appointed time."
24915	42	1	21	 Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah, and were surprised that he stayed so long in the Sanctuary.
24916	42	1	22	 When, however, he came out, he was unable to speak to them; and they knew that he must have seen a vision in the Sanctuary; but he kept making signs to them and continued dumb.
24917	42	1	23	 When his days of service were at an end, he went to his home;
24918	42	1	24	 and in course of time his wife Elizabeth conceived, and kept herself secluded five months.
24919	42	1	25	 "Thus has the Lord dealt with me," she said, "now that He has  graciously taken away my reproach among men."
24920	42	1	26	 Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee called  Nazareth,
24921	42	1	27	 to a maiden betrothed to a man of the name of Joseph, a descendant of David. The maiden's name was  Mary.
24922	42	1	28	 So Gabriel went into the house and said to her, "Joy be to you, favoured one! the Lord is  with you."
24923	42	1	29	 She was greatly  agitated at his words, and wondered what such a greeting meant.
24924	42	1	30	 But the angel said,  "Do not be frightened, Mary, for you have found favour with God.
24925	42	1	31	 You will conceive in your womb and bear a son; and you are to call His name  JESUS.
24926	42	1	32	 He will be great and He will be called `Son of the Most High.' And the Lord God will give Him the throne of His forefather David;
24927	42	1	33	 and He will be King over the House of Jacob for the Ages, and of His Kingdom there will be no end."
24928	42	1	34	 "How can this be," Mary replied, "seeing that I have no husband?"
24929	42	1	35	 The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for this reason your holy  offspring will be called `the Son of God.'
24930	42	1	36	 And see, your relative Elizabeth--she also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.
24931	42	1	37	 For no promise from God will be  impossible of fulfilment."
24932	42	1	38	 "I am the Lord's  maidservant," Mary replied; "may it be with me in accordance with your words!" And then the angel left her.
24933	42	1	39	  Not long after this, Mary rose up and went  in haste into the hill country to a town in Judah.
24934	42	1	40	 Here she came to the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth;
24935	42	1	41	 and as soon as Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the babe leapt within her. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,
24936	42	1	42	 and uttered a loud  cry of joy.  "Blest among women are you," she said, "and the offspring of your body is blest!
24937	42	1	43	 But why is this honour done me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
24938	42	1	44	 For, the moment your greeting reached my ears, the babe within me leapt for joy.
24939	42	1	45	 And blessed is she  who has believed,  for the word spoken to her from the Lord shall be fulfilled."
24940	42	1	46	 Then Mary said: "My soul extols the Lord,
24941	42	1	47	 And my spirit  triumphs in God my  Saviour;
24942	42	1	48	 Because He has not turned from His maidservant in her lowly position; For from this time forward all generations will account me happy,
24943	42	1	49	 Because the mighty One has done great things for me--Holy is His name!--
24944	42	1	50	 And His compassion is, generation after generation, Upon those who fear Him.
24945	42	1	51	 He  has manifested His supreme strength. He has scattered those who were haughty in the thoughts of their hearts.
24946	42	1	52	 He has cast monarchs down from their thrones, And exalted men of low estate.
24947	42	1	53	 The hungry He has satisfied with choice gifts, But the rich He has sent empty-handed away.
24948	42	1	54	 His servant Israel He has helped,  Remembering His compassion--
24949	42	1	55	 In fulfillment of His promises to our forefathers--For Abraham and his posterity for ever."
24950	42	1	56	 So Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months, and then returned home.
24951	42	1	57	 Now when Elizabeth's full time was come, she gave birth to a son;
24952	42	1	58	 and her neighbours and relatives heard how the Lord  had had great compassion on her; and they rejoiced with her.
24953	42	1	59	 And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and were going to call him Zechariah, after his father.
24954	42	1	60	 His mother, however, said, "No, he is to be called John."
24955	42	1	61	 "There is not one of your family," they said, "who has that name."
24956	42	1	62	 They asked his father by signs what he wished him to be called.
24957	42	1	63	 So he asked for a writing-tablet, and wrote, "His name is John." And they all wondered.
24958	42	1	64	 Instantly his mouth and his tongue were set free, and he began to speak and bless God.
24959	42	1	65	 And all who lived round about them were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judaea reports of all these things were spread abroad.
24960	42	1	66	 All who heard the story treasured it in their memories. "What then will this child be?" they said. For the lord's hand was indeed with him.
24961	42	1	67	 And Zechariah his father was filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke in a rapture of praise.
24962	42	1	68	 "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel," he said, "Because He  has not forgotten His people but has effected redemption for them,
24963	42	1	69	 And has raised up  a mighty Deliverer for us In the house of David His servant--
24964	42	1	70	 As He has spoken  from all time by the lips of His holy Prophets--
24965	42	1	71	  To deliver us from our foes and from the power of all who hate us.
24966	42	1	72	 He dealt pitifully with our forefathers, And remembered His holy covenant,
24967	42	1	73	 The oath which He swore to Abraham our forefather,
24968	42	1	74	 To grant us to be rescued from the power of our foes And so render worship to Him free from fear,
24969	42	1	75	 In  piety and uprightness before Him all our days.
24970	42	1	76	 And you moreover, O child, shall be called Prophet of the Most High; For you shall go on in front before the Lord to prepare the way for Him,
24971	42	1	77	 To give to His People a knowledge of  salvation In the forgiveness of their sins,
24972	42	1	78	 Through the tender compassion of our God, Through which the daybreak from on high  will come to us,
24973	42	1	79	  Dawning on those who now  dwell in the darkness and shadow of death--To direct our feet into the path of peace."
24974	42	1	80	 And the child grew and became strong in character, and lived in the  Desert till the time came for him to appear publicly to Israel.
24975	42	2	1	 Just at this time an edict was issued by Caesar Augustus for the  registration of  the whole Empire.
24976	42	2	2	 It was the first registration made during the governorship of Quirinius in Syria;
24977	42	2	3	 and all went to be registered--every one to the town to which he belonged.
24978	42	2	4	 So Joseph went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judaea, to David's town of Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,
24979	42	2	5	 to have himself registered together with Mary, who was betrothed to him and was with child.
24980	42	2	6	 But while they were there, her full time came,
24981	42	2	7	 and she gave birth to her first-born son, and wrapped Him round, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the  inn.
24982	42	2	8	 Now there were shepherds in the same part of the country, keeping watch over their sheep by night  in the open fields,
24983	42	2	9	 when suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round them; and they were filled with terror.
24984	42	2	10	 But the angel said to them, "Put away all fear; for I am bringing you good news of great joy--joy for all the People.
24985	42	2	11	 For a  Saviour who is the Anointed Lord is born to you to-day, in the town of David.
24986	42	2	12	 And this is the token for you: you will find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger."
24987	42	2	13	 And immediately there was with the angel a multitude of the army of Heaven praising God and saying,
24988	42	2	14	 "Glory be to God in the highest Heavens, And on earth peace among  men who please Him!"
24989	42	2	15	 Then, as soon as the angels had left them and returned to Heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let us now go over as far as Bethlehem and see this that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us."
24990	42	2	16	 So they made haste and came and found Mary and Joseph, with the babe lying in the manger.
24991	42	2	17	 And when they saw the child, they told what had been said to them about Him;
24992	42	2	18	 and all who listened were astonished at what the shepherds told them.
24993	42	2	19	 But Mary treasured up all these things, often dwelling on them in her mind.
24994	42	2	20	 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen in accordance with the announcement made to them.
24995	42	2	21	 When eight days had passed and the time for circumcising Him had come, He was called JESUS, the name given Him by the angel before His conception in the womb.
24996	42	2	22	 And when the days for their purification appointed by the Law of Moses had passed, they took Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord--
24997	42	2	23	 as it is written in the Law of the Lord: <"Every first-born male shall be called holy to the Lord.">
24998	42	2	23	 During the passage He fell asleep, and there came down a squall of wind on the Lake, so that  the boat began to fill and they were in deadly peril.
24999	42	2	24	 And they also offered a sacrifice as commanded in the Law of the Lord, <"a pair of  turtle doves or two young pigeons.">
25000	42	2	25	 Now there was a man in Jerusalem of the name of Symeon, an upright and God-fearing man, who was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
25001	42	2	26	 To him it had been revealed by the Holy Spirit that he should  not see death until he had seen the Lord's Anointed One.
25002	42	2	27	  Led by the Spirit he came to the Temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do with regard to Him according to the custom of the Law,
25003	42	2	28	 he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said,
25004	42	2	29	 "Now, O Sovereign Lord, Thou dost send Thy servant away in peace, in fulfilment of Thy word,
25005	42	2	30	 Because mine eyes have seen Thy salvation,
25006	42	2	31	 Which Thou hast made ready in the sight of all nations--
25007	42	2	32	 A light  to shine upon the Gentiles, And the glory of Thy people Israel."
25008	42	2	33	 And while the child's father and mother were wondering at the words of Symeon concerning Him,
25009	42	2	34	 Symeon blessed them and said to Mary the mother, "This child  is appointed for the falling and the  uprising of many in Israel and for a token to be spoken against;
25010	42	2	35	 and a sword will pierce through your own soul also; that the reasonings  in many hearts may be  revealed."
25011	42	2	36	 There was also  Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, belonging to the tribe of Asher. She was of a very great age, having had after her maidenhood seven years of married life,
25012	42	2	37	 and then being a widow  of eighty-four years. She was never absent from the Temple, but worshipped, by day and by night, with fasting and prayer.
25013	42	2	38	 And coming up just at that moment, she gave thanks to God, and spoke about the child to all who were expecting the  deliverance of Jerusalem.
25014	42	2	39	 Then, as soon as they had accomplished all that the Law required, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.
25015	42	2	40	 And the child grew and became strong and full of wisdom, and the favour of God rested upon Him.
25016	42	2	41	 Now His parents used to go up year by year to Jerusalem at the Feast of the Passover.
25017	42	2	42	 And when He was twelve years old they went up as was customary at the time of the Feast, and,
25018	42	2	43	 after staying the full number of days, when they started back home the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not discover this,
25019	42	2	44	 but supposing Him to be in the travelling company, they proceeded a day's journey. Then they searched up and down for Him among their relatives and acquaintances;
25020	42	2	45	 but being unable to find Him they returned to Jerusalem, making anxious inquiry for Him.
25021	42	2	46	  On the third day they found Him in  the Temple sitting among the  Rabbis, both listening to them and asking them  questions,
25022	42	2	47	 while all who heard Him were astonished at His intelligence and at  the answers He gave.
25023	42	2	48	 When they saw Him, they were smitten with amazement, and His mother said to Him, "My child, why have you behaved thus to us? Your father and I have been searching for you in anguish."
25024	42	2	49	 "Why is it that you have been searching for me?" He replied; "did you not know that it is my duty  to be engaged upon my Father's business?"
25025	42	2	50	 But they did not understand the significance of these words.
25026	42	2	51	 Then He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was always obedient to them; but His mother carefully treasured up all these  incidents in her memory.
25027	42	2	52	 And as Jesus grew older He gained in both wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.
25028	42	3	1	  Now in the fifteenth year of the  reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being Governor of Judaea, Herod Tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip Tetrarch of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias Tetrarch of Abilene,
25029	42	3	2	 during the High-priesthood of  Annas and Caiaphas, a message from God came  to John, the son of Zechariah, in the Desert.
25030	42	3	3	 John went into all the district about the Jordan proclaiming a baptism  of the penitent for the forgiveness of sins;
25031	42	3	4	 as it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah, <"The voice of one crying aloud! `In the Desert prepare ye a road for the Lord: make His highway straight.
25032	42	3	5	 Every ravine shall be filled up, and every mountain and hill levelled down, the crooked places shall be turned into straight roads, and the rugged ways into smooth;
25033	42	3	6	 and then shall all mankind see God's salvation.'">
25034	42	3	7	 Accordingly John used to say to the crowds who came out to be baptized by him, "O vipers'  brood, who has  warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
25035	42	3	8	 Live lives which shall prove your change of heart; and do not begin to say to yourselves, `We have Abraham as our forefather,' for I tell you that God can  raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones.
25036	42	3	9	 And even now the axe is lying at the root of the trees, so that every tree  which fails to yield good fruit will quickly be hewn down and thrown into the fire."
25037	42	3	10	 The crowds repeatedly asked him, "What then are we to do?"
25038	42	3	11	 "Let the man who has two  coats," he answered, "give one to the man who has none; and let the man who has food share it with others."
25039	42	3	12	 There came also a party of tax-gatherers to be baptized, and they asked him,  "Rabbi, what are we to do?"
25040	42	3	13	 "Do not exact more than the legal amount," he replied.
25041	42	3	14	 The soldiers also once and again inquired of him, "And we, what are we to do?" His answer was, "Neither intimidate any one nor lay false charges; and be content with your pay."
25042	42	3	15	  And while the people were in suspense and all were debating in their minds whether John might possibly be the Anointed One,
25043	42	3	16	 he answered the question by saying to them all, "As for me, I am baptizing you with water, but One mightier than I is coming, whose very sandal-strap I am not worthy to unfasten: He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and with fire.
25044	42	3	17	 His winnowing-shovel is in His hand to clear out His threshing-floor, and to gather the wheat into His storehouse; but the chaff He will burn up in fire unquenchable."
25045	42	3	18	 With many exhortations besides these he declared the Good News to the people.
25046	42	3	19	  But Herod the Tetrarch, being repeatedly rebuked by him about Herodias his brother's wife, and about all the wicked deeds that he had done,
25047	42	3	20	 now added this to crown all the rest, that he threw John into prison.
25048	42	3	21	  Now when  all the people  had been baptized, and Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the sky opened,
25049	42	3	22	 and the Holy Spirit came down in bodily shape, like a dove, upon Him, and a voice came from Heaven, which said, "Thou art My Son, dearly loved: in Thee  is My delight."
25050	42	3	23	 And  He--Jesus--when He began His ministry, was about thirty years old. He was  the son (it was supposed) of Joseph, son of Heli,
25051	42	3	24	 son of Matthat, son of Levi, son of Melchi, son of Jannai, son of Joseph,
25052	42	3	25	 son of Mattathias, son of Amos, son of Nahum, son of Esli, son of Naggai,
25053	42	3	26	 son of Mahath, son of Mattathias, son of Semein, son of Josech, son of Joda,
25054	42	3	27	 son of Johanan, son of Resa, son of Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, son of Neri,
25055	42	3	28	 son of Melchi, son of Addi, son of Cosam, son of Elmadam, son of Er,
25056	42	3	29	 son of Joshua, son of Eliezar, son of Jorim, son of Maththat, son of Levi,
25057	42	3	30	 son of Symeon, son of Judah, son of Joseph, son of Jonam, son of Eliakim, son of
25058	42	3	31	 Melea, son of Menna, son of Mattatha, son of Nathan, son of David,
25059	42	3	32	 son of Jesse, son of Obed, son of Boaz, son of Salmon, son of Nahshon,
25060	42	3	33	 son of Amminadab,  son of Admin, son of Arni, son of Hezron, son of Perez, son of Judah,
25061	42	3	34	 son of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham, son of Terah, son of Nahor,
25062	42	3	35	 son of Serug, son of Reu, son of Peleg, son of Eber, son of Shelah,
25063	42	3	36	 son of Cainan, son of Arpachshad, son of Shem, son of Noah, son of Lamech,
25064	42	3	37	 son of Methuselah, son of Enoch, son of Jared, son of Mahalalel, son of Kenan,
25065	42	3	38	 son of Enosh, son of Seth, son of Adam, son of God.
25066	42	4	1	  Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led about  by the Spirit in the Desert for forty days,
25067	42	4	2	 tempted all the while by the Devil. During those days He ate nothing, and at the close of them He suffered from hunger.
25068	42	4	3	 Then the Devil said to Him,  "If you are God's Son, tell this stone to become bread."
25069	42	4	4	 "It is written," replied Jesus, <"`It is not on bread alone that a man shall live.'">
25070	42	4	5	 The Devil next led Him up and caused Him to see  at a glance all the kingdoms of the world.
25071	42	4	6	 And the Devil said to Him, "To you will I give all this authority and  this splendour; for it has been handed over to me, and on whomsoever I will I bestow it.
25072	42	4	7	 If therefore you do homage to me, it shall all be yours.'
25073	42	4	8	 Jesus answered him, "It is written, <`To the Lord thy God thou shalt do homage, and to Him alone shalt thou render worship.'">
25074	42	4	9	 Then he brought Him to Jerusalem and caused Him to stand on the roof of the Temple, and said to Him, "If you are God's Son, throw yourself down from here; for it is written,
25075	42	4	10	 <`He will give orders to His angels concerning thee, to guard thee safely;'>
25076	42	4	11	 and <`On their hands they shall bear thee up, Lest at any moment thou shouldst strike thy foot against a stone.'">
25077	42	4	12	 The reply of Jesus was, "It is said, <`Thou shalt not put the Lord they God to the proof.'">
25078	42	4	13	 So the Devil, having  fully tried  every kind of temptation on Him, left Him  for a time.
25079	42	4	14	  Then Jesus returned in the Spirit's power to Galilee; and His fame spread through all the adjacent districts.
25080	42	4	15	 And  He proceeded to teach in their synagogues, winning praise from all.
25081	42	4	16	 He came to Nazareth also, where He had been brought up; and, as was His custom, He went to the synagogue on the Sabbath, and stood up to read.
25082	42	4	17	 And there was handed to Him the  book of the Prophet Isaiah, and, opening the book, He found the place where it was written,
25083	42	4	18	 <"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me to proclaim Good News to the poor; He has sent me to announce release to the prisoners of war and recovery of sight to the blind: to send away free those whom tyranny has crushed,
25084	42	4	19	 to proclaim the year of acceptance with the Lord.">
25085	42	4	20	 And rolling up the book, He returned it to the attendant, and  sat down--to speak. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him.
25086	42	4	21	 Then He proceeded to say to them, "To-day is this Scripture fulfilled in your hearing."
25087	42	4	22	 And they all  spoke well of Him, wondering at the  sweet words of kindness which fell from His lips, while they asked one another, "Is not this Joseph's son?"
25088	42	4	23	 "Doubtless," said He, "you will quote to me the proverb, `Physician, cure yourself: all that we hear that you have done  at Capernaum, do here also in your native place.'"
25089	42	4	24	 "I tell you  in solemn truth," He added, "that no Prophet is welcomed among his own people.
25090	42	4	25	 But I tell you in truth that there was many a widow in Israel in the time of Elijah, when  there was no rain for three years and six months and there came a severe famine over all the land;
25091	42	4	26	 and yet to not one of them was Elijah sent:  he was only sent to a widow at Zarephath in the Sidonian country.
25092	42	4	27	 And there was also many a leper in Israel in the time of the Prophet Elisha, and yet not one of them was cleansed, but Naaman the Syrian was."
25093	42	4	28	 Then all in the synagogue, while listening to these words, were filled with fury.
25094	42	4	29	 They rose, hurried Him outside the town, and brought Him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, to throw Him down the cliff;
25095	42	4	30	 but He passed through the midst of them and went His way.
25096	42	4	31	  So He came down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, where He frequently taught the people on the Sabbath days.
25097	42	4	32	 And they were greatly impressed by His teaching, because He spoke with the language of authority.
25098	42	4	33	 But in the synagogue there was a man  possessed by the spirit of a foul demon. In a loud voice he cried out,
25099	42	4	34	 "Ha! Jesus the Nazarene, what have you to do with us? I know who you are--God's Holy One!"
25100	42	4	35	 But Jesus rebuked the demon. "Silence!" He exclaimed; "come out of him." Upon this, the demon hurled the man into the midst of them, and came out of him without doing him any harm.
25101	42	4	36	 All were astonished and awe-struck; and they asked one another, "What sort of language is this? For with authority and real power He gives orders to the foul spirits and they come out."
25102	42	4	37	 And the talk about Him spread into every part of the neighbouring country.
25103	42	4	38	  Now when He rose and left the synagogue He went to Simon's house. Simon's mother-in-law was  suffering from an acute attack of fever; and they consulted Him about her.
25104	42	4	39	 Then standing over her He  rebuked the fever, and it left her; and she at once rose and waited on them.
25105	42	4	40	 At sunset all who had friends suffering from any illness brought them to Him, and He laid His hands on them all, one by one, and cured them.
25106	42	4	41	 Demons also came out of many, loudly calling out, "You are the Son of God." But He rebuked them and forbad them to speak, because they knew Him to be  the Christ.
25107	42	4	42	  Next morning, at daybreak, He left the town and went away to a solitary place; but the people flocked out to find Him, and, coming to the place where He was, they endeavoured to detain Him that He might not leave them.
25108	42	4	43	 But He said to them, "I have to tell the Good News of the Kingdom of God to the other towns also, because for this purpose I was sent."
25109	42	4	44	 And  for some time He preached in the synagogues in  Galilee.
25110	42	5	1	 On one occasion the crowd was pressing on Him and listening to God's Message, while He was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret.
25111	42	5	2	 He, however, saw two fishing-boats drawn up on the beach (for the men had gone away from them and were washing the nets),
25112	42	5	3	 and going on board one of them, which was Simon's He asked him to push out a little from land. Then He sat down and taught the crowd of people from the boat.
25113	42	5	4	 When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon,  "Push out into deep water, and  let down your nets for a haul."
25114	42	5	5	  "Rabbi," replied Peter, "all night long we have worked hard and caught nothing; but at your command I will let down the nets."
25115	42	5	6	 This they did, and enclosed a vast number of fish; and their nets began to break.
25116	42	5	7	 So they signalled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them; they came, and they filled both the boats so that they almost sank.
25117	42	5	8	 When Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at the knees of Jesus, and exclaimed, "Master,  leave my boat, for I am a sinful man."
25118	42	5	9	 (For he was  astonished and terrified--he and all his companions--at the haul of fish which they had taken;
25119	42	5	10	 and so were Simon's partners James and John, the sons of Zabdi.) But Jesus replied to Simon, "Fear not: from this time you shall be a catcher of men."
25120	42	5	11	 Then, after bringing their boats to land, they left everything and followed Him.
25121	42	5	12	  On another occasion, when He was in one of the towns, there was a man there covered with leprosy, who, seeing Jesus, threw himself at His feet and implored Him, saying, "Sir, if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean."
25122	42	5	13	 Reaching out His hand and touching him, Jesus said, "I am willing; be cleansed!" And instantly the leprosy left him.
25123	42	5	14	 He ordered him to tell no one. "But go," He said, "show yourself to the Priest, and make the offering for your purification which Moses appointed, as evidence for them."
25124	42	5	15	 But all the more the report about Him spread abroad, and great multitudes crowded to hear Him and to be cured of their diseases;
25125	42	5	16	 but Jesus Himself constantly withdrew into the Desert and there prayed.
25126	42	5	17	  One day He was teaching, and there were Pharisees and teachers of the Law  sitting there who had come from every village in Galilee and Judaea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present  for Him to cure people.
25127	42	5	18	 And a party of men came carrying a palsied man on a bed, and they endeavoured to bring him in and lay him before Jesus.
25128	42	5	19	 But when they could find no way of doing so because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down through the tiling--bed and all--into the midst, in front of Jesus.
25129	42	5	20	 He saw their faith and said to him,  "Friend, your sins are  forgiven."
25130	42	5	21	 Then the Scribes and Pharisees began to cavil, asking, "Who is  this, uttering blasphemies? Who but God alone can forgive sins?"
25131	42	5	22	 Well aware of their reasonings, Jesus answered their questions by asking in turn,  "What is this that you are debating in your hearts?
25132	42	5	23	 Which is easier? --to say, `Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, `Rise and walk'?
25133	42	5	24	 But to prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins" --Turning to the paralytic He said, "I bid you, Rise, take up your bed, and go home."
25134	42	5	25	 Instantly he stood up in their presence, took up the mattress on which he had been lying, and went away to his home, giving glory to God.
25135	42	5	26	  Amazement seized them all. "Glory to God!" was the abiding feeling. Yet fear flashed through their minds and they said, "We have seen strange things to-day."
25136	42	5	27	  After this He went out and noticed a tax-gatherer, Levi by name, sitting at the Toll office; and He said to him, "Follow me."
25137	42	5	28	 He rose, left everything, and followed Him.
25138	42	5	29	 Levi also gave a great entertainment at his house in honour of Jesus, and there was a large party of tax-gatherers and others at table with them.
25139	42	5	30	 This led the Pharisees and Scribes of their party to expostulate with His disciples and ask, "Why are you eating and drinking with these tax-gatherers and notorious sinners?"
25140	42	5	31	 But Jesus replied to them, "It is not men in good health who require a physician, but the sick.
25141	42	5	32	 I have not come to call the righteous to repentance, but sinners."
25142	42	5	33	  Again they said to Him, "John's disciples fast often and pray, as do also those of the pharisees; but yours eat and drink."
25143	42	5	34	 "Can you compel the bridal party to fast," replied Jesus, "so long as they have the bridegroom among them?
25144	42	5	35	 But a time for this will come, when the Bridegroom has been taken away from them: then, at that time, they will fast."
25145	42	5	36	 He also spoke in figurative language to them. "No one," He said, "tears a piece from a new garment to mend an old one. Otherwise he would not only spoil the new, but the patch from the new would not match the old.
25146	42	5	37	 Nor does any one pour new wine into old wine-skins. Otherwise the new wine would burst the skins, the wine itself would be spilt, and the skins be destroyed.
25147	42	5	38	 But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.
25148	42	5	39	 Nor does any one after drinking old wine wish for new; for he says, `The old is  better.'"
25149	42	6	1	  Now on the  second-first Sabbath while He was passing through the wheatfields, His disciples were plucking the ears and rubbing them with their hands to eat the grain.
25150	42	6	2	 And some of the Pharisees asked, "Why are you doing what the Law forbids on the Sabbath?"
25151	42	6	3	 "Have you  never read so much as this," answered Jesus--"what David did when he and his followers were hungry;
25152	42	6	4	 how he entered the house of God and took and ate the Presented Loaves and gave some to his followers--loaves which none but the Priests are allowed to eat?"
25153	42	6	5	 "The Son of Man," He added, "is Lord of the Sabbath  also."
25154	42	6	6	  On another Sabbath He had gone to the synagogue and was teaching there; and in the congregation was a man whose right arm was withered.
25155	42	6	7	 The Scribes and the Pharisees were on the watch to see whether He would cure him on the Sabbath that they might be able to bring an accusation against Him.
25156	42	6	8	 He knew their thoughts, and said to the man with the withered arm, "Rise, and  stand there in the middle." And he rose and stood there.
25157	42	6	9	 Then Jesus said to them, "I put it to you all whether we are allowed to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil; to save a life, or to destroy it."
25158	42	6	10	 And looking round upon them all He said to the man, "Stretch out your arm." He did so, and the arm was restored.
25159	42	6	11	 But they were filled with madness, and began to discuss with one another what they should do to Jesus.
25160	42	6	12	  About that time He went out on one occasion into the  hill country to pray; and He remained all night in  prayer to God.
25161	42	6	13	 When it was day, He called His disciples; and He selected from among them twelve, whom He also named Apostles.
25162	42	6	14	  These were Simon, to whom also He  had given the name of Peter, and Andrew his brother; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew;
25163	42	6	15	 Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus and Simon called the Zealot;
25164	42	6	16	  James's relative Judas, and Judas Iscariot who proved to be a traitor.
25165	42	6	17	 With these He came down  till He reached a level place, where there was a great crowd of His disciples, and a multitude of people from every part of Judaea, from Jerusalem, and from the sea-side district of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear Him and to be cured of their diseases;
25166	42	6	18	 and those who were tormented by foul spirits were cured.
25167	42	6	19	 The whole crowd were eager to touch Him, because power went forth from him and cured every one.
25168	42	6	20	  Then fixing His eyes upon His disciples, Jesus said to them, "Blessed are you poor, because the Kingdom of God is yours.
25169	42	6	21	 "Blessed are you who hunger now, because your hunger shall be satisfied. "Blessed are you who now weep aloud, because you shall laugh.
25170	42	6	22	  "Blessed are you when men shall hate you and exclude you from their society and insult you, and spurn your very names as evil things, for the Son of Man's sake.
25171	42	6	23	 "Be glad at such a time, and dance for joy; for your reward is great in Heaven; for that is just the way their forefathers behaved to the Prophets!
25172	42	6	24	 "But  alas for you rich men, because you already have your consolation!
25173	42	6	25	 "Alas for you who now have plenty to eat, because you will be hungry! "Alas for you who laugh now, because you will mourn and weep aloud!
25174	42	6	26	 "Alas for you when men shall all have spoken well of you; for that is just the way their forefathers behaved to the false Prophets!
25175	42	6	27	  "But to you who are listening to me I say, Love your enemies; seek the welfare of those who hate you;
25176	42	6	28	 bless those who curse you; pray for those who revile you.
25177	42	6	29	 To him who gives you a blow on one side of the face offer the other side also; and to him who is robbing you of your outer garment refuse not the under one also.
25178	42	6	30	 To every one who asks, give; and from him who takes away your property, do not demand it back.
25179	42	6	31	  And behave to your fellow men just as you would have them behave to you.
25180	42	6	32	  "If you love those who love you, what credit is it to you? Why, even bad men love those who love them.
25181	42	6	33	 And if you are  kind to those who are kind to you, what credit is it to you?  Even bad men act thus.
25182	42	6	34	 And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is it to you? Even bad men lend to their fellows so as to receive back an equal amount.
25183	42	6	35	 Nevertheless love your enemies, be beneficent; and lend without hoping for any repayment. Then your recompense shall be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for He is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.
25184	42	6	36	 Be compassionate just as your Father is compassionate.
25185	42	6	37	  "Judge not, and you shall not be judged; condemn not, and you shall not be condemned;  pardon, and you shall be  pardoned;
25186	42	6	38	 give, and gifts shall be bestowed on you. Full measure, pressed, shaken down, and running over, shall they pour into your laps; for with the same measure that you use they shall measure to you in return."
25187	42	6	39	  He also spoke to them in figurative language. "Can a blind man lead a blind man?" He asked; "would not both fall into the ditch?
25188	42	6	40	 There is no disciple who is superior to his teacher; but every one whose instruction is complete will be like his teacher.
25189	42	6	41	 "And why look at the splinter in your brother's eye instead of giving careful attention to the beam in your own?
25190	42	6	42	 How can you say to your brother, `Brother, let me take that splinter out of your eye,' when all the while you yourself do not see the beam in your own eye? Vain pretender! take the beam out of your own eye first, and then you will see clearly to take the splinter out of your brother's eye.
25191	42	6	43	  "There is no good tree that yields unsound fruit, nor again any unsound tree that yields good fruit.
25192	42	6	44	 Every tree is known by its own fruit. It is not from thorns that men gather figs, nor from the bramble that they can get a bunch of grapes.
25193	42	6	45	 A good man from the good stored up in his heart brings out what is good; and an evil man from the evil stored up brings out what is evil; for from the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks.
25194	42	6	46	 "And why do you all call me `Master, Master' and yet not do what I tell you?
25195	42	6	47	 Every one who comes to me and listens to my words and puts them in practice, I will show you whom he is like.
25196	42	6	48	 He is like a man building a house, who  digs and goes deep, and lays the foundation on the rock; and when a flood comes, the torrent bursts upon that house, but is unable to shake it, because it is securely built.
25197	42	6	49	 But he who has heard and not practised is like a man who has built a house upon the soft soil without a foundation, against which the torrent bursts, and immediately it collapses, and terrible is the wreck and ruin of that house."
25198	42	7	1	  After He had finished teaching all these things  in the hearing of the people, He went into Capernaum.
25199	42	7	2	 Here the  servant of a certain Captain, a man dear to his master, was ill and at the point of death;
25200	42	7	3	 and the Captain, hearing about Jesus, sent to Him some of the Jewish Elders, begging Him to come and  restore his servant to health.
25201	42	7	4	 And they, when they came to Jesus, earnestly entreated Him, pleading, "He deserves to have this favour granted him,
25202	42	7	5	 for he loves our nation, and at his own expense he built our synagogue for us."
25203	42	7	6	 Then Jesus went with them. But when He was not far from the house, the Captain sent friends to Him with the message: "Sir, do not trouble to come.  I am not worthy of having you come under my roof;
25204	42	7	7	 and therefore I did not deem myself worthy to come to you. Only speak the word, and  let my  young man be cured.
25205	42	7	8	 For I too am a man obedient to authority, and have soldiers under me; and I say to one, `Go,' and he goes; to another, `Come,' and he comes; and to my slave, `Do this or that,' and he does it."
25206	42	7	9	 Jesus listened to the Captain's message and was astonished at him, and He turned and said to the crowd that followed Him, "I tell you that not even in Israel have I found faith like that."
25207	42	7	10	 And the friends who had been sent, on returning to the house, found the servant in perfect health.
25208	42	7	11	  Shortly afterwards He went to a town called Nain, attended by  His disciples and a great crowd of people.
25209	42	7	12	 And just as He reached the gate of the town, they happened to be bringing out for burial a dead man who was his mother's only son; and she was a widow; and a great number of the townspeople were with her.
25210	42	7	13	 The Lord saw her, was moved with pity for her, and said to her, "Do not weep."
25211	42	7	14	 Then He went close and touched the bier, and the bearers halted. "Young man," He said, "I command you, wake!"
25212	42	7	15	 The dead man sat up and began to speak; and He restored him to his mother.
25213	42	7	16	 All were awe-struck, and they gave glory to God--some saying, "A Prophet, a great Prophet, has  risen up among us." Others said, "God has not forgotten His People."
25214	42	7	17	 And the report of what Jesus had done spread through the whole of Judaea and in all the surrounding districts.
25215	42	7	18	  John's disciples brought him an account of all these things;
25216	42	7	19	 so John called two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord. "Are you the Coming One?" he asked, "or is there  another that we are to expect?"
25217	42	7	20	 The men came to Jesus and said, "John the Baptist has sent us to you with this question: `Are you the Coming One, or is there another that we are to expect?'"
25218	42	7	21	  He immediately cured many of diseases, severe pain, and evil spirits, and to many who were blind He gave the gift of sight.
25219	42	7	22	 Then He answered the messengers, "Go and report to John what you have seen and heard. Blind men  receive sight, the lame walk, lepers are purified, deaf persons hear, the dead are  raised to life, the poor have the Good News proclaimed to them.
25220	42	7	23	 And blessed is every one who does not stumble and fall because of my claims."
25221	42	7	24	  When John's messengers were gone, He proceeded to say to the multitude concerning John, "What did you go out into the Desert to gaze at? A reed waving in the wind?
25222	42	7	25	 But what did you go out to see? A man wearing luxurious clothes? People who are gorgeously dressed and live in luxury are found in palaces.
25223	42	7	26	 But what did you go out to see? A Prophet? Aye, I tell you, and far more than a Prophet.
25224	42	7	27	 John is the man about whom it is written, <`See, I am sending My messenger before thy face, and he shall make ready thy way before thee.'>
25225	42	7	28	 "I tell you that among all of women born there is not one greater than John. Yet one who is of lower rank in the Kingdom of God is greater than he.
25226	42	7	29	 And all the people, including the tax-gatherers, when they listened to him upheld the righteousness of God, by being baptized with John's baptism.
25227	42	7	30	 But the Pharisees and expounders of the Law have frustrated  God's purpose as to their own lives, by refusing to be  baptized.
25228	42	7	31	 "To what then shall I compare the men of the present generation, and what do they resemble?
25229	42	7	32	 They are like children sitting in the public square and calling out to one another, `We have played the flute to you, and you have not danced: we have sung dirges, and you have not shown sorrow.'
25230	42	7	33	 For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, `He has a demon!'
25231	42	7	34	 The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, `Look, there is a man who is overfond of eating and drinking--he is a friend of tax-gatherers and notorious sinners!'
25232	42	7	35	 But wisdom  is justified by all  who are truly wise."
25233	42	7	36	  Now one of the Pharisees  repeatedly invited Him to a meal at his house; so He entered the house and reclined at the table.
25234	42	7	37	 And there was a woman in the town who was a notorious sinner. Having learnt that Jesus  was at table in the Pharisee's house she brought a flask of perfume,
25235	42	7	38	 and, standing  behind close to His feet, weeping, began to wet His feet with her tears; and with her hair she wiped the tears away again, while she lovingly kissed His feet and poured the perfume over them.
25236	42	7	39	 Noticing this, the Pharisee, His host, said to himself,  "This man, if he were really a Prophet, would know who and what sort of person this woman is who is touching him--and would know that she is an immoral woman."
25237	42	7	40	 In answer to  his thoughts Jesus said to him, "Simon, I have a word to say to you."  "Rabbi, say on," he replied.
25238	42	7	41	 "There were once two men in debt to one money-lender," said Jesus; "one owed him five hundred shillings and the other fifty.
25239	42	7	42	 But neither of them could pay anything; so he freely forgave them both. Tell me, then, which of them will love him most?"
25240	42	7	43	 "I suppose," replied Simon, "the one to whom he forgave most." "You have judged rightly," Jesus rejoined.
25241	42	7	44	 Then turning towards the woman He said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I came into your house: you gave me no water for my feet; but she has made my feet wet with her tears, and then wiped the tears away with her hair.
25242	42	7	45	 No kiss did you give me; but she from the moment I came in has not left off tenderly kissing my feet.
25243	42	7	46	 No oil did you pour even on my head; but she has poured perfume upon my feet.
25244	42	7	47	 This is the reason why I tell you that her sins, her many sins,  are forgiven--because she has loved much; but he who is forgiven little, loves little."
25245	42	7	48	 And He said to her, "Your sins  are forgiven."
25246	42	7	49	 Then the other guests began to say to themselves, "Who can this man be who even forgives sins?"
25247	42	7	50	 But He said to the woman, "Your faith has  cured you:  go, and be at peace."
25248	42	8	1	 Shortly after this He visited town after town, and village after village, proclaiming His Message and telling  the Good News of the Kingdom of God. The Twelve were with Him,
25249	42	8	2	 and certain women whom He had  delivered from evil spirits and various diseases--Mary of Magdala, out of whom seven demons had come,
25250	42	8	3	 and  Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many other women, all of whom contributed to  the support of Jesus and His Apostles.
25251	42	8	4	  And when a great crowd was assembling, and was receiving additions from one town after another, He spoke a parable to them.
25252	42	8	5	 "The sower," He said,  "goes out to sow his seed; and as he sows, some of the seed falls by the way-side, and is trodden upon, or the birds of the air come and peck it up.
25253	42	8	6	 Another part drops upon the rock, and after growing up it withers away for want of moisture.
25254	42	8	7	 Another part falls among the thorns, and the thorns grow up with it and stifle it.
25255	42	8	8	 But some of the seed falls into good ground, and grows up and yields a return of a hundred for one." While thus speaking, He cried aloud and said, "Listen, every one who has ears to listen with!"
25256	42	8	9	 The disciples  proceeded to ask Him what this parable meant.
25257	42	8	10	 "To you," He replied, "it is granted to know the secrets of the Kingdom of God; but all others are taught by parables, in order that they may see and yet not see, and may hear and yet not understand.
25258	42	8	11	 The meaning of the parable is as follows. The seed is God's Message.
25259	42	8	12	 Those by the way-side are those who have heard, and then the Devil comes and carries away the Message from their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.
25260	42	8	13	 Those on the rock are the people who on hearing the Message receive it joyfully; but they have no root: for a time they believe, but when trial comes they fall away.
25261	42	8	14	 That which fell among the thorns means those who have heard, but as they go on their way, the Message is stifled by the anxieties, wealth and gaieties of time, and they yield nothing in perfection.
25262	42	8	15	 But as for that in the good ground, it means those who, having listened to the Message with open  minds and in a right spirit, hold it fast, and patiently yield a return.
25263	42	8	16	 "When any one lights a lamp, he does not cover it with a vessel or hide it under  a couch; he puts it on  a lampstand, that people who enter the room may see the light.
25264	42	8	17	 There is nothing hidden, which shall not be openly seen; nor anything secret, which shall not be known and come into the light of day.
25265	42	8	18	 Be careful, therefore, how you hear; for whoever has anything, to him more shall be given, and whoever has nothing, even that which he thinks he has shall be taken away from him."
25266	42	8	19	  Then came to Him His mother and His brothers, but could not get near Him for the crowd.
25267	42	8	20	 But He was told, "Your mother and brothers are standing on the edge of the crowd, and want to see you."
25268	42	8	21	 "My mother and my brothers," He replied, "are  these who hear God's Message and obey it."
25269	42	8	22	  One day He went on board a boat--both He and his disciples; and He said to them, "Let us cross over to the other side of the Lake." So they set sail.
25270	42	8	24	 So they came and woke Him, crying,  "Rabbi, Rabbi, we are drowning." Then He roused Himself and rebuked the wind and the surging of the water, and they ceased and there was a calm.
25271	42	8	25	 "Where is your faith?" He asked them. But they were filled with terror and amazement, and said to one another, "Who then is this? for He gives orders both to wind and waves, and they obey Him."
25272	42	8	26	  Then they put in to shore in the country of the  Gerasenes, which lies opposite to Galilee.
25273	42	8	27	 Here, on landing, He was met by one of the townsmen who was possessed by demons--for a long time he had not put on any garment, nor did he live in a house, but in the tombs.
25274	42	8	28	 When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before Him, and said in a loud voice, "What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of God Most High? Do not torture me, I beseech you."
25275	42	8	29	 For already He  had been commanding the foul spirit to come out of the man. For  many a time it had seized and held him, and they had repeatedly put him in chains and fetters and kept guard over him, but he used to break the chains to pieces, and, impelled by the demon, to escape into the Desert.
25276	42	8	30	 "What is your name?" Jesus asked him. "Legion," he replied--because a great number of demons had entered into him;
25277	42	8	31	 and they besought Him not to command them to be gone into the  Bottomless Pit.
25278	42	8	32	 Now there was  a great herd of swine there feeding on the hill-side; and the demons begged Him to give them leave to go into them, and He gave them leave.
25279	42	8	33	 The demons  came out of the man and left him, and entered into the swine; and the herd rushed violently over the cliff into the Lake and were drowned.
25280	42	8	34	 The swineherds, seeing what had happened, fled and reported it both in town and country;
25281	42	8	35	 whereupon the people came out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and they found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they were terrified.
25282	42	8	36	  And those who had seen it told them how the demoniac was cured.
25283	42	8	37	 Then the whole population of the Gerasenes and of the adjacent districts begged Him to depart from them; for  their terror was great. So He went on board and returned.
25284	42	8	38	 But the man from whom the demons had gone out earnestly asked permission to go with Him; but He sent him away.
25285	42	8	39	 "Return home," He said, "and tell there all that God has done for you." So he went and published through the whole town all that Jesus had done for him.
25286	42	8	40	  Now when Jesus  was returning, the people gave Him a warm welcome; for they had all been looking out for Him.
25287	42	8	41	 Just then there came a man named Jair, a Warden of the Synagogue, who threw himself at the feet of Jesus, and entreated Him to come to his house;
25288	42	8	42	 for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. And as He went, the dense throng crowded on Him.
25289	42	8	43	 And a woman who for twelve years had been afflicted with haemorrhage--and had spent on doctors all she had, but  none of them had been able to cure her--
25290	42	8	44	 came close behind Him and touched the tassel of His robe; and instantly her flow of blood stopped.
25291	42	8	45	 "Who is it touched me?" Jesus asked. And when all denied having done so, Peter and the rest said, "Rabbi, the crowds are hemming you in and pressing on you."
25292	42	8	46	 "Some one has touched me," Jesus replied, "for  I feel that power has gone out from me."
25293	42	8	47	 Then the woman, perceiving that she had not escaped notice, came trembling, and throwing herself down at His feet she stated before all the people the reason why she had touched Him and how she was instantly cured.
25294	42	8	48	 "Daughter," said He, "your faith has cured you; go, and be at peace."
25295	42	8	49	 While He was still speaking, some one came to the Warden of the Synagogue from his house and said, "Your daughter is dead; trouble the  Rabbi no further."
25296	42	8	50	 Jesus heard the words and said to him, "Have no fear. Only believe, and she shall be restored to life."
25297	42	8	51	 So He came to the house, but allowed no one to go in with Him but Peter and John and James and the girl's father and mother.
25298	42	8	52	 The people were all weeping aloud and beating their breasts for her; but He said, "Leave off wailing; for she is not dead, but asleep."
25299	42	8	53	 And they jeered at Him, knowing that she was dead.
25300	42	8	54	 He, however, took her by the hand and called aloud, "Child, awake!"
25301	42	8	55	 And her spirit returned, and instantly she stood up; and He directed them to give her some food.
25302	42	8	56	 Her parents were  astounded; but He forbad them to mention the matter to any one.
25303	42	9	1	  Then calling the Twelve together He conferred on them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases;
25304	42	9	2	 and sent them out to proclaim the Kingdom of God and to cure  the sick.
25305	42	9	3	 And He commanded them, "Take nothing for your journey; neither stick nor bag nor bread nor money; and do not have an extra under garment.
25306	42	9	4	 Whatever house you enter, make that your home, and from it start afresh.
25307	42	9	5	 Wherever they refuse to receive you, as you leave that town shake off the very dust from your feet as a protest against them."
25308	42	9	6	 So they departed and visited village after village, spreading the Good News and performing cures everywhere.
25309	42	9	7	  Now Herod the Tetrarch heard of all that was going on; and he was bewildered because of its being said by some that John had come back to life,
25310	42	9	8	 by others that Elijah had appeared, and by others that some one of the ancient Prophets had come back to life.
25311	42	9	9	 And Herod said, "John I have beheaded; but who is this, of whom I hear such reports?" And he sought for an opportunity of seeing Jesus.
25312	42	9	10	  The Apostles, on their return, related to Jesus all they had done. Then He took them and withdrew to a quiet retreat,  to a town called Bethsaida.
25313	42	9	11	 But the immense crowd, aware of this, followed Him; and receiving them kindly He proceeded to speak to them of the Kingdom of God, and those who needed to be restored to health, He cured.
25314	42	9	12	 Now when the day began to decline, the Twelve came to Him and said, "Send the people away, that they may go to the villages and farms round about and find lodging and a supply of food; because here we are in an uninhabited district."
25315	42	9	13	 "You yourselves," He said, "must give them food." "We have nothing," they replied, "but five loaves and a couple of fish, unless indeed we were to go and buy provisions for all this host of people."
25316	42	9	14	 (For there were about 5,000 adult men.) But He said to His disciples, "Make them sit down in parties of about fifty each."
25317	42	9	15	 They did so, making them all, without exception, sit down.
25318	42	9	16	 Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to Heaven He blessed them and broke them into portions which He gave to the disciples  to distribute to the people.
25319	42	9	17	 So they ate and were fully satisfied, all of them; and what they had remaining over was gathered up, twelve baskets of fragments.
25320	42	9	18	  One day when He was praying by Himself the disciples were present; and He asked them, "Who do the people say that I am?"
25321	42	9	19	 "John the Baptist," they replied; "but others say Elijah; and others that some one of the ancient Prophets has come back to life."
25322	42	9	20	 "But you," He asked, "who do you say that I am?" "God's  Anointed One," replied Peter.
25323	42	9	21	 And Jesus strictly forbad them to tell this to any one;
25324	42	9	22	 and He said, "The Son of Man must suffer much cruelty, be rejected by the Elders and High Priests and Scribes, and be put to death, and on the third day  be raised to life again."
25325	42	9	23	 And He said to all, "If any one is desirous of following me, let him  ignore self and take up his cross day by day, and so be my follower.
25326	42	9	24	 For whoever desires to save his life shall lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake shall save it.
25327	42	9	25	 Why, what benefit is it to a man to have gained the whole world, but to have lost or  forfeited his own self.
25328	42	9	26	 For whoever shall have been ashamed of me and my teachings, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when He comes in His own and the Father's glory and in that of the holy angels.
25329	42	9	27	 I tell you truly that there are some of those who stand here who will certainly not taste death  till they have seen the Kingdom of God."
25330	42	9	28	  It was about eight days after this that Jesus, taking with Him Peter, John, and James, went  up the mountain to pray.
25331	42	9	29	 And while He was praying the appearance of His face underwent a change, and His clothing became white and  radiant.
25332	42	9	30	 And suddenly there were two men conversing with Him, who were Moses and Elijah.
25333	42	9	31	 They  came in glory, and kept speaking about His death, which He was so soon to undergo in Jerusalem.
25334	42	9	32	 Now Peter and the others were weighed down with sleep; but, keeping themselves awake all through, they saw His glory, and the two men standing with Him.
25335	42	9	33	 And when they were preparing to depart from Him, Peter said to Jesus,  "Rabbi, we are thankful to you that we are here. Let us put up three tents--one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." He did not know what he was saying.
25336	42	9	34	 But while he was thus speaking, there came a cloud which  spread over them; and they were awe-struck when  they had entered into the cloud.
25337	42	9	35	 Then there came a voice from within the cloud: "This is My Son, My Chosen One: listen to Him."
25338	42	9	36	 After this voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. They kept it to themselves, and said not a word to any one at that time about what they had seen.
25339	42	9	37	  On the following day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great crowd came to meet Him;
25340	42	9	38	 and a man from the crowd called out,  "Rabbi,  I beg you to pity my son, for he is my only child.
25341	42	9	39	 At times a spirit seizes him and he suddenly cries out. It convulses him, and makes him foam at the mouth, and  does not leave him till it has well-nigh covered him with bruises.
25342	42	9	40	 I entreated your disciples to expel the spirit, but they could not."
25343	42	9	41	 "O unbelieving and perverse generation!" replied Jesus; "how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here to me."
25344	42	9	42	 Now while the youth was coming, the spirit  dashed him to the ground and cruelly convulsed him. But Jesus  rebuked the foul spirit, and cured the youth and gave him back to his father.
25345	42	9	43	  And all were awe-struck at the  mighty power of God. And while every one was expressing wonder at all that He was doing, He said to his disciples,
25346	42	9	44	 "As for you, store these my sayings in your  memory; for, before long, the Son of Man will be betrayed into the hands of men."
25347	42	9	45	 But they did not understand His meaning: it was  veiled from them that they might not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask Him about it.
25348	42	9	46	  Now there arose a dispute among them, which of them was to be the greatest.
25349	42	9	47	 And Jesus,  knowing the reasoning that was in their hearts, took a young child and made him stand by His side
25350	42	9	48	 and said to them,  "Whoever  for my sake receives this little child, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives Him who sent me. For the lowliest among you all--he is the  greatest."
25351	42	9	49	 "Rabbi," replied John, "we have seen a man making use of your name to expel demons; and we forbad him, because he does not come with us."
25352	42	9	50	 "Do not forbid him," said Jesus, "for he who is not against you is on your side."
25353	42	9	51	 Now when the time drew near for Him to be received up again into Heaven, He proceeded with fixed purpose towards Jerusalem, and sent messengers before Him.
25354	42	9	52	 They went and entered a village of the Samaritans to make ready for Him.
25355	42	9	53	 But the people there would not receive Him, because He was evidently going to Jerusalem.
25356	42	9	54	 When the disciples James and John saw this, they said, "Master, do you wish us to order fire to come down from Heaven and  consume them?"
25357	42	9	55	 But He turned and rebuked them.
25358	42	9	56	 And they went to another village.
25359	42	9	57	  And, as they proceeded on their way, a man came to Him and said, "I will follow you wherever you go."
25360	42	9	58	 "The foxes have holes," said Jesus, "and the birds of the air have  nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."
25361	42	9	59	 "Follow me," He said to another. "Master," the man replied, "allow me first to go and bury my  father."
25362	42	9	60	 "Leave the dead," Jesus rejoined, "to bury their own dead; but you must go and announce far and wide  the coming of the Kingdom of God."
25363	42	9	61	 "Master," said yet another, "I will follow you; but allow me first to go and say good-bye to my friends at home."
25364	42	9	62	 Jesus answered him, "No one who has put his hand to the plough, and then looks behind him, is  fit for the Kingdom of God.
25365	42	10	1	  After this the Lord appointed  seventy  others, and sent them before Him, by twos, to go to every town or place which He Himself intended to visit.
25366	42	10	2	 And He addressed them thus:  "The harvest is abundant, but the reapers are few: therefore entreat the Owner of the harvest to send out more reapers into His  fields. And now go.
25367	42	10	3	 Remember that I am sending you out as lambs into the midst of wolves.
25368	42	10	4	 Carry no purse, bag, nor change of shoes; and  salute no one on your way."
25369	42	10	5	 "Whatever house you enter, first say, `Peace be to this house!'
25370	42	10	6	 And if there is a  lover of peace there, your peace shall rest  upon it; otherwise come back upon you.
25371	42	10	7	 And  in that same house stay, eating and drinking at their table; for the labourer deserves his wages. Do not move from one house to another.
25372	42	10	8	 "And whatever town you come to and they receive you, eat what they put before you.
25373	42	10	9	 Cure the sick in that town, and tell them, "`The Kingdom of God is now at your door.'
25374	42	10	10	 "But whatever town you come to and they will not receive you, go out into the broader streets and say,
25375	42	10	11	 "`The very dust of your town that hangs about us we wipe off as a protest. Only be sure of this, that the Kingdom of God is close at hand.'
25376	42	10	12	 "I tell you that it will be more endurable for Sodom on the great day than for that town.
25377	42	10	13	  "Alas for thee, Chorazin! Alas for thee, Bethsaida! For had the miracles been performed in Tyre and Sidon which have been performed in you, long ere now they would have repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
25378	42	10	14	 However, for Tyre and Sidon it will be more endurable at the Judgement than for you.
25379	42	10	15	 And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be lifted high as Heaven? Thou shalt be driven down as low as Hades.
25380	42	10	16	 "He who listens to you listens to me; and he who  disregards you disregards me, and he who disregards me disregards Him who sent me."
25381	42	10	17	  When the Seventy returned, they exclaimed joyfully, "Master, even the demons submit to us  when we utter your name."
25382	42	10	18	 "I saw Satan  fall like a lightning-flash out of Heaven," He replied.
25383	42	10	19	 "I have given you  power to tread serpents and scorpions underfoot, and to trample on all the power of the Enemy; and in no case shall anything do you harm.
25384	42	10	20	 Nevertheless rejoice not at this, that the spirits submit to you; but rejoice that your names are registered in Heaven."
25385	42	10	21	 On that  same occasion Jesus was filled by the Holy Spirit with  rapturous joy. "I give Thee fervent thanks," He exclaimed, "O Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, that Thou hast hidden these things from sages and men of understanding, and hast revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for such has been Thy gracious will.
25386	42	10	22	 All things are delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is but the Father, nor who the Father is but the Son, and he to whom the Son may choose to reveal  Him."
25387	42	10	23	 And He turned towards His disciples and said to them apart, "Blessed are the eyes which see what you see!
25388	42	10	24	 For I tell you that many Prophets and kings have desired to see the things you see, and have not seen them, and to hear the things you hear, and have not heard them."
25389	42	10	25	 Then an expounder of the Law stood up to test Him with a question.  "Rabbi," he asked, "what shall I do to inherit the Life of the Ages?"
25390	42	10	26	 "Go to the Law," said Jesus; "what is written there? how does it read?"
25391	42	10	27	 <"`Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,'"> he replied,  <"`with thy whole heart, thy whole soul, thy whole strength, and thy whole mind; and thy fellow man as much as thyself.'">
25392	42	10	28	 "A right answer," said Jesus; "do that, and you shall live."
25393	42	10	29	 But he, desiring to justify himself, said, "But what is meant by my `fellow man'?"
25394	42	10	30	 Jesus replied, "A man was once on his way down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell among robbers, who after both stripping and beating him went away, leaving him half dead.
25395	42	10	31	 Now a priest happened to be going down that way, and on seeing him passed by on the other side.
25396	42	10	32	 In like manner a Levite also came to the place, and seeing him passed by on the other side.
25397	42	10	33	 But a certain Samaritan, being on a journey, came where he lay, and seeing him was moved with pity.
25398	42	10	34	 He went to him, and dressed his wounds with oil and wine and bound them up. Then placing him on his own  mule he brought him to an  inn, where he bestowed every care on him.
25399	42	10	35	 The next day he took out two shillings and gave them to the innkeeper. "`Take care of him,' he said, `and whatever further expense you are put to, I will repay it you at my next visit.'
25400	42	10	36	 "Which of those three seems to you to have acted  like a fellow man to him who fell among the robbers?"
25401	42	10	37	  "The one who showed him pity," he replied. "Go," said Jesus, "and act in the same way."
25402	42	10	38	 As they pursued their journey He came to a certain village, where a woman named Martha welcomed Him to her house.
25403	42	10	39	 She had a sister called Mary, who seated herself  at the Lord's feet and listened to His teaching.
25404	42	10	40	 Martha meanwhile was  busy and distracted in waiting at table, and she  came and said, "Master, do you not care that my sister  is leaving me to do all the waiting? Tell her to assist me."
25405	42	10	41	 "Martha, Martha," replied Jesus, "you are anxious and worried about a multitude of things;
25406	42	10	42	 and yet  only one thing is really necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion and she shall not be deprived of it."
25407	42	11	1	  At one place where He was praying, when He  rose from His knees one of His disciples said to Him, "Master, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples."
25408	42	11	2	 So He said to them, "When you pray, say, `Father may Thy name be kept holy; let Thy Kingdom come;
25409	42	11	3	  give us day after day our bread for the day;
25410	42	11	4	 and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive every one who  fails in his duty to us; and bring us not into temptation.'"
25411	42	11	5	 And He said to them, "Which of you shall have a friend and shall go to him in the middle of the night and say, "`Friend, lend me three loaves of bread;
25412	42	11	6	 for a friend of mine has just come to my house from a distance, and I have nothing for him to eat'?
25413	42	11	7	 "And  he from indoors shall answer, "`Do not pester me. The door is now barred, and I am here in bed with my children. I cannot get up and give you bread.'
25414	42	11	8	 "I tell you that even if he will not rise and give him the loaves because he is his friend, at any rate because of his  persistency he will rouse himself and give him as many as he requires.
25415	42	11	9	 "So I say to you, `Ask, and what you ask for shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and the door shall be opened to you.'
25416	42	11	10	 For every one who asks, receives; and he who seeks, finds; and to him who knocks, the door shall be opened.
25417	42	11	11	 And what father is there among you, who, if his son asks for  a slice of bread, will offer him a stone? or if he asks for a fish, will instead of a fish offer him a snake?
25418	42	11	12	 or if he asks for an egg, will offer him a scorpion?
25419	42	11	13	 If you then,  with all your human frailty, know how to give your children gifts that are good for them, how much more certainly will your Father  who is in Heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!"
25420	42	11	14	  On once occasion He was expelling a dumb demon; and when the demon was gone out the dumb man could speak, and the  people were astonished.
25421	42	11	15	 But some among them said, "It is  by the power of Baal-zebul, the Prince of the demons, that he expels the demons."
25422	42	11	16	 Others, to put Him to the test, asked Him for a  sign in the sky.
25423	42	11	17	  And, knowing their thoughts, He said to them, "Every kingdom  in which civil war rages goes to ruin:  family attacks family and is overthrown.
25424	42	11	18	 And if Satan  really has engaged in fierce conflict with himself, how shall his kingdom stand?--because you say that I expel demons by the power of Baal-zebul.
25425	42	11	19	 And if it is by the power of Baal-zebul that I expel the demons, by whom do  your disciples expel them? They therefore shall be your judges.
25426	42	11	20	 But if it is by the  power of God that I drive out the demons, it is evident that  the Kingdom of God  has come upon you.
25427	42	11	21	 "Whenever a strong man, fully armed and equipped, is guarding his own castle, he enjoys peaceful possession of his property;
25428	42	11	22	 but as soon as another stronger than he attacks him and overcomes him, he takes away that complete armour of his in which he trusted, and distributes the plunder he has collected.
25429	42	11	23	 Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever is not gathering with me is scattering abroad.
25430	42	11	24	 "When a foul spirit has left a man, it roams about in the Desert, seeking a resting-place; but, unable to find any, it says, `I will return to the house I have left;"
25431	42	11	25	 and when it comes, it finds the house swept clean and  in good order.
25432	42	11	26	 Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more malignant than itself, and they enter and dwell there; and in the end that man's condition becomes worse than it was at first.
25433	42	11	27	 As He thus spoke a woman in the crowd called out in a loud voice, "Blessed is the mother who carried you, and the breasts that you have sucked."
25434	42	11	28	  "Nay rather," He replied, "they are blessed who hear God's Message and  carefully keep it."
25435	42	11	29	  Now when the crowds came thronging upon Him, He proceeded to say, "The present generation is a wicked generation: it requires some sign, but no sign shall be given to it except that of Jonah.
25436	42	11	30	 For just as Jonah became a sign to the men of Nineveh, so the Son of Man will be a token to the present generation.
25437	42	11	31	 The Queen of the South will awake at the Judgement together with the men of the present generation, and will condemn them; because she came from the extremity of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; but mark!  One greater than Solomon is here.
25438	42	11	32	 There will stand up men of Nineveh at the Judgement together with the present generation, and will condemn it; because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and mark!  One greater than Jonah is here.
25439	42	11	33	 "When any one lights a lamp, he never puts it  in the cellar or under the bushel, but on the lampstand, that people who come in may see the light.
25440	42	11	34	 The lamp of the body is the eye. When your eyesight is good, your whole body also is lighted up; but when it is defective, your body is darkened.
25441	42	11	35	 Consider therefore whether the light that is in you is anything but mere darkness.
25442	42	11	36	 If, however, your whole body is penetrated with light, and has no part dark, it will be so lighted, all of it, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light."
25443	42	11	37	 When He had thus spoken, a Pharisee invited Him to breakfast at his house; so He entered and took His place at table.
25444	42	11	38	 Now the Pharisee saw to his surprise that He did not wash His hands before breakfasting.
25445	42	11	39	 The Master however said to him, "Here we see how you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup or plate, while your secret hearts are full of greed and  selfishness.
25446	42	11	40	 Foolish men! Did not He who made the outside make the inside also?
25447	42	11	41	 But as to what is within,  give alms, and  instantly all is clean  in you.
25448	42	11	42	 "But  alas for you Pharisees! for you pay tithes on your mint and rue and every kind of garden vegetable, and are indifferent to justice and the love of God. These are the things you ought to have  attended to, while not neglecting the others.
25449	42	11	43	 Alas for you Pharisees! for you love the best seats in the synagogues, and you like to be bowed to in places of public resort.
25450	42	11	44	 Alas for you! for you are like the tombs which lie hidden, and the people who walk over them are not aware of their existence."
25451	42	11	45	 Hereupon one of the expounders of the Law exclaimed,  "Rabbi, in saying such things you reproach us also."
25452	42	11	46	 "Alas too for you expounders of the Law!" replied Jesus, "for you load men with cumbrous burdens which you yourselves will not touch with one of your fingers.
25453	42	11	47	 Alas for you! for you repair the tombs of the Prophets, whom your forefathers killed.
25454	42	11	48	  It follows that you  bear testimony to the actions of your forefathers and that you fully approve thereof. They slew, you build.
25455	42	11	49	 "For this reason also the Wisdom of God has said, `I will send Prophets and Apostles to them, of whom they will kill some and persecute others,'
25456	42	11	50	 so that the blood of all the Prophets,  that is being shed from the creation of the world onwards, may be  required from the present generation.
25457	42	11	51	 Yes, I tell you that,  from the blood of Abel down to the blood of Zechariah who perished between the altar and the House, it shall all be required from the present generation.
25458	42	11	52	 "Alas for you expounders of the Law! for you have taken away the key of knowledge: you yourselves have not entered, and those who wanted to enter you have hindered."
25459	42	11	53	 After He had left the house, the Scribes and Pharisees commenced a vehement attempt to entangle Him and make Him give off-hand answers on numerous points,
25460	42	11	54	 lying in wait to catch some unguarded expression from His lips.
25461	42	12	1	 Meanwhile the people had come streaming towards Him by tens of thousands, so that they were trampling one another under foot. And now He proceeded to say  to His disciples first, "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, that is to say, beware of hypocrisy.
25462	42	12	2	 There is nothing that is covered up which will not be uncovered, nor hidden which will not become known.
25463	42	12	3	 Whatever therefore you have said in the dark, will be heard in the light; and what you have whispered within closed doors will be proclaimed from the house-tops.
25464	42	12	4	 "But to you who are my friends I say, "`Be not afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do nothing further.
25465	42	12	5	 I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who after killing has power to throw into Gehenna: yes, I say to you, fear him.
25466	42	12	6	 Are not five sparrows sold for  a penny? and yet not one of them is a thing forgotten in God's sight.
25467	42	12	7	 But the very hairs on your heads are all counted. Away with fear: you are more precious than a multitude of sparrows.'
25468	42	12	8	 "And I tell you that  every man who shall have  acknowledged me before men, the Son of Man will also acknowledge before the angels of God.
25469	42	12	9	 But he who disowns me before men will be disowned before the angels of God.
25470	42	12	10	 "Moreover every one who  shall speak against the Son of Man,  may obtain forgiveness; but he who  blasphemes the Holy Spirit will never obtain forgiveness.
25471	42	12	11	 And when they are bringing you before synagogues and magistrates and governors, do not anxiously ponder the manner or matter of your defence, nor what you are to say;
25472	42	12	12	 for the Holy Spirit shall teach you at that very moment what you must say."
25473	42	12	13	 Just then a man in the crowd appealed to Him.  "Rabbi," he said, "tell my brother to give me a share of the inheritance."
25474	42	12	14	 "Man," He replied, "who has constituted me a judge or arbitrator over you?"
25475	42	12	15	 And to the people He said, "Take care, be on your guard against all covetousness, for no one's life consists in the superabundance of his possessions."
25476	42	12	16	 And He spoke a parable to them. "A certain rich man's lands," He said, "yielded abundant crops,
25477	42	12	17	 and he debated within himself, saying, "`What am I to do? for I have no place in which to store my crops.'
25478	42	12	18	 "And he said to himself, "`This is what I will do: I will pull down my barns and build larger ones, and in them I will store up all my harvest and my wealth;
25479	42	12	19	 and I will say to my  life, "`Life, you have ample possessions laid up for many years to come: take your ease, eat, drink, enjoy yourself.'
25480	42	12	20	 "But God said to him, "`Foolish man, this night your life is demanded from you; and these preparations--for whom shall they be?'
25481	42	12	21	 "So is it with him who amasses treasure for himself, but has no riches  in God."
25482	42	12	22	 Then turning to His disciples He said,  "For this reason I say to you, `Dismiss all anxious care for your  lives, inquiring what you are to eat, and for your  bodies, what you are to put on.'
25483	42	12	23	 For life is a greater gift than  food, and the body is a greater gift than clothing.
25484	42	12	24	  Observe the ravens. They neither sow nor reap, and have neither store-chamber nor barn. And yet God feeds them. How far more precious are you than the birds!
25485	42	12	25	 And which of you is able by anxious thought to add  a  moment to his life?
25486	42	12	26	 If then you are unable to do even a very little thing, why be over-anxious about other matters?
25487	42	12	27	 Observe the lilies, how they grow. They neither labour nor spin. And yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendour was  as beautifully dressed as one of these.
25488	42	12	28	 But if God so clothes the vegetation in the fields, that  blooms to-day and to-morrow will be thrown into the oven, how much more certainly will He clothe you, you men of feeble faith!
25489	42	12	29	 "Therefore, do not be asking what you are to eat nor what you are to drink; and do not waver between hope and fear.
25490	42	12	30	 For though the nations of the world pursue these things, as for you, your Father knows that you need them.
25491	42	12	31	 But make His Kingdom the object of your pursuit, and these things shall be given you in addition.
25492	42	12	32	 "Dismiss your fears, little flock: your Father finds a pleasure in giving you the Kingdom.
25493	42	12	33	 Sell your possessions and give alms. Provide yourselves with purses that will never wear out, a treasure inexhaustible in Heaven, where no thief can come nor moth consume.
25494	42	12	34	 For where your wealth is stored, there also will your heart be.
25495	42	12	35	 "Have your girdles on, and let your lamps be alight;
25496	42	12	36	 and be yourselves like men waiting for their master--on the look-out till he shall  return from the wedding feast--that, when he comes and knocks, they may open the door instantly.
25497	42	12	37	 Blessed are those servants, whom their Master when He comes shall find on the watch. I tell you in solemn truth, that He will tie an apron round Him, and will bid them recline at table while He comes and waits on them.
25498	42	12	38	 And whether it be in the second watch or in the third that He comes and finds them so, blessed are they.
25499	42	12	39	 Of this be sure, that if the master of the house had known what time the robber was coming, he would have kept awake and not have allowed his house to be broken into.
25500	42	12	40	 Be you also ready, for at an hour when you are not expecting Him the Son of Man will come."
25501	42	12	41	 "Master," said Peter, "are you addressing this parable to us, or to all alike?"
25502	42	12	42	 "Who, then," replied the Lord, "is the faithful and intelligent steward whom his Master will put in charge of His household to serve out their rations at the proper times?
25503	42	12	43	 Blessed is that servant whom his Master when He comes shall find so doing.
25504	42	12	44	 I tell you truly that He will put him in authority over all His possessions.
25505	42	12	45	 But if that servant  should say in his heart, `My Master is a long time in coming,' and should begin to beat the  menservants and the maids, and to eat and drink, drinking even to excess;
25506	42	12	46	 that servant's Master will come on a day when he is not expecting Him and at an hour that he knows not of, and will  punish him severely, and make him share the lot of the unfaithful.
25507	42	12	47	 And that servant who has been told his Master's will and yet made no preparation and did not obey His will, will receive many lashes.
25508	42	12	48	 But he who had not been told it and yet did what deserved the scourge, will receive but few lashes. To whomsoever much has been given, from him much will be required; and to whom much has been  entrusted, of him a larger amount will be demanded.
25509	42	12	49	  "I came to throw fire upon the earth, and what is my desire? Oh that it were even now kindled!
25510	42	12	50	  But I have a baptism to undergo; and how am I pent up till it is accomplished!
25511	42	12	51	  Do you suppose that I came to give peace on earth? No, I tell you that I came to bring dissension.
25512	42	12	52	 For from this time there will be in one house five persons split into parties. Three will form a party against two and two will form a party against three;
25513	42	12	53	 father against son and son against father; mother attacking daughter and daughter her mother, mother-in-law her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law her mother-in-law."
25514	42	12	54	 Then He said to the  people also, "When you see a cloud  rising in the west, you immediately say, `There is to be  a shower;' and it comes to pass.
25515	42	12	55	 And when you see a south wind blowing, you say, `It will be burning hot;' and it comes to pass.
25516	42	12	56	 Vain pretenders! You know how to read the aspect of earth and sky. How is it you cannot read this present time?
25517	42	12	57	 "Why, too, do you not of yourselves arrive at just conclusions?
25518	42	12	58	  For when, with  your opponent,  you are  going before the magistrate, on the way take pains to get out of his power; for fear that, if he  should drag you before the judge, the judge  may hand you over to the officer of the court, and the officer lodge you in prison.
25519	42	12	59	 Never, I tell you, will you get free till you have paid the last farthing."
25520	42	13	1	 Just at that time people came to tell Him about the Galilaeans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
25521	42	13	2	 "Do you suppose," He asked in reply, "that  those Galilaeans were worse sinners than the mass of the Galilaeans, because this happened to them?
25522	42	13	3	 I tell you, certainly not. On the contrary, if you  are not penitent you will all perish  as they did.
25523	42	13	4	 Or those eighteen on whom the tower at Siloam fell, do you suppose they had  failed in their duty more than all the rest of the people who live in Jerusalem?
25524	42	13	5	 I tell you, certainly not. On the contrary, if you  do not repent you will all perish  just as they did."
25525	42	13	6	 And He gave them the following parable. "A man," He said, "who had a fig-tree growing in his garden came to look for fruit on it and could find none.
25526	42	13	7	 So he said to the gardener, "`See, this is the third year I have come to look for fruit on this fig-tree and cannot find any. Cut it down. Why should so much ground be actually wasted?'
25527	42	13	8	 "But the gardener pleaded, "`Leave it, Sir, this year also, till I have dug round it and manured it.
25528	42	13	9	 If after that it bears fruit,  well and good; if it does not, then you shall cut it down.'"
25529	42	13	10	 Once He was teaching on the Sabbath in one of the synagogues
25530	42	13	11	 where a woman was present who for eighteen years  had been a confirmed invalid: she was bent double, and was unable to lift herself to her full height.
25531	42	13	12	 But Jesus saw her, and calling to her, He said to her, "Woman,  you are free from your weakness."
25532	42	13	13	 And He put His hands on her, and she immediately stood upright and began to give glory to God.
25533	42	13	14	 Then the Warden of the Synagogue, indignant that Jesus had cured her on a Sabbath, said to the crowd, "There are six days in the week on which people ought to work. On those days therefore come and get yourselves cured, and not on the Sabbath day."
25534	42	13	15	 But the Lord's reply to him was, "Hypocrites, does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his bullock or his ass from the stall and lead him to water?
25535	42	13	16	 And this woman, daughter of Abraham as she is, whom Satan had bound for no less than eighteen years, was she not to be loosed from this chain because it is the Sabbath day?"
25536	42	13	17	 When He had said this, all His opponents were ashamed, while the whole multitude was delighted at the many glorious things continually done by Him.
25537	42	13	18	  This prompted Him to say, "What is the Kingdom of God like? and to what shall I compare it?
25538	42	13	19	 It is like a mustard seed which a man drops into the soil in his garden, and it grows and becomes a tree in whose branches the birds roost."
25539	42	13	20	 And again He said, "To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God?
25540	42	13	21	 It is like yeast which a woman takes and buries in a bushel of flour, to work there till the whole is leavened."
25541	42	13	22	 He was passing through town after town and village after village, steadily proceeding towards Jerusalem,
25542	42	13	23	 when some one asked Him, "Sir, are there but few who are to be saved?"
25543	42	13	24	  "Strain every nerve to force your way in through the narrow gate," He answered; "for multitudes, I tell you, will  endeavour to find a way in and will not succeed.
25544	42	13	25	  As soon as the Master of the house shall have risen and shut the door, and you have begun to stand outside and knock at the door and say, "`Sir, open the door for us' --"`I do not know you,' He answers;  `you are no friends of mine.'
25545	42	13	26	 "Then you will plead, "`We have eaten and drunk in your company and you have taught in our streets.'
25546	42	13	27	 "But He will reply, "`I tell you that you are no friends of mine. Begone from me, all of you, wrongdoers that you are.'
25547	42	13	28	 "There will be  the weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and yourselves being driven far away.
25548	42	13	29	 They will come from east and west, from north and south, and will sit down at the banquet in the Kingdom of God.
25549	42	13	30	 And  I tell you that some now last  will then be first, and some now first will then be last."
25550	42	13	31	 Just at that time there came some Pharisees who warned Him, saying, "Leave this place and continue your journey; Herod means to kill you."
25551	42	13	32	 "Go," He replied, "and take this message to that fox: "`See, to-day and to-morrow I am driving out demons and effecting cures, and on the third day I finish my course.'
25552	42	13	33	  "Yet I must continue my journey to-day and to-morrow and the day following; for it is not conceivable that a Prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem.
25553	42	13	34	  O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou who murderest the Prophets and stonest those who have been sent to thee, how often have I desired to gather thy children just as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not come!
25554	42	13	35	 See, your house  is left to you. But I tell you that you will never see me again  until you say, <`Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!'">
25555	42	14	1	 One day--it was a Sabbath--He was  taking a meal at the house of one of the Rulers of the Pharisee party, while they were closely watching Him.
25556	42	14	2	 In front of Him was a man suffering from dropsy.
25557	42	14	3	 This led Jesus to ask the lawyers and Pharisees, "Is it allowable to cure people on the Sabbath?"
25558	42	14	4	 They gave Him no answer; so He took hold of the man, cured him, and sent him away.
25559	42	14	5	 Then He turned to them and said, "Which of you shall have a  child or an ox fall into a well on the Sabbath day, and will not immediately lift him out?"
25560	42	14	6	 To this they could make no reply.
25561	42	14	7	 Then, when He noticed that the invited guests chose the best  seats, He used this as an illustration and said to them,
25562	42	14	8	 "When any one invites you to a wedding banquet, do not take the best seat, lest perhaps some more honoured guest than you may have been asked,
25563	42	14	9	 and the man who invited you both will come and will say to you, `Make room for this guest,' and then you, ashamed, will move to the lowest place.
25564	42	14	10	 On the contrary, when you are invited go and take the lowest place, that when your host comes round he may say to you, `My friend, come up higher.' This will be  doing you honour in the presence of all the other guests.
25565	42	14	11	 For whoever uplifts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be uplifted.
25566	42	14	12	 Also to His host, who had invited Him, He said, "When you give a breakfast or a dinner, do not invite your friends or brothers or relatives or rich neighbours, lest perhaps they should invite you in return and a requital be made you.
25567	42	14	13	  But when you entertain, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind;
25568	42	14	14	 and you will be blessed, because they have no means of requiting you, but there will be requital for you at the  Resurrection of the righteous."
25569	42	14	15	 After listening to this teaching, one of His fellow guests said to Him, "Blessed is he who shall feast in God's Kingdom."
25570	42	14	16	 "A man once gave  a great dinner," replied Jesus, "to which he invited a large number of guests.
25571	42	14	17	 At dinner-time he sent his  servant to announce to those who had been invited, "`Come, for things are now ready.'
25572	42	14	18	 "But they all without exception began to excuse themselves. The first told him, "`I have purchased a piece of land, and must of necessity go and look at it. Pray hold me excused.'
25573	42	14	19	 "A second pleaded, "`I have bought five yoke of oxen, and am  on my way to try them. Pray hold me excused.'
25574	42	14	20	 "Another said, "`I am just married. It is impossible for me to come.'
25575	42	14	21	 "So the servant came and brought these answers to his master, and they stirred his anger. "`Go out quickly,' he said, `into the streets of the city--the wide ones and the narrow. You will see poor men, and crippled, blind, lame: fetch them all in here.'
25576	42	14	22	 "Soon the servant reported the result, saying, "`Sir, what you ordered is done, and there is room still.'
25577	42	14	23	 "`Go out,' replied the master, `to the high roads and hedge-rows, and compel the people to come in, so that my house may be filled.
25578	42	14	24	 For I tell you that not one of those who were invited shall taste my dinner.'"
25579	42	14	25	 On His journey vast crowds attended Him, towards whom He turned and said,
25580	42	14	26	  "If any one is coming to me who does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes and his own  life also, he cannot be a disciple of mine.
25581	42	14	27	 No one who does not carry his own cross and come after me can be a disciple of mine.
25582	42	14	28	 "Which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not sit down first and calculate the cost, asking if he has the means to finish it? --
25583	42	14	29	 lest perhaps, when he has laid the foundation and is unable to finish, all who see it shall begin to jeer at him,
25584	42	14	30	 saying, `This man began to build, but could not finish.'
25585	42	14	31	 Or what king,  marching to encounter another king in war, does not first sit down and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand men to meet the one who is advancing against him with twenty thousand?
25586	42	14	32	 If not, while the other is still a long way off, he sends  messengers and  sues for peace.
25587	42	14	33	  Just as no one of you who does not  detach himself from all that belongs to him can be a disciple of mine.
25588	42	14	34	  "Salt is good: but if even the salt has become tasteless, what will you use to season it?
25589	42	14	35	 Neither for land nor dunghill is it of any use; they throw it away. Listen, every one who has ears to listen with!"
25590	42	15	1	 Now the tax-gatherers and the notorious sinners were everywhere in the habit of coming close to Him to listen to Him;
25591	42	15	2	 and this led the Pharisees and the Scribes indignantly to complain, saying, "He gives a welcome to notorious sinners, and joins them at their meals!"
25592	42	15	3	  So in figurative language He asked them,
25593	42	15	4	 "Which of you men, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in their pasture and go in search of the lost one till he finds it?
25594	42	15	5	 And when he has found it, he lifts it on his shoulder, glad at heart.
25595	42	15	6	 Then coming home he calls his friends and neighbours together, and says,  `Congratulate me, for I have found my sheep--the one I had lost.'
25596	42	15	7	 I tell you that in the same way there will be rejoicing in Heaven over one repentant sinner--more rejoicing than over ninety-nine blameless persons who have no need of repentance.
25597	42	15	8	 "Or what woman who has ten silver coins, if she loses one of them, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully till she finds it?
25598	42	15	9	 And when she has found it, she calls together her  friends and neighbours, and says, "`Congratulate me, for I have found the coin which I had lost.'
25599	42	15	10	 "I tell you that in the same way there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one repentant sinner."
25600	42	15	11	 He went on to say, "There was a man who had two sons.
25601	42	15	12	 The younger of them said to his father, "`Father, give me the share of the property that comes to me.' "So he divided his wealth between them.
25602	42	15	13	 No long time afterwards the younger son got all together and travelled to a distant country, where he wasted his money in debauchery and excess.
25603	42	15	14	 At last, when he had spent everything, there came a terrible famine throughout that country, and  he began  to feel the pinch of want.
25604	42	15	15	 So he went and  hired himself to one of the inhabitants of that country, who sent him on to his farm to tend swine;
25605	42	15	16	 and he longed to make a hearty meal of the pods the swine were eating, but no one gave him any.
25606	42	15	17	 "But on coming to himself he said, "`How many of my father's hired men have more bread than they want, while I here am dying of hunger!
25607	42	15	18	 I will rise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before you:
25608	42	15	19	 I no longer deserve to be called a son of yours: treat me as one of your hired men.'
25609	42	15	20	 "So he rose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and pitied him, and ran and threw his arms round his neck and kissed him tenderly.
25610	42	15	21	 "`Father,' cried the son, `I have sinned against Heaven and before you: no longer do I deserve to be called a son of yours.'
25611	42	15	22	  "But the father said to his servants, "`Fetch a good coat quickly--the best one--and put it on him; and bring a ring for his finger and shoes for his feet.
25612	42	15	23	 Fetch the fat calf and kill it, and let us feast and enjoy ourselves;
25613	42	15	24	 for my son here was dead and has come to life again: he was lost and has been found.' "And they began to be merry.
25614	42	15	25	 "Now his elder son was out on the farm; and when he returned and came near home, he heard music and  dancing.
25615	42	15	26	 Then he called one of the lads to him and asked what all this meant.
25616	42	15	27	 "`Your brother has come,' he replied; `and your father has had the fat calf killed, because he has got him home safe and sound.'
25617	42	15	28	 "Then he was angry and would not go in. But his father came out and entreated him.
25618	42	15	29	 "`All these years,' replied the son, `I have been slaving for you, and I have never at any time  disobeyed any of your orders, and yet you have never given me so much as a kid, for me to enjoy myself with my friends;
25619	42	15	30	 but now that this son of yours is come who has eaten up your property among his bad women, you have killed the fat calf for him.'
25620	42	15	31	 "`You  my dear son,' said the father, `are always with me, and all that is mine is also yours.
25621	42	15	32	 We are bound to make merry and rejoice, for this brother of yours was dead and has come back to life, he was lost and has been found.'"
25622	42	16	1	 He said also to His disciples: "There was a rich man who had a steward, about whom a report was brought to him, that he was wasting his property.
25623	42	16	2	 He called him and said, "`What is this I hear about you? Render an account of your stewardship, for I cannot let you hold it any longer.'
25624	42	16	3	 "Then the steward said within himself, "`What am I to do? For my master is taking away the stewardship from me. I am not strong enough for field labour: to beg, I should be ashamed.
25625	42	16	4	 I see what to do, in order that when I am discharged from the stewardship they may give me a home in their own houses.'
25626	42	16	5	 "So he called all his master's debtors, one by one, and asked the first, `How much are you in debt to my master?'
25627	42	16	6	 "`A hundred  firkins of oil,' he replied. "`Here is your account,' said the steward: `sit down quickly and  change it into fifty firkins.'
25628	42	16	7	 "To a second he said, "`And how much do you owe?' "`A hundred  quarters of wheat,' was the answer. "`Here is your account,' said he:  `change it into eighty quarters.'
25629	42	16	8	 "And the master praised the dishonest steward for his shrewdness; for, in relation to their own contemporaries, the men of this age are shrewder than the sons of Light.
25630	42	16	9	 "But I charge you, so to use  the wealth which is ever tempting to dishonesty as to win friends who, when it fails, shall welcome you to the tents that never perish.
25631	42	16	10	 The man who is honest in a very small matter is honest in a great one also; and he who is dishonest in a very small matter is dishonest in a great one also.
25632	42	16	11	 If therefore you have not proved yourselves faithful in dealing with the  wealth that is  tainted with fraud, who will entrust to you the true good?
25633	42	16	12	 And if you have not been faithful in dealing with that which is not your own, who will give you that which is your own?
25634	42	16	13	 "No  servant can be in bondage to two masters. For either he will hate one and love the other, or else he will cling fast to one and scorn the other. You cannot be bondservants both of God and of  gold."
25635	42	16	14	 To all this the Pharisees listened,  bitterly jeering at Him; for they were lovers of money.
25636	42	16	15	 "You are they," He said to them, "who boast of their own goodness before men, but God sees your hearts; for that which holds a proud position among men is detestable in God's sight.
25637	42	16	16	 The Law and the Prophets continued until John came: from that time the Good News of the Kingdom of God  has been spreading, and all classes  have been forcing their way into it.
25638	42	16	17	  But it is easier for earth and sky to pass away than for one smallest detail of the Law to fall to the ground.
25639	42	16	18	 Every man who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery; and he who marries  her when so divorced from her husband commits adultery.
25640	42	16	19	 "There was once a rich man who habitually arrayed himself in purple and  fine linen, and enjoyed a splendid banquet every day,
25641	42	16	20	 while at his outer door there  lay a beggar, Lazarus by name,
25642	42	16	21	 covered with sores and longing to make a full meal off the  scraps flung on the floor from the rich man's table. Nay, the dogs, too, used to come and lick his sores.
25643	42	16	22	 "But in course of time the beggar died; and he was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died, and  had a funeral.
25644	42	16	23	 And in Hades, being in torment, he looked and saw Abraham in the far distance, and Lazarus resting in his  arms.
25645	42	16	24	 So he cried aloud, and said, "`Father Abraham, take pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame.'
25646	42	16	25	 "`Remember, my child,' said Abraham, `that you had all your good things during your lifetime, and that Lazarus in like manner had his bad things. But, now and here, he is receiving consolation and you are in agony.
25647	42	16	26	 And, besides all this, a vast chasm is immovably fixed between us and you, put there in order that those who desire to cross from this side to you may not be able, nor any be able to cross over from your side to us.'
25648	42	16	27	 "`I entreat you then, father,' said he, `to send him to my father's house.
25649	42	16	28	 For I have five brothers. Let him earnestly warn them, lest they also come to this place of torment.'
25650	42	16	29	 "`They have Moses and the Prophets,' replied Abraham; `let them hear them.'
25651	42	16	30	 "`No, father Abraham,' he pleaded; `but if some one  goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'
25652	42	16	31	 "`If they are deaf to Moses and the Prophets,' replied Abraham, `they would not be led to believe even if some one should rise from the dead.'"
25653	42	17	1	  Jesus said to His disciples, "It is inevitable that causes of stumbling should come; but alas for him through whom they come!
25654	42	17	2	 It would be well for him if, with a  millstone round his neck, he were lying at the bottom of the sea, rather than that he should cause even one of these little ones to fall.
25655	42	17	3	  Be on your guard. "If your brother acts wrongly, reprove him; and if he is sorry, forgive him;
25656	42	17	4	 and if seven times in a day he acts wrongly towards you, and seven times turns again to you and says, `I am sorry,' you must forgive him."
25657	42	17	5	 And the Apostles said to the Lord, "Give us faith."
25658	42	17	6	 "If your faith," replied the Lord, "is like a mustard seed, you might command this black-mulberry-tree, `Tear up your roots and plant yourself in the sea,' and instantly it would obey you.
25659	42	17	7	 But which of you who has a  servant ploughing, or tending sheep, will say to him when he comes in from the farm, `Come at once and take your place at table,'
25660	42	17	8	 and will not rather say to him, `Get my dinner ready, make yourself tidy, and wait upon me till I have finished my dinner, and then you shall have yours'?
25661	42	17	9	 Does he thank the  servant for obeying his orders?
25662	42	17	10	 So you also, when you have obeyed all the orders given you, must say, "`There is no merit in our service: what we have done is  only what we were in duty bound to do.'"
25663	42	17	11	 As  they pursued their journey to Jerusalem, He passed through Samaria and Galilee.
25664	42	17	12	 And as He entered a certain village, ten men met Him who were lepers and stood at a distance.
25665	42	17	13	 In loud voices they cried out, "Jesus, Rabbi, take pity on us."
25666	42	17	14	 Perceiving this, He said to them, "Go and show yourselves to the Priests." And while on their way to do this they were made clean.
25667	42	17	15	 One of them, seeing that he was cured, came back, adoring and praising God in a loud voice,
25668	42	17	16	 and he threw himself at the feet of Jesus, thanking Him. He was a Samaritan.
25669	42	17	17	 "Were not all ten made clean?" Jesus asked; "but where are the nine?
25670	42	17	18	 Have none been found to come back and give glory to God except this foreigner?"
25671	42	17	19	 And He said to him, "Rise and go: your faith has cured you."
25672	42	17	20	  Being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God was coming, He answered, "The Kingdom of God does not so come that you can  stealthily watch for it.
25673	42	17	21	 Nor will they say, `See here!' or `See there!' --for the Kingdom of God is  within you."
25674	42	17	22	 Then, turning to His disciples, He said, "There will come a time when you will wish you could see a single one of the days of the Son of Man, but will not see one.
25675	42	17	23	  And they will say to you, `See there!' `See here!' Do not start off and go in pursuit.
25676	42	17	24	 For just as the lightning, when it flashes, shines from one part of the horizon to the opposite part, so will the Son of Man be on His day.
25677	42	17	25	 But  first He must endure much suffering, and be rejected by the present generation.
25678	42	17	26	 "And as it was in the time of Noah, so will it also be in the time of the Son of Man.
25679	42	17	27	 Men were eating and drinking, taking wives and giving wives, up to the very day on which Noah entered the Ark, and the Deluge came and destroyed them all.
25680	42	17	28	 The same was true in the time of Lot: they were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building;
25681	42	17	29	 but on the day that Lot left Sodom, God rained fire and brimstone from the sky and destroyed them all.
25682	42	17	30	 Exactly so will it be on the day that the veil is lifted from the Son of Man.
25683	42	17	31	 "On that day, if a man is on the roof and his  property indoors, let him not go down to fetch it; and, in the same way, he who is in the field, let him not turn back.
25684	42	17	32	 Remember Lot's wife.
25685	42	17	33	 Any man who makes it his object to keep his own  life safe, will lose it; but whoever loses his  life will  preserve it.
25686	42	17	34	  On that night, I tell you, there will be two men in one bed: one will be  taken away and the other left behind.
25687	42	17	35	 There will be two women turning the mill together: one will be  taken away and the other left behind."
25688	42	17	36	  []
25689	42	17	37	 "Where, Master?" they inquired. "Where the dead body is," He replied, "there also will the vultures flock together."
25690	42	18	1	  He also taught them by a parable that they must always pray and never lose heart.
25691	42	18	2	 "In a certain town," He said, "there was a judge who had no fear of God and no respect for man.
25692	42	18	3	 And in the same town was a widow who repeatedly came and entreated him, saying, "`Give me justice and stop my oppressor.'
25693	42	18	4	 "For a time he would not, but afterwards he said to himself, "`Though I have neither reverence for God nor respect for man,
25694	42	18	5	 yet because she annoys me I will give her justice, to prevent her from  constantly coming to pester me.'"
25695	42	18	6	 And the Lord said, "Hear those words of the unjust judge.
25696	42	18	7	  And will not God avenge the wrongs of His own People who cry aloud to Him day and night, although He seems slow in taking action on their behalf?
25697	42	18	8	 Yes, He will soon avenge their wrongs. Yet, when the Son of Man  comes, will He find  faith on earth?"
25698	42	18	9	 And to some who relied on themselves as being righteous men, and looked down upon all others, He addressed this parable.
25699	42	18	10	 "Two men went up to the Temple to pray," He said; "one being a Pharisee and the other a tax-gatherer.
25700	42	18	11	 The Pharisee, standing erect, prayed as follows  by himself: "`O God, I thank Thee that I am not like other people--I am not a thief nor a cheat nor an adulterer, nor do I even resemble this tax-gatherer.
25701	42	18	12	 I fast twice a week. I pay the tithe on all my gains.'
25702	42	18	13	 "But the tax-gatherer, standing far back, would not so much as lift his eyes to Heaven, but kept beating his breast and saying, "`O God,  be reconciled to me, sinner that I am.'
25703	42	18	14	 "I tell you that this man went home more thoroughly absolved from guilt than the other; for every one who uplifts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be uplifted."
25704	42	18	15	  On one occasion  people also brought with them their infants, for Him to touch them; but the disciples, noticing this, proceeded to find fault with them.
25705	42	18	16	 Jesus however called the infants to Him. "Let the little children come to me," He said; "do not hinder them; for it is to those who are childlike that the Kingdom of God belongs.
25706	42	18	17	 I tell you in solemn truth that, whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child will certainly not enter it."
25707	42	18	18	  The question was put to Him by a Ruler: "Good Rabbi, what shall I do to inherit the Life of the Ages?"
25708	42	18	19	 "Why do you call me good?" replied Jesus; "there is no one good but One, namely God.
25709	42	18	20	 You know the Commandments: <`Do not commit adultery;' `Do not murder;' `Do not steal;' `Do not lie in giving evidence;' `Honour thy father and thy mother.'">
25710	42	18	21	 "All of those," he replied, "I have kept from my youth."
25711	42	18	22	 On receiving this answer Jesus said to him, "There is still one thing wanting in you. Sell everything you possess and give the money to the poor, and you shall have wealth in Heaven; and then come, follow me."
25712	42	18	23	 But on hearing these words he was deeply sorrowful, for he was exceedingly rich.
25713	42	18	24	 Jesus saw his sorrow, and said, "With how hard a struggle do the possessors of riches ever enter the Kingdom of God!
25714	42	18	25	 Why, it is easier for a camel to go through a  needle's eye than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God."
25715	42	18	26	 "Who then can be saved?" exclaimed the hearers.
25716	42	18	27	 "Things impossible with man," He replied, "are possible with God."
25717	42	18	28	 Then Peter said, "See, we have given up our  homes and have followed you."
25718	42	18	29	 "I solemnly tell you," replied Jesus, "that there is no one who has left house or wife, or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of God's Kingdom,
25719	42	18	30	 who shall not certainly receive many times as much  in this life, and in the age that is coming the Life of the Ages."
25720	42	18	31	  Then He drew the Twelve to Him and said, "See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything written in the Prophets which refers to the Son of Man will be fulfilled.
25721	42	18	32	 For He will be given up to the Gentiles, and be mocked, outraged and spit upon.
25722	42	18	33	 They will scourge Him and put Him to death, and on the third day He will rise to life again."
25723	42	18	34	 Nothing of this did they understand. The words were a mystery to them, nor could they see what He meant.
25724	42	18	35	  As Jesus came near to Jericho, there was a blind man sitting by the way-side begging.
25725	42	18	36	 He heard a crowd of people going past, and inquired what it all meant.
25726	42	18	37	 "Jesus the Nazarene is passing by," they told him.
25727	42	18	38	 Then, at the top of his voice, he cried out, "Jesus, son of David, take pity on me."
25728	42	18	39	 Those in front reproved him and tried to silence him; but he continued shouting, louder than ever, "Son of David, take pity on me."
25729	42	18	40	 At length Jesus stopped and desired them to bring the man to Him; and when he had come close to Him He asked him,
25730	42	18	41	 "What shall I do for you?" "Sir," he replied, "let me recover my sight."
25731	42	18	42	 "Recover your sight," said Jesus: "your faith has cured you."
25732	42	18	43	 No sooner were the words spoken than the man regained his sight and followed Jesus, giving glory to God; and all the people, seeing it, gave praise to God.
25733	42	19	1	 So He entered Jericho and was passing through the town.
25734	42	19	2	 There was a man there called Zacchaeus, who was the local surveyor of taxes, and was wealthy.
25735	42	19	3	 He was anxious to see what sort of man Jesus was; but he could not because of the crowd, for he was short in stature.
25736	42	19	4	 So he ran on in front and climbed up a mulberry tree to see Him; for He was about to pass that way.
25737	42	19	5	 As soon as Jesus came to the place, He looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, come down quickly, for I must stay at your house to-day."
25738	42	19	6	 So he came down in haste, and welcomed Him joyfully.
25739	42	19	7	 When they all saw this, they began to complain with indignation. "He has gone in to be the guest of a notorious sinner!" they said.
25740	42	19	8	 Zacchaeus however stood up, and addressing the Lord said,  "Here and now, Master, I give half my  property to the poor, and if I have unjustly exacted money from any man, I pledge myself to repay to him four times the amount."
25741	42	19	9	 Turning towards him, Jesus replied, "To-day salvation has come to this house, seeing that he too is a son of Abraham.
25742	42	19	10	 For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost."
25743	42	19	11	  As they were listening to His words, He went on to teach them by a parable, because He was near to Jerusalem and they supposed that the Kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.
25744	42	19	12	 So He said to them, "A man of noble family travelled to a distant country to obtain the rank of king, and to return.
25745	42	19	13	 And he called ten of his  servants and gave each of them  a pound, instructing them to trade with the money  during his absence.
25746	42	19	14	 "Now his countrymen hated him, and sent a deputation after him to say, `We are not willing that he should become our king.'
25747	42	19	15	 And upon his return, after he had obtained the sovereignty, he ordered those servants to whom he had given the money to be summoned before him, that he might learn their success in trading.
25748	42	19	16	 "So the first came and said, "`Sir, your pound has produced ten pounds more.'
25749	42	19	17	 "`Well done, good servant,' he replied; `because you have been faithful in a very small matter, be in authority over ten towns.'
25750	42	19	18	 "The second came, and said, "`Your pound, Sir, has produced five pounds.'
25751	42	19	19	 "So he said to this one also, "`And you, be the governor of five towns.'
25752	42	19	20	 "The next came. "`Sir,' he said, `here is your pound, which I have kept wrapt up in a cloth.
25753	42	19	21	 For I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man: you take up what you did not lay down, and you reap what you did not sow.'
25754	42	19	22	 "`By your own words,' he replied, `I will judge you, you bad servant. You knew me to be a severe man, taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow:
25755	42	19	23	 why then did you not put my money into a bank, that when I came I might have received it back with interest?
25756	42	19	24	 "And he said to those who stood by, "`Take the pound from him and give it to him who has the ten pounds.'
25757	42	19	25	 ("They said to him, "`Sir, he already has ten pounds.')
25758	42	19	26	 "`I tell you that to every one who has anything, more shall be given; and from him who has not anything, even what he has shall be taken away.
25759	42	19	27	 But as for those enemies of mine who were unwilling that I should become their king, bring them here, and cut them to pieces in my presence.'"
25760	42	19	28	 After thus speaking, He journeyed onward, proceeding up to Jerusalem.
25761	42	19	29	  And when he was come near Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount called  the Oliveyard, He sent two of the disciples on in front,
25762	42	19	30	 saying to them, "Go into the village facing you. On entering it you will find an ass's foal tied up which no one has ever yet ridden: untie it, and bring it here.
25763	42	19	31	 And if any one asks you, `Why are you untying the colt?' simply say,  `The Master needs it.'"
25764	42	19	32	 So those who were sent went and found things as He had told them.
25765	42	19	33	 And while they were untying the colt the owners called out, "Why are you untying the colt?"
25766	42	19	34	 and they replied,  "The Master needs it."
25767	42	19	35	 Then they brought it to Jesus, and after throwing their outer garments on the colt they placed Jesus on it.
25768	42	19	36	 So He rode on, while they carpeted the road with their garments.
25769	42	19	37	 And when He was now getting near Jerusalem, and descending the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began in their joy to praise God in loud voices for all the mighty deeds they had witnessed.
25770	42	19	38	 <"Blessed is> the King," they cried, <"who comes in the name of the Lord:> in Heaven peace, and glory in the highest realms."
25771	42	19	39	 Thereupon some of the Pharisees in the crowd appealed to Him, saying,  "Rabbi, reprove your disciples."
25772	42	19	40	 "I tell you," He replied, "that if *they* became silent, the very stones would cry out."
25773	42	19	41	 When He came into full view of the city, He wept aloud over it, and exclaimed,
25774	42	19	42	 "O that at this time thou hadst known--yes even thou--what makes peace possible! But now it is hid from thine eyes.
25775	42	19	43	 For the time is coming upon thee when thy foes will throw up around thee  earthworks and a wall, investing thee and hemming thee in on every side.
25776	42	19	44	 And they will dash thee to the ground and thy children within thee, and will not leave one stone upon another within thee; because thou hast not recognized the time of thy visitation."
25777	42	19	45	  Then Jesus entered the Temple and proceeded to drive out the dealers.
25778	42	19	46	 "It is written," He said, <"`And My house shall be the House of Prayer,'> but you have made it <a robbers' cave.">
25779	42	19	47	 And day after day He taught in the Temple, while the High Priests and the Scribes were devising some means of destroying Him, as were also the leading men of the people.
25780	42	19	48	 But they could not find any way of doing it, for the people all hung upon His lips.
25781	42	20	1	  On one of those days while He was teaching the people in the Temple and proclaiming the Good News, the High Priests came upon Him, and the Scribes,
25782	42	20	2	 together with the Elders, and they asked Him, "Tell us, By what authority are you doing these things? And who is it that gave you this authority?"
25783	42	20	3	 "I also will put a question to you, "He said;
25784	42	20	4	 "was John's baptism of Heavenly or of human origin?"
25785	42	20	5	 So they debated the matter with one another. "If we say `Heavenly,'" they argued, "he will say, `Why did you not believe him?'
25786	42	20	6	 And if we say, `human,' the people will all stone us; for they are thoroughly convinced that John was a Prophet."
25787	42	20	7	 And they answered that they did not know the origin of it.
25788	42	20	8	 "Nor will I tell you," said Jesus, "by what authority I do these things."
25789	42	20	9	  Then He proceeded to speak a parable to the people. "There was a man," He said, "who planted a vineyard, let it out to vine-dressers, and went abroad for a considerable time.
25790	42	20	10	 At vintage-time he sent a  servant to the vine-dressers, for them to give him a share of the crop; but the vine-dressers beat him cruelly and sent him away empty-handed.
25791	42	20	11	 Then he sent a second  servant; and him too they beat and ill treated and sent away empty-handed.
25792	42	20	12	 Then again he sent a third; and this one also they wounded and drove away.
25793	42	20	13	 Then the owner of the vineyard said, "`What am I to do? I will send my son--my dearly-loved son: they will probably respect him.'
25794	42	20	14	 "But when the vine-dressers saw him, they discussed the matter with one another, and said, "`This is the heir: let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.'
25795	42	20	15	 "So they turned him out of the vineyard and murdered him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
25796	42	20	16	 He will come and put these vine-dressers to death, and give the vineyard to others."  "God forbid!" exclaimed the hearers.
25797	42	20	17	 He looked at them and said, "What then does that mean which is written, <"`The Stone which the builders rejected has been made the cornerstone'?>
25798	42	20	18	 Every one who falls on that stone will be severely hurt, but on whomsoever it falls, he will be utterly crushed."
25799	42	20	19	 At this the Scribes and the High Priests wanted to lay hands on Him,  then and there; only they were afraid of the people. For they saw that in this parable He had referred to them.
25800	42	20	20	  So, after impatiently watching their opportunity, they sent spies who were to act the part of good and honest men, that they might fasten on some expression of His, so as to hand Him over to the ruling power and the Governor's authority.
25801	42	20	21	 So they put a question to Him.  "Rabbi," they said, "we know that you say and teach what is right and that  you make no distinctions between one man and another, but teach God's way truly.
25802	42	20	22	 Is it allowable to pay a tax to Caesar, or not?"
25803	42	20	23	 But He saw through their knavery and replied,
25804	42	20	24	 "Show me a shilling; whose likeness and inscription does it bear?" "Caesar's," they said.
25805	42	20	25	 "Pay therefore," He replied, "what is Caesar's to Caesar--and what is God's to God."
25806	42	20	26	 There was nothing here that they could lay hold of before the people, and marvelling at His answer they said no more.
25807	42	20	27	  Next some of the Sadducees came forward (who deny that there is a Resurrection), and they asked Him,
25808	42	20	28	  "Rabbi, Moses made it a law for us that if a man's brother should die, leaving a wife but no children, the man shall marry the widow and raise up a family for his brother.
25809	42	20	29	 Now there were seven brothers. The first of them took a wife and died childless.
25810	42	20	30	 The second and the third also took her;
25811	42	20	31	 and all seven, having done the same, left no children when they died.
25812	42	20	32	 Finally the woman also died.
25813	42	20	33	 The woman, then--at the Resurrection--whose wife shall she be? for they all seven married her."
25814	42	20	34	 "The  men of this age," replied Jesus, "marry, and the women are given in marriage.
25815	42	20	35	 But as for those who  shall have been deemed worthy to find a place in that other age and in the Resurrection from among the dead, the men do not marry and the women are not given in marriage.
25816	42	20	36	 For indeed they cannot die again; they are like angels, and are sons of God through being sons of the Resurrection.
25817	42	20	37	 But that the dead  rise to life even Moses clearly  implies in the passage about the Bush, where he calls the Lord <`The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'>
25818	42	20	38	 He is not a God of dead, but of living men, for to Him are all living."
25819	42	20	39	 Then some of the Scribes replied, "Rabbi, you have spoken well."
25820	42	20	40	 From that time,  however, no one ventured to challenge Him with a single question.
25821	42	20	41	  But He asked them, "How is it they say that the Christ is a son of David?
25822	42	20	42	 Why, David himself says in the Book of Psalms, <"`The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand
25823	42	20	43	 Until I have made thy foes a footstool under they feet.'>
25824	42	20	44	 "David himself therefore calls Him Lord, and how can He be his son?"
25825	42	20	45	  Then, in the hearing of all the people, He said to the disciples,
25826	42	20	46	 "Beware of the Scribes, who like to walk about in long robes, and love to be bowed to in places of public resort and to occupy the best seats in the synagogues or at a dinner party;
25827	42	20	47	 who swallow up the property of widows and mask their wickedness by making long prayers. They will be punished far more severely than others."
25828	42	21	1	  Looking up He saw the people throwing their gifts into the Treasury--the rich people.
25829	42	21	2	 He also saw a poor widow dropping in two farthings,
25830	42	21	3	 and He said, "In truth I tell you that this widow, so poor, has thrown in more than any of them.
25831	42	21	4	 For from what they could well spare they have all of them contributed to the offerings, but she in her need has thrown in all she had to live on."
25832	42	21	5	  When some were remarking about the Temple, how it was embellished with beautiful stones and dedicated gifts, He said,
25833	42	21	6	 "As to these things which you now admire, the time is coming when there will not be one stone left here upon another which will not be pulled down."
25834	42	21	7	  "Rabbi, when will this be?" they asked Him, "and what will be the token given when these things are about to take place?"
25835	42	21	8	 "See to it," He replied, "that you are not misled; for many will come  assuming my name and professing, `I am He,' or saying, `The time is close at hand.' Do not go and follow them.
25836	42	21	9	 But when you hear of wars and turmoils, be not afraid; for these things must happen first, but the end does not come immediately."
25837	42	21	10	 Then He said to them, <"Nation will rise in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.>
25838	42	21	11	 And there will be great earthquakes, and in places famines and pestilence; and there will be terrible sights and wonderful tokens from Heaven.
25839	42	21	12	 "But before all these things happen they will lay hands on you and persecute you. They will deliver you up to synagogues and to prison, and you will be brought before kings and governors for my sake.
25840	42	21	13	 In the end all this will be evidence of your fidelity.
25841	42	21	14	 "Make up your minds, however, not to prepare a defence beforehand,
25842	42	21	15	 for I will give you utterance and wisdom which none of your opponents will be able to withstand or reply to.
25843	42	21	16	 You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers, relatives, friends; and some of you they will put to death.
25844	42	21	17	 You will be the objects of universal hatred because you are called by my name;
25845	42	21	18	 and yet not a hair of your heads shall perish.
25846	42	21	19	 By your patient endurance you will purchase your  lives.
25847	42	21	20	  "But when you see Jerusalem with armies encamping round her on every side, then be certain that her  overthrow is close at hand.
25848	42	21	21	 Then let those who shall be in Judaea escape to the hills; let those who are in the city leave it, and those who are in the country not enter in.
25849	42	21	22	 For those are the <days of vengeance> and  of fulfilling all that is written.
25850	42	21	23	 "Alas for the women who at that time are with child or who have infants; for there will be great distress  in the land, and anger towards this People.
25851	42	21	24	 They will fall  by the sword, or be carried off into slavery among all the Gentiles.  And Jerusalem will be trampled under foot by the  Gentiles, till the appointed times of the  Gentiles have expired.
25852	42	21	25	 "There will be  signs in sun, moon, and stars; and on earth anguish among the nations in their bewilderment at the roaring of the sea and its billows;
25853	42	21	26	 while men's hearts are fainting for fear, and for anxious expectation of what is coming on the world. For <the  forces which control the heavens will be disordered and disturbed.>
25854	42	21	27	 And then will they  see the <Son of Man coming in a cloud>  with great power and glory.
25855	42	21	28	 But when all this is beginning to take place, grieve no longer. Lift up your heads, because your  deliverance is drawing near."
25856	42	21	29	 And He spoke a parable to them. "See," He said, "the fig-tree and all the trees.
25857	42	21	30	 As soon as they have shot out their leaves, you know at a glance that summer is now near.
25858	42	21	31	 So also, when you see these things happening, you may be sure that the Kingdom of God is near.
25859	42	21	32	 I tell you in solemn truth that the present generation will certainly not pass away without all these things having first taken place.
25860	42	21	33	 Earth and sky will pass away, but it is certain that my words will not pass away.
25861	42	21	34	 "But take heed to yourselves, lest your  souls be weighed down with  self-indulgence and drunkenness or the anxieties of this life, and that day come upon you, suddenly, like a falling trap;
25862	42	21	35	 for it will come on all dwellers on the face of the whole  earth.
25863	42	21	36	 But beware of slumbering; and every moment pray that you may be fully strengthened to escape from all these coming evils, and to take your stand in the presence of the Son of Man."
25864	42	21	37	  His habit at this time was to teach in the Temple by day, but to go out and spend the night on the Mount called  the Oliveyard.
25865	42	21	38	 And all the people came to Him in the Temple, early in the morning, to listen to Him.
25866	42	22	1	  Meanwhile the Festival of the Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching,
25867	42	22	2	 and the High Priests and the Scribes were contriving how to destroy Him.  But they feared the people.
25868	42	22	3	  Satan, however, entered into Judas (the man called Iscariot) who was one of the Twelve.
25869	42	22	4	 He went and conferred with the High Priests and  Commanders as to how he should deliver Him up to them.
25870	42	22	5	 This gave them great pleasure, and they agreed to pay him.
25871	42	22	6	 He accepted their offer, and then looked out for an opportunity to betray Him when the people were not there.
25872	42	22	7	  When the day of the Unleavened Bread came--the day for the Passover lamb to be sacrificed--
25873	42	22	8	 Jesus sent Peter and John with instructions. "Go," He said, "and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat it."
25874	42	22	9	 "Where shall we prepare it?" they asked.
25875	42	22	10	 "You will no sooner have entered the city," He replied, "than you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him into the house to which he goes,
25876	42	22	11	 and say to the master of the house, "`The  Rabbi asks you, Where is the room where I can eat the Passover with my disciples?'
25877	42	22	12	 "And he will show you a large furnished room upstairs. There make your preparations."
25878	42	22	13	 So they went and found all as He had told them; and they got the Passover ready.
25879	42	22	14	  When the time was come, and He had taken His place at table, and the Apostles with Him,
25880	42	22	15	 He said to them, "Earnestly have I longed to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;
25881	42	22	16	  for I tell you that I certainly shall not eat one again till its full meaning has been brought out in the Kingdom of God."
25882	42	22	17	 Then, having  received the cup and given thanks, He said, "Take this and share it among yourselves;
25883	42	22	18	 for I tell you that from this time I will never drink the  produce of the vine till the Kingdom of God has come."
25884	42	22	19	  Then, taking a Passover biscuit, He gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body which  is being given on your behalf: this do in remembrance of me."
25885	42	22	20	 He gave them the cup in like manner, when  the meal was over. "This cup," He said, "is the new Covenant ratified  by my blood which  is to be poured out on your behalf.
25886	42	22	21	  Yet the hand of him who is betraying me is at the table with me.
25887	42	22	22	 For indeed the Son of Man goes on His way--His pre-destined way; yet alas for that man who is betraying Him!"
25888	42	22	23	 Thereupon they began to discuss with one another which of them it could possibly be who was about to do this.
25889	42	22	24	  There arose also a dispute among them which of them should be  regarded as greatest.
25890	42	22	25	 But He said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles are their masters, and those who exercise authority over them are called Benefactors.
25891	42	22	26	 With you it is not so; but let the greatest among you be as the younger, and the leader be like him who serves.
25892	42	22	27	 For which is the greater--he who sits at table, or he who waits on him? Is it not he who sits at table? But my position among you is that of one who waits on others.
25893	42	22	28	 You however have remained with me amid my trials;
25894	42	22	29	 and I covenant to give you, as my Father has covenanted to give me, a Kingdom--
25895	42	22	30	 so that you shall eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom, and sit on thrones as judges over the twelve tribes of Israel.
25896	42	22	31	  "Simon, Simon, I tell you that Satan has  obtained permission to have all of you to sift as wheat is sifted.
25897	42	22	32	 But *I* have prayed  for *you* that your faith may not fail, and  you, when at last you have come back to your true self, must strengthen your brethren."
25898	42	22	33	 "Master," replied Peter, "with you I am ready to go both to prison and to death."
25899	42	22	34	 "I tell you, Peter," said Jesus, "that the cock will not crow to-day till you have three times denied that you know me."
25900	42	22	35	 Then He asked them, "When I sent you out without purse or bag or shoes, was there anything you needed?" "No, nothing," they replied.
25901	42	22	36	 "But now," said He, "let the one who has a purse take it, and he who has a bag must do the same. And let him who has no sword sell his outer garment and  buy one.
25902	42	22	37	 For I tell you that those words of Scripture must yet find their fulfilment in me: <`And He was reckoned among the lawless';> for indeed that saying about me has its accomplishment."
25903	42	22	38	 "Master, here are two swords," they exclaimed. "That is enough," He replied.
25904	42	22	39	  On going out, He proceeded as usual to the Mount of Olives, and His disciples followed Him.
25905	42	22	40	  But when He arrived at the place, He said to them,  "Pray that you may not come into temptation."
25906	42	22	41	 But He Himself withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and knelt down and prayed repeatedly, saying,
25907	42	22	42	 "Father, if it be Thy will,  take this  cup away from me; yet not my will but Thine be done!"
25908	42	22	43	 And there appeared to Him an angel from Heaven, strengthening Him;
25909	42	22	44	 while He--an agony of distress having come upon Him--prayed all the more with intense earnestness, and His sweat became like clots of blood dropping on the ground.
25910	42	22	45	 When He rose from his prayer and came to His disciples, He found them sleeping for sorrow.
25911	42	22	46	 "Why are you sleeping?" He said;  "stand up; and pray that you may not come into temptation."
25912	42	22	47	  While He was still speaking there came a crowd with Judas, already mentioned as one of the Twelve, at their head. He went up to Jesus to kiss Him.
25913	42	22	48	 "Judas," said Jesus, "are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"
25914	42	22	49	 Those who were about Him, seeing what was likely to happen, asked Him, "Master, shall we strike with the sword?"
25915	42	22	50	 And one of them struck a blow at the High Priest's  servant and cut off his right ear.
25916	42	22	51	 "Permit me thus far," said Jesus. And He touched the ear and healed it.
25917	42	22	52	 Then Jesus said to the High Priests and Commanders of the Temple and Elders, who had come to arrest Him, "Have you come out as if to fight with a robber, with swords and cudgels?
25918	42	22	53	 While day after day I was with you in the Temple, you did not lay hands upon me; but to you belongs this hour--and the power of darkness."
25919	42	22	54	  And they arrested Him and led Him away, and brought Him to the High Priest's house, while Peter followed a good way behind.
25920	42	22	55	 And when they had lighted a fire in the middle of the court and had seated themselves in a group round it, Peter was sitting among them,
25921	42	22	56	 when a maidservant saw him sitting  by the fire, and, looking fixedly at him, she said, "This man also was with him."
25922	42	22	57	 But he denied it, and declared, "Woman, I do not know him."
25923	42	22	58	 Shortly afterwards a man saw him and said, "You, too, are one of them." "No, man, I am not," said Peter.
25924	42	22	59	 After an interval of about an hour some one else stoutly maintained: "Certainly this fellow also was with him, for in fact he is a Galilaean."
25925	42	22	60	 "Man, I don't know what you mean," replied Peter. No sooner had he spoken than a cock crowed.
25926	42	22	61	 The Master turned and looked on Peter; and Peter recollected the Master's words, how He had said to him, "This very day, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times."
25927	42	22	62	 And he went out and wept aloud bitterly.
25928	42	22	63	  Meanwhile the men who held Jesus in custody repeatedly beat Him in cruel sport,
25929	42	22	64	 or blindfolded Him, and then challenged Him. "Prove to us," they said, "that you are a prophet, by telling us who it was that struck you."
25930	42	22	65	 And they said many other insulting things to Him.
25931	42	22	66	 As soon as it was day, the whole body of the Elders, both High Priests and Scribes, assembled. Then He was brought into their Sanhedrin, and they asked Him,
25932	42	22	67	 "Are you the Christ? Tell us." "If I tell you," He replied, "you will certainly not believe;
25933	42	22	68	 and if I ask you questions, you will certainly not answer.
25934	42	22	69	 But from this time forward the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of God's omnipotence."
25935	42	22	70	 Thereupon they cried out with one voice, "You, then, are the Son of God?" "It is as you say," He answered;  "I am He."
25936	42	22	71	 "What need have we of further evidence?" they said; "for we ourselves have heard it from his own lips."
25937	42	23	1	  Then the whole assembly rose and brought Him to Pilate, and began to accuse Him.
25938	42	23	2	 "We have found this man," they said, "an agitator among our nation, forbidding the payment of tribute to Caesar, and claiming to be himself  an anointed king."
25939	42	23	3	  Then Pilate asked Him, "You, then, are the King of the Jews?" "It is as you say," He replied.
25940	42	23	4	 Pilate said to the High Priests and to the crowd, "I can find no crime in this man."
25941	42	23	5	 But they violently insisted. "He stirs up the people," they said, "throughout all Judaea with His teaching--even from Galilee (where He first started) to this city."
25942	42	23	6	 On hearing this, Pilate inquired, "Is this man a Galilaean?"
25943	42	23	7	 And learning that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction he  sent Him to Herod, for he too was in Jerusalem at that time.
25944	42	23	8	 To Herod the sight of Jesus was a great gratification, for, for a long time, he had been wanting to see Him, because he had heard so much about Him. He hoped also to see some  miracle performed by Him.
25945	42	23	9	 So he put a number of questions to Him, but Jesus gave him no reply.
25946	42	23	10	 Meanwhile the High Priests and the Scribes were standing there and vehemently accusing Him.
25947	42	23	11	 Then, laughing to scorn the claims of Jesus, Herod (and his soldiers with him) made sport of Him, dressed Him in a gorgeous costume, and sent Him back to Pilate.
25948	42	23	12	 And on that very day Herod and Pilate became friends again, for they had been for some time at enmity.
25949	42	23	13	 Then calling together the High Priests and the Rulers and the people, Pilate said,
25950	42	23	14	 "You have brought this man to me on a charge of corrupting the loyalty of the people. But, you see, I have examined him in your presence and have discovered in the man no ground for the accusations which you bring against him.
25951	42	23	15	 No, nor does Herod; for  he has sent him back to us; and, you see, there is nothing he has done that deserves death.
25952	42	23	16	 I will therefore give him a light punishment and release him."
25953	42	23	17	  []
25954	42	23	18	  Then the whole multitude burst out into a shout. "Away with this man," they said, "and release Barabbas to us"
25955	42	23	19	 --Barabbas! who had been lodged in jail for some time in connexion with a riot which had occurred in the city, and for murder.
25956	42	23	20	 But Pilate once more addressed them, wishing to set Jesus free.
25957	42	23	21	 They, however, persistently shouted, "Crucify, crucify him!"
25958	42	23	22	 A third time he appealed to them:  "Why, what crime has the man committed? I have discovered in him nothing that deserves death. I will therefore give him a light punishment and release him."
25959	42	23	23	 But they urgently insisted, demanding with frantic outcries that He should be crucified; and their clamour prevailed.
25960	42	23	24	  So Pilate gave judgement, yielding to their demand.
25961	42	23	25	 The man who was lying in prison charged with riot and murder and for whom they clamoured he set free, but Jesus he gave up to be dealt with as they desired.
25962	42	23	26	  As soon as they led Him away, they laid hold on one Simon, a Cyrenaean, who was coming in from the country, and on his shoulders they put the cross, for him to carry it behind Jesus.
25963	42	23	27	 A vast crowd of the people also followed Him, and of women who were beating their breasts and wailing for Him.
25964	42	23	28	 But Jesus turned towards them and said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
25965	42	23	29	 For a time is coming when they will say, `Blessed are the women who never bore children, and the breasts which have never given nourishment.'
25966	42	23	30	  Then will they begin to say to the mountains, `Fall on us;' and to the hills, `Cover us.'
25967	42	23	31	 For if they are doing these things in the case of the green tree, what will be done in that of the dry?"
25968	42	23	32	 They brought also two others, criminals, to put them to death with Him.
25969	42	23	33	  When they reached the place called `The Skull,' there they nailed Him to the cross, and the criminals also, one at His right hand and one at His left.
25970	42	23	34	 Jesus prayed, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing." And they divided His garments among them, drawing lots for them;
25971	42	23	35	  and the people stood looking on. The Rulers, too, repeatedly uttered their bitter taunts. "This fellow," they said, "saved others: let him save himself, if he is God's Anointed, the Chosen One."
25972	42	23	36	 And the soldiers also made sport of Him, coming and offering Him  sour wine and saying,
25973	42	23	37	 "Are *you* the King of the Jews? Save yourself, then!"
25974	42	23	38	 There was moreover a writing over His head: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
25975	42	23	39	 Now one of the criminals who had been crucified insulted Him, saying, "Are not you the Christ? Save yourself and us."
25976	42	23	40	 But the other, answering, reproved him.  "Do you also not fear God," he said, "when you are actually suffering the same punishment?
25977	42	23	41	 And we indeed are suffering justly, for we are receiving due requital for what we have done. But He has done nothing amiss."
25978	42	23	42	 And he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come  in your Kingdom."
25979	42	23	43	 "I tell you in solemn truth," replied Jesus, "that  this very day you shall be with me in Paradise."
25980	42	23	44	  It was now about noon, and a darkness came over the whole country till three o'clock in the  afternoon.
25981	42	23	45	  The sun was darkened, and the curtain of the Sanctuary was torn down the middle,
25982	42	23	46	 and Jesus cried out in a loud voice, and said, "Father, to Thy hands I entrust my spirit." And after uttering these words He yielded up His spirit.
25983	42	23	47	 The Captain, seeing what had happened, gave glory to God, saying, "Beyond question this man was innocent."
25984	42	23	48	 And all the crowds that had come together to this sight, after seeing all that had occurred, returned to the city beating their breasts.
25985	42	23	49	 But all His acquaintances, and the women who had been His followers after leaving Galilee, continued standing at a distance and looking on.
25986	42	23	50	  There was a member of the Council of the name of Joseph, a kind-hearted and upright man,
25987	42	23	51	 who came from the Jewish town of Arimathaea and was awaiting the coming of the Kingdom of God. He had not concurred in the design or action of the Council,
25988	42	23	52	 and now he went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
25989	42	23	53	 Then, taking it down, he wrapped it in a  linen sheet and laid it in a tomb in the rock, where no one else had yet been put.
25990	42	23	54	 It was the Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was near at hand.
25991	42	23	55	 The women--those who had come with Jesus from Galilee--followed close behind, and saw the tomb and how His body was placed.
25992	42	23	56	 Then they returned, and prepared spices and perfumes. On the Sabbath they rested in obedience to the Commandment.
25993	42	24	1	  And, on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb bringing the spices they had prepared.
25994	42	24	2	 But they found the stone rolled back from the tomb,
25995	42	24	3	 and on entering they found that the body  of the Lord Jesus was not there.
25996	42	24	4	  At this they were in great perplexity, when  suddenly there stood by them two men whose raiment  flashed like lightning.
25997	42	24	5	 The women were terrified; but, as they stood with their faces bowed to the ground, the men said to them, "Why do you search among the dead for Him who is living?
25998	42	24	6	 He is not here. He has come back to life. Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee,
25999	42	24	7	 when He told you that the Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again."
26000	42	24	8	 Then they remembered His words,
26001	42	24	9	  and returning from the tomb they reported all this to the Eleven and to all the rest.
26002	42	24	10	 The women were Mary of  Magdala, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James; and they and the rest of the women related all this to the Apostles.
26003	42	24	11	 But the whole story seemed to them an idle tale; they could not believe the women.
26004	42	24	12	  Peter, however, rose and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw nothing but the  linen cloths: so he went away to his own home, wondering at what had happened.
26005	42	24	13	  On that same day two of the disciples were walking to Emmaus, a village seven or eight miles from Jerusalem,
26006	42	24	14	 and were conversing about all these recent events;
26007	42	24	15	 and, in the midst of their conversation and discussion, Jesus Himself came and joined them,
26008	42	24	16	 though they were prevented from recognizing Him.
26009	42	24	17	 "What is the subject," He asked them, "on which you are talking so earnestly, as you  walk?" And they stood still, looking full of sorrow.
26010	42	24	18	 Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered,  "Are you a stranger lodging alone in Jerusalem, that you have known nothing of the things that have lately happened in the city?"
26011	42	24	19	 "What things?" He asked. "The things about Jesus the Nazarene," they said, "who was a Prophet powerful in work and word before God and all the people;
26012	42	24	20	 and how our High Priests and Rulers delivered Him up to be sentenced to death, and crucified Him.
26013	42	24	21	 But we were hoping that it was He who was about to ransom Israel. Yes, and moreover it was  the day before yesterday that these things happened.
26014	42	24	22	 And, besides, some of the women of our company have amazed us. They went to the tomb at daybreak,
26015	42	24	23	 and, finding that His body was not there, they came and declared to us that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive.
26016	42	24	24	 Thereupon some of our party went to the tomb and found things just as the women had said; but Jesus Himself they did not see."
26017	42	24	25	 "O dull-witted men," He replied, "with  minds so slow to believe all that the Prophets have spoken!
26018	42	24	26	 Was there not a necessity for the Christ thus to suffer, and then enter into His glory?"
26019	42	24	27	 And,  beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He  explained to them the passages in Scripture which refer to Himself.
26020	42	24	28	 When they had come near the village to which they were going, He appeared to be going further.
26021	42	24	29	 But they pressed Him to remain with them. "Because," said they, "it is getting towards evening, and the day is nearly over." So He went in to stay with them.
26022	42	24	30	 But as soon as He had sat down with them, and had taken the  bread and had blessed and broken it, and was handing it to them,
26023	42	24	31	 their eyes were opened and they recognized Him. But He vanished from them.
26024	42	24	32	 "Were not our hearts," they said to one another, "burning within us while He talked to us on the way and explained the Scriptures to us?"
26025	42	24	33	 So they rose and without an hour's delay returned to Jerusalem, and found the Eleven and the rest met together, who said  to them,
26026	42	24	34	 "Yes, it is true: the Master has come back to life. He has been seen by Simon."
26027	42	24	35	 Then they related what had happened on the way, and how He had been recognized by them in the breaking of the  bread.
26028	42	24	36	  While they were thus talking, He Himself stood in their midst  and said, "Peace be to you!"
26029	42	24	37	 Startled, and in the utmost alarm, they thought they were looking at a spirit;
26030	42	24	38	 but He said to them, "Why such alarm? And why are there such questionings in your minds?
26031	42	24	39	 See my hands and my feet--it is my very self. Feel me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see I have."
26032	42	24	40	  And then He showed them His hands and His feet.
26033	42	24	41	 But, while they still could not believe it for joy and were full of astonishment, He asked them, "Have you any food here?"
26034	42	24	42	 And they gave Him a piece of roasted  fish,
26035	42	24	43	 and He took it and ate it in their presence.
26036	42	24	44	  And He said to them, "This is what I told you while I was still with you--that everything must be fulfilled that is written in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets and the Psalms concerning me."
26037	42	24	45	 Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,
26038	42	24	46	 and He said, "Thus it is written that the Christ would suffer and on the third day rise again from among the dead;
26039	42	24	47	 and that proclamation would be made, in His name, of repentance and forgiveness of sins to all the nations, beginning in Jerusalem.
26040	42	24	48	 You are witnesses as to these things.
26041	42	24	49	 And remember that I am about to send out my Father's promised gift to rest upon you. But, as for you,  wait patiently in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."
26042	42	24	50	 And He brought them out  to within view of Bethany, and then lifted up His hands and blessed them.
26043	42	24	51	 And while He was blessing them, He parted from them and was carried up into Heaven.
26044	42	24	52	 They worshipped Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.
26045	42	24	53	 Afterwards they were continually  in attendance at the Temple,  blessing God.
26046	43	1	1	  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
26047	43	1	2	 He was in the beginning with God.
26048	43	1	3	 All things came into being  through Him, and apart from Him nothing  that exists came into being.
26049	43	1	4	 In Him was Life, and that Life was the Light of men.
26050	43	1	5	 The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not  overpowered it.
26051	43	1	6	 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
26052	43	1	7	 He came as a witness, in order that he might give testimony concerning the Light--so that all might believe through him.
26053	43	1	8	 He was not the Light, but he  existed that he might give testimony concerning the Light.
26054	43	1	9	 The true Light was that which illumines  every man by its coming into the world.
26055	43	1	10	  He was in the world, and the world came into existence through Him, and the world did not recognize Him.
26056	43	1	11	 He came to the things that were His own, and His own people gave Him no welcome.
26057	43	1	12	 But all who have received Him, to them--that is, to those who trust in His name--He has given the privilege of becoming children of God;
26058	43	1	13	 who were begotten as such not  by  human descent, nor through an impulse  of their own nature, nor through the will of  a human father, but from God.
26059	43	1	14	 And the Word came in the flesh, and  lived for a time in our midst, so that we saw His glory--the glory as of the Father's  only Son, sent from His presence. He was full of grace and truth.
26060	43	1	15	 John gave testimony concerning Him and cried aloud, saying, "This is He of whom I said, `He who is coming after me has been put before me,' for He was before me."
26061	43	1	16	 For He it is from whose fulness we have all received, and grace upon grace.
26062	43	1	17	 For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
26063	43	1	18	 No human eye has ever seen God:  the only Son, who is  in the Father's bosom--He has made Him known.
26064	43	1	19	 This also is John's testimony, when the Jews sent to him a deputation of Priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who he was.
26065	43	1	20	 He avowed--he did not conceal the truth, but avowed, "I am not the Christ."
26066	43	1	21	 "What then?" they inquired; "are you Elijah?" "I am not," he said. "Are you the Prophet?" "No," he answered.
26067	43	1	22	 So they pressed the question. "Who are you?" they said--"that we may take an answer to those who sent us. What account do you give of yourself?"
26068	43	1	23	 "I am <the voice,"> he replied, <"of one crying aloud, `Make straight the Lord's way  in the Desert,'> fulfilling the words of the Prophet Isaiah."
26069	43	1	24	 They were Pharisees who had been sent.
26070	43	1	25	 Again they questioned him. "Why then do you baptize," they said, "if you are neither the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet?"
26071	43	1	26	 "I baptize in water only," John answered, "but in your midst stands One whom you do not know--
26072	43	1	27	 He who is to come after me, and whose sandal-strap I am not worthy to unfasten."
26073	43	1	28	 This conversation took place at Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
26074	43	1	29	 The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him and exclaimed,  "Look, that is the Lamb of God who is to take away the sin of the world!
26075	43	1	30	 This is He about whom I said, `After me is to come One who has been put before me, because He was before me.'
26076	43	1	31	 I did not yet know Him; but that He may be openly shown to Israel is the reason why I have come baptizing in water."
26077	43	1	32	 John also gave testimony by stating:  "I have seen the Spirit coming down like a dove out of Heaven; and it remained upon Him.
26078	43	1	33	 I did not yet know Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, "`The One on whom you see the Spirit coming down, and remaining, He it is who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.'
26079	43	1	34	 "This  I have seen, and I have become a witness that He is the Son of God."
26080	43	1	35	 Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,
26081	43	1	36	 when he saw Jesus passing by, and said, "Look! that is the Lamb of God!"
26082	43	1	37	 The two disciples heard his exclamation, and they followed Jesus.
26083	43	1	38	 Then Jesus turned round, and seeing them following He asked them, "What is your wish?"  "Rabbi," they replied--`Rabbi' means `Teacher' --"where are you staying?"
26084	43	1	39	 "Come and you shall see," He said. So they went and saw where He was staying, and they remained and spent that day with Him. It was then about  ten o'clock in the morning.
26085	43	1	40	 Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard John's exclamation and followed Jesus.
26086	43	1	41	 He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, "We have found the Messiah!" --that is to say,  the Anointed One.
26087	43	1	42	 He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon, son of John: you shall be called  Cephas" --that is to say, Peter (or `Rock').
26088	43	1	43	 The next day, having decided to leave Bethany and go into Galilee, Jesus found Philip, and invited him to follow Him.
26089	43	1	44	 (Now Philip came from Bethsaida,  the same town as Andrew and Peter.)
26090	43	1	45	 Then Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, "We have found him about whom Moses in the Law wrote, as well as the Prophets--Jesus, the son of Joseph, a man of Nazareth."
26091	43	1	46	 "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" replied Nathanael. "Come and see," said Philip.
26092	43	1	47	 Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, and said of him, "Look! here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no  deceitfulness!"
26093	43	1	48	 "How do you know me?" Nathanael asked. "Before Philip called you," said Jesus, "when you were under the fig-tree I saw you."
26094	43	1	49	 "Rabbi," cried Nathanael, "you are the Son of God, you are Israel's King!"
26095	43	1	50	 "Because I said to you, `I saw you under the fig-tree,'" replied Jesus, "do you believe? You shall see greater things than that."
26096	43	1	51	 "I tell you all  in most solemn truth," He added,  "that you shall see Heaven opened wide, and God's angels going up, and coming down to the Son of Man."
26097	43	2	1	  Two days later there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there,
26098	43	2	2	 and Jesus also was invited and His disciples.
26099	43	2	3	 Now the wine ran short; whereupon the mother of Jesus said to Him, "They have no wine."
26100	43	2	4	  "Leave the matter in my hands," He replied;  "the time for me to act has not yet come."
26101	43	2	5	 His mother said to the attendants, "Whatever he tells you to do,  do it."
26102	43	2	6	 Now there were six stone jars standing there (in accordance with the Jewish regulations for purification), each large enough to hold twenty gallons or more.
26103	43	2	7	 Jesus said to the attendants, "Fill the jars with water." And they filled them to the brim.
26104	43	2	8	 Then He said, "Now, take some out, and carry it to the President of the feast."
26105	43	2	9	 So they carried some to him. And no sooner had the President tasted the water now turned into wine, than--not knowing where it came from, though the attendants who had drawn the water knew--he called to the bridegroom
26106	43	2	10	 and said to him, "It is usual to put on the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then that which is inferior. But you have kept the good wine till now."
26107	43	2	11	 This, the first of His  miracles, Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee, and thus displayed His glorious power; and His disciples believed in Him.
26108	43	2	12	 Afterwards He went down to Capernaum--He, and His mother, and His brothers, and His disciples; and they made a short stay there.
26109	43	2	13	 But the Jewish Passover was approaching, and for this Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
26110	43	2	14	 And He found in the Temple the dealers in cattle and sheep and in pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there.
26111	43	2	15	 So He plaited a whip of  rushes, and drove all--both sheep and bullocks--out of the Temple. The small coin of the brokers He upset on the ground and overturned their tables.
26112	43	2	16	 And to the pigeon-dealers He said, "Take these things away. Do not turn my Father's house into a market."
26113	43	2	17	 This recalled to His disciples the words of Scripture, <"My zeal for Thy House will consume me.">
26114	43	2	18	 So the Jews  asked Him, "What  proof of your authority do you exhibit to us, seeing that you do these things?"
26115	43	2	19	 "Demolish this Sanctuary," said Jesus, "and in three days I will rebuild it."
26116	43	2	20	 "It has taken forty-six years," replied the Jews, "to build this Sanctuary, and will you rebuild it in three days?"
26117	43	2	21	 But He was speaking of the Sanctuary of His body.
26118	43	2	22	 When however He had risen from among the dead, His disciples recollected that He  had said this; and they believed the Scripture and the  teaching which Jesus had given them.
26119	43	2	23	 Now when He was in Jerusalem,  at the Festival of the Passover, many  became believers  in Him through watching the miracles He performed.
26120	43	2	24	 But for His part, Jesus did not trust Himself to them, because He knew them all,
26121	43	2	25	 and did not need any one's testimony concerning  a man, for He of Himself knew what was in the man.
26122	43	3	1	 Now there was one of the Pharisees whose name was Nicodemus--a ruler among the Jews.
26123	43	3	2	 He came to Jesus by night and said, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher from God; for no one can do these miracles which you are doing, unless God is with him.
26124	43	3	3	 "In most solemn truth I tell you," answered Jesus, "that unless a man is born  anew he cannot see the Kingdom of God."
26125	43	3	4	 "How is it possible," Nicodemus asked, "for a man to be born when he is old? Can he a second time enter his mother's womb and be born?"
26126	43	3	5	 "In most solemn truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "that unless a man is  born of water  and the Spirit, he cannot enter the Kingdom of God.
26127	43	3	6	  Whatever has been  born of the flesh is flesh, and whatever has been born of the Spirit is spirit.
26128	43	3	7	 Do not be astonished at my telling you, `You must all be born anew.'
26129	43	3	8	  The wind blows where it chooses, and you hear its  sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. So is it with every one who has been born of the Spirit."
26130	43	3	9	 "How is all this possible?" asked Nicodemus.
26131	43	3	10	 "Are you," replied Jesus, "`the  Teacher of Israel,' and yet do you not understand these things?
26132	43	3	11	 In most solemn truth I tell you that  we speak what we know, and give testimony of that of which we  were eye-witnesses, and yet you all reject our testimony.
26133	43	3	12	 If I have told you earthly things and none of you believe me, how will you believe me if I tell you of things in Heaven?
26134	43	3	13	  There is no one who has gone up to Heaven, but there is One who has come down from Heaven, namely the Son of Man whose home is in Heaven.
26135	43	3	14	 And just as Moses lifted high the serpent in the Desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
26136	43	3	15	 in order that every one who trusts in Him may have the  Life of the Ages."
26137	43	3	16	  For so  greatly did God love the world that He gave His  only Son, that every one who trusts in Him may not perish but may have the Life of Ages.
26138	43	3	17	 For God  did not send His Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.
26139	43	3	18	 He who trusts in Him does not come up for judgement. He who does not trust has already received sentence, because he  has not his trust resting on the name of God's only Son.
26140	43	3	19	 And this is the  test by which men  are judged--the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness more than they loved the Light, because their deeds were wicked.
26141	43	3	20	 For every wrongdoer hates the light, and does not come to the light, for fear his actions should be exposed and condemned.
26142	43	3	21	 But he who does  what is honest and right comes to the light, in order that his actions may be plainly shown to have been done  in God.
26143	43	3	22	 After this Jesus and His disciples went into Judaea; and there He made a stay in company with them and baptized.
26144	43	3	23	 And John too was baptizing at Aenon, near Salim, because there were many  pools of water there; and people came and received baptism.
26145	43	3	24	 (For John was not yet in prison.)
26146	43	3	25	 As the result, a discussion having arisen on the part of John's disciples with a Jew about purification,
26147	43	3	26	 they came to John and reported to him, "Rabbi, he who was with you on the other side of the Jordan and to whom you bore testimony is now baptizing, and  great numbers of people are resorting to him."
26148	43	3	27	 "A man cannot obtain anything," replied John, "unless it has been granted to him from Heaven.
26149	43	3	28	 You yourselves can bear witness to my having said, `I am not the Christ,' but  `I am His appointed forerunner.'
26150	43	3	29	 He who has the bride is the bridegroom; and the bridegroom's friend who stands by his side and listens to him, rejoices heartily on account of the bridegroom's happiness. Therefore this joy of mine is now complete.
26151	43	3	30	 He must grow greater, but I must grow less.
26152	43	3	31	 He who  comes from above is above all. He whose origin is from the earth is not only himself from the earth, his teaching also is from the earth. He who comes from Heaven  is above all.
26153	43	3	32	 What He  has seen and heard, to that He bears witness; but His testimony no one receives.
26154	43	3	33	 Any man who has received His testimony has  solemnly declared that God is true.
26155	43	3	34	  For He whom God has sent speaks God's words; for God does not give the Spirit  with limitations."
26156	43	3	35	  The Father loves the Son and has entrusted everything to His hands.
26157	43	3	36	 He who  believes in the Son has the Life of the Ages; he who  disobeys the Son will not  enter into Life, but God's anger remains upon him.
26158	43	4	1	 Now as soon as the Master was aware that the Pharisees had heard it said, "Jesus is gaining and baptizing more disciples than John"--
26159	43	4	2	 though Jesus Himself did not baptize them, but His disciples did--
26160	43	4	3	 He left Judaea and returned to Galilee.
26161	43	4	4	 His road lay through Samaria,
26162	43	4	5	 and so He came to Sychar, a town in Samaria near the piece of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
26163	43	4	6	 Jacob's  Well was there: and accordingly Jesus, tired out with His journey, sat down by the well to rest. It was about  six o'clock in the evening.
26164	43	4	7	 Presently there came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus asked her to give Him some water;
26165	43	4	8	 for His disciples were gone to the town to buy provisions.
26166	43	4	9	 "How is it," replied the woman, "that a Jew like you asks me, who am a woman and a Samaritan, for water?"  (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
26167	43	4	10	  "If you had known God's free gift," replied Jesus, "and who it is that said to you, `Give me some water,' you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water."
26168	43	4	11	 "Sir," she said, "you have nothing to draw with, and the  well is deep; so where can you get the living water from?
26169	43	4	12	 Are you greater than our forefather Jacob, who gave us the well, and himself drank from it, as did also his sons and his cattle?"
26170	43	4	13	 "Every one," replied Jesus, "who drinks any of this water will be thirsty again;
26171	43	4	14	 but whoever drinks any of the water that I shall give him will never, never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become a fountain within him of water  springing up  for  the Life of the Ages."
26172	43	4	15	 "Sir," said the woman, "give me that water, that I may never be thirsty, nor continually come all the way here to draw from the well."
26173	43	4	16	 "Go and call your husband," said Jesus; "and come back."
26174	43	4	17	 "I have no husband," she replied. "You rightly  say that you have no husband," said Jesus;
26175	43	4	18	 "for you have had five husbands, and the man you have at present is not your husband. You have spoken the truth in saying that."
26176	43	4	19	 "Sir," replied the woman, "I see that you are a Prophet.
26177	43	4	20	 Our forefathers worshipped on this mountain, but you Jews say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem."
26178	43	4	21	  "Believe me," said Jesus, "the time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
26179	43	4	22	 You worship  One of whom you know nothing. We worship One whom we know; for salvation comes from the Jews.
26180	43	4	23	 But a time is coming--nay, has already come--when the true worshippers will worship the Father  with true spiritual worship; for indeed the Father desires  such worshippers.
26181	43	4	24	 God is  Spirit; and those who worship Him must bring Him true spiritual worship."
26182	43	4	25	 "I know," replied the woman, "that Messiah is coming--`the  Christ,' as He is called. When He has come, He will tell us everything."
26183	43	4	26	 "I am He," said Jesus--"I who am now talking to you."
26184	43	4	27	 Just then His disciples came, and were surprised to find Him talking with a woman. Yet not one of them asked Him, "What is your wish?" or "Why are you talking with her?"
26185	43	4	28	 The woman however, leaving her  pitcher, went away to the town, and called the people.
26186	43	4	29	 "Come," she said, "and see a man who has told me everything I have ever done. Can this be the Christ, do you think?"
26187	43	4	30	 They left the town and  set out to go to Him.
26188	43	4	31	 Meanwhile the disciples were urging Jesus. "Rabbi," they said, "eat something."
26189	43	4	32	 "I have food to eat," He replied, "of which you do not know."
26190	43	4	33	 So the disciples began questioning one another. "Can it be," they said, "that some one has brought Him something to eat?"
26191	43	4	34	 "My food," said Jesus, "is to be obedient to Him who sent me, and fully to accomplish His work.
26192	43	4	35	 Do you not say, `It wants four months yet to the harvest'? But look round, I tell you, and observe these plains--  they are already ripe for the sickle.
26193	43	4	36	 The reaper gets pay and gathers in a crop in preparation  for the Life of the Ages, that so the sower and the reapers may rejoice together.
26194	43	4	37	 For it is  in this that you see the real meaning of the saying, `The sower is one person, and the reaper is another.'
26195	43	4	38	 I sent you to reap a harvest which is not the result of your own labours. Others have laboured, and you are getting benefit from their labours."
26196	43	4	39	 Of the Samaritan population of that town a good many believed in Him because of the woman's statement when she declared, "He has told me all that I have ever done."
26197	43	4	40	 When however the Samaritans came to Him, they  asked Him on all sides to stay with them; and He stayed there two days.
26198	43	4	41	 Then a far larger number of people believed because of His own words,
26199	43	4	42	 and they said to the woman, "We no longer believe in Him simply because of your statements; for we have now heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Saviour of the world."
26200	43	4	43	 After the two days He departed, and went into Galilee;
26201	43	4	44	  though Jesus Himself declared that a Prophet has no honour in his own country.
26202	43	4	45	 When  however He reached Galilee, the Galilaeans welcomed Him eagerly, having been eye-witnesses of all that He had done in Jerusalem at the Festival; for they also had been to the Festival.
26203	43	4	46	 So He came once more to Cana in Galilee, where He had made the water into wine. Now there was a certain officer of the King's court whose son was ill at Capernaum.
26204	43	4	47	 Having heard that Jesus had come from Judaea to Galilee, he came to Him and begged Him to go down and cure his son; for he was at the point of death.
26205	43	4	48	 "Unless you and others see miracles and marvels," said Jesus, "nothing will induce you to believe."
26206	43	4	49	 "Sir," pleaded the officer, "come down before my child dies."
26207	43	4	50	  "You may return home," replied Jesus; "your son has recovered." He believed the words of Jesus, and started back home;
26208	43	4	51	 and he was already on his way down when his servants met him and told him that his son was alive and well.
26209	43	4	52	 So he inquired of them at what hour he had shown improvement. "Yesterday,  about seven o'clock," they replied, "the fever left him."
26210	43	4	53	 Then the father recollected that that was the time at which Jesus had said to him, "Your son has recovered," and he and his whole household became believers.
26211	43	4	54	 This is  the second miracle that Jesus performed, after coming from Judaea into Galilee.
26212	43	5	1	 After this there was a Festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
26213	43	5	2	 Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, called in Hebrew `Bethesda.' It has five arcades.
26214	43	5	3	 In these there used to lie a great number of sick persons, and of people who were blind or lame or paralyzed.
26215	43	5	4	  []
26216	43	5	5	 And there was one man there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.
26217	43	5	6	 Jesus saw him lying there, and knowing that he had been a long time in that condition, He asked him, "Do you wish to have health and strength?"
26218	43	5	7	 "Sir," replied the sufferer, "I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is moved; but while I am coming some one else steps down before me."
26219	43	5	8	 "Rise," said Jesus, "take up your mat and walk."
26220	43	5	9	 Instantly the man was restored to perfect health, and he took up his mat and began to walk.
26221	43	5	10	 That day was a Sabbath. So the Jews said to the man who had been cured, "It is the Sabbath: you must not carry your mat."
26222	43	5	11	 "He who cured me," he replied, "said to me, `Take up your mat and walk.'"
26223	43	5	12	  "Who is it," they asked, "that said to you, `Take up your mat and walk'?"
26224	43	5	13	 But the man who had been cured did not know who it was; for Jesus had passed out unnoticed, there being a crowd in the place.
26225	43	5	14	 Afterwards Jesus found him in the Temple and said to him, "You are now restored to health. Do not sin any more, or a worse thing may befall you."
26226	43	5	15	 The man went and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had restored him to health;
26227	43	5	16	 and on this account the Jews began to persecute Jesus--because He did these things on the Sabbath.
26228	43	5	17	 His reply to their accusation was, "My Father  works unceasingly, and so do I."
26229	43	5	18	 On this account then the Jews were all the more eager to put Him to death--because He not only broke the Sabbath, but also spoke of God as being in a special sense His Father, thus putting Himself on a level with God.
26230	43	5	19	 "In most solemn truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "that the Son can do nothing of Himself--He can only do what He sees the Father doing; for whatever He does, that the Son does in like manner.
26231	43	5	20	 For the Father  loves the Son and reveals to Him all that He Himself is doing. And greater deeds than these will He reveal to Him, in order that you may wonder.
26232	43	5	21	 For just as the Father awakens the dead and gives them life, so the Son also gives life to whom He wills.
26233	43	5	22	 The Father indeed does not judge any one, but He has entrusted all judgement to the Son,
26234	43	5	23	 that all may honour the Son even as they honour the Father. The man who withholds honour from the Son withholds honour from the Father who sent Him.
26235	43	5	24	 "In most solemn truth I tell you that he who listens to my teaching and believes Him who sent me, has  the Life of the Ages, and does not come  under judgement, but has passed over out of death into Life.
26236	43	5	25	 "In most solemn truth I tell you that  a time is coming--nay, has already come--when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those  who hear it will live.
26237	43	5	26	 For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He has also given to the Son to have life in Himself.
26238	43	5	27	 And He has conferred on Him authority to act as Judge, because He is the Son of Man.
26239	43	5	28	 Wonder not at this. For a time is coming when all who are in the graves will hear His voice and will come forth--
26240	43	5	29	 they who have done what is right to the resurrection of Life, and they whose actions have been evil to the resurrection of judgement.
26241	43	5	30	 "I can of my own self do nothing. As  I am bidden, so I judge; and mine is a just judgement, because it is not my own will that guides me, but the will of Him who sent me.
26242	43	5	31	 "If I give testimony concerning myself, my testimony  cannot be accepted.
26243	43	5	32	 There is  Another who gives testimony concerning me, and I know that the testimony is true which He offers concerning me.
26244	43	5	33	  "You sent to John, and he  both was and still is a witness to the truth.
26245	43	5	34	 But the testimony on my behalf which I accept is not from man; though I say all this in order that you may be saved.
26246	43	5	35	 He was the lamp that burned and shone, and for a time you were willing to be gladdened by his light.
26247	43	5	36	 "But the testimony which I have is weightier than that of John; for the  work the Father  has assigned to me for me to bring it to completion--the very work which I am doing--affords testimony concerning me that the Father has sent me.
26248	43	5	37	 And the Father who sent me, *He* has given testimony concerning me. None of you have ever either heard His voice or seen what He is like.
26249	43	5	38	 Nor have you His word dwelling within you, for you refuse to believe Him whom *He* has sent.
26250	43	5	39	  "You search the Scriptures, because you suppose that in them  you will find the Life  of the Ages; and it is those Scriptures that yield testimony concerning me;
26251	43	5	40	 and yet you are unwilling to come to me that you may have Life.
26252	43	5	41	 "I do not accept glory from man,
26253	43	5	42	 but I know you well, and I know that in your hearts you do not really love God.
26254	43	5	43	 I have come  as my Father's representative, and you do not receive me. If some one else comes representing only himself, him you will receive.
26255	43	5	44	 How is it possible for you to believe, while you receive glory from one another and have no desire for the glory that comes from the only God?
26256	43	5	45	  "Do not suppose that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you, namely Moses, on whom your hope rests.
26257	43	5	46	 For if you believe Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote about me.
26258	43	5	47	 But if you disbelieve his writings, how are you to believe my words?"
26259	43	6	1	  After this Jesus went away across the Lake of Galilee (that is, the Lake of Tiberias).
26260	43	6	2	 A vast multitude followed Him, because they witnessed the miracles on the sick which He was constantly performing.
26261	43	6	3	 Then Jesus went up the hill, and sat there with His disciples.
26262	43	6	4	 The Jewish Festival, the Passover, was at hand.
26263	43	6	5	 And when He looked round and saw an immense crowd coming towards Him, He said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread for all these people to eat?"
26264	43	6	6	 He said this to put Philip to the test, for He Himself knew what He was going to do.
26265	43	6	7	 "Seven pounds' worth of bread," replied Philip, "is not enough for them all to get even a scanty meal."
26266	43	6	8	 One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to Him,
26267	43	6	9	 "There is a boy here with five barley  loaves and a couple of fish: but what is that among so many?"
26268	43	6	10	 "Make the people sit down," said Jesus. The ground was covered with thick grass; so they sat down, the adult men numbering about 5,000.
26269	43	6	11	 Then Jesus took the loaves, and after giving thanks He distributed them to those who were resting on the ground; and also the fish in like manner--as much as they desired.
26270	43	6	12	 When all were fully satisfied, He said to His disciples, "Gather up the broken portions that remain over, so that nothing be lost."
26271	43	6	13	 Accordingly they gathered them up; and with the fragments of the five barley loaves--the broken portions that remained over after they had done eating--they filled twelve baskets.
26272	43	6	14	 Thereupon the people, having seen the miracle He had performed, said, "This is indeed the Prophet who was to come into the world."
26273	43	6	15	  Perceiving,  however, that they were about to come and carry Him off by force to make Him a king, Jesus withdrew again up the hill alone by Himself.
26274	43	6	16	 When evening came on, His disciples went down to the Lake.
26275	43	6	17	 There they got on board a boat, and pushed off to cross the Lake to Capernaum. By this time it had become dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them.
26276	43	6	18	 The Lake also was getting rough, because a strong wind was blowing.
26277	43	6	19	 When, however, they had rowed three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the water and coming near the boat.
26278	43	6	20	 They were terrified; but He called to them. "It is I," He said, "do not be afraid."
26279	43	6	21	 Then they were willing to take Him on board; and in a moment the boat reached the shore at the point to which they were going.
26280	43	6	22	 Next morning the crowd who were still standing about on the other side of the Lake found that there had been but one small boat there, and they had seen that Jesus did not go on board with His disciples, but that His disciples went away without Him.
26281	43	6	23	 Yet a number of small boats came from Tiberias to the neighbourhood of the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
26282	43	6	24	 When however the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, they themselves also took boats and came to Capernaum to look for Jesus.
26283	43	6	25	 So when they had crossed the Lake and had found Him, they asked Him, "Rabbi, when did you come here?"
26284	43	6	26	  "In most solemn truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "that you are searching for me not because you have seen miracles, but because you ate  the loaves and had a hearty meal.
26285	43	6	27	 Bestow your pains not on the food which perishes, but on the food that remains unto  the Life of the Ages--that food which will be the Son of Man's gift to you; for on Him the Father, God, has set His seal."
26286	43	6	28	 "What are we to do," they asked, "in order to carry out the things that God requires?"
26287	43	6	29	 "This," replied Jesus, "is above all the thing that God requires--that you should be believers in Him whom He has sent."
26288	43	6	30	  "What miracle then," they asked, "do you perform for us to see and become believers in you? What do you *do*?
26289	43	6	31	 Our forefathers ate the manna in the Desert, as it is written, <`He gave them bread out of Heaven to eat'.">
26290	43	6	32	 "In most solemn truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "that Moses did not give you the bread out of Heaven, but my Father is giving you the bread--the true bread--out of Heaven.
26291	43	6	33	 For God's bread is  that which comes down out of Heaven and gives Life to the world."
26292	43	6	34	 "Sir," they said, "always give us that bread."
26293	43	6	35	 "I am the bread of Life," replied Jesus; "he who comes to me shall never hunger, and he who believes in me shall never, never thirst.
26294	43	6	36	 But  it is as I have said to you: you have seen  me and yet you do not believe.
26295	43	6	37	  Every one whom the Father gives me will come to me, and him who comes to me I will never on any account drive away.
26296	43	6	38	 For I have left Heaven and have come down to earth not to seek my own  pleasure, but to do the will of Him who sent me.
26297	43	6	39	 And this is the will of Him who sent me, that of  all that He has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise  it to life on the last day.
26298	43	6	40	 For this is my Father's will, that every one who fixes his gaze on the Son of God and believes in Him should have the Life  of the Ages, and I will raise him to life on the last day."
26299	43	6	41	 Now the Jews began to find fault about Him because of His claiming to be the bread which came down out of Heaven.
26300	43	6	42	 They kept asking, "Is not  this man Joseph's son? Is he not Jesus, whose father and mother we know? What does he mean by now saying, `I have come down out of Heaven'?"
26301	43	6	43	 "Do not  thus find fault among yourselves," replied Jesus;
26302	43	6	44	 "no one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; then I will raise him to life on the last day.
26303	43	6	45	 It stands written in the Prophets, <`And they shall all of them be taught by God'.> Every one who  listens to the Father and learns from Him comes to me.
26304	43	6	46	 No one has ever seen the Father--except Him who is from God. He has seen the Father.
26305	43	6	47	 "In most solemn truth I tell you that he who  believes has the Life of the Ages.
26306	43	6	48	 I am the bread of Life.
26307	43	6	49	 Your forefathers ate the manna in the Desert, and they died.
26308	43	6	50	 Here is the bread that comes down out of Heaven that a man may eat it and not die.
26309	43	6	51	 I am the living bread come down out of Heaven. If a man eats  this bread, he shall live for ever. Moreover the bread which I will give is my flesh  given for the life of the world."
26310	43	6	52	 This led to an angry debate among the Jews. "How can  this man," they argued, "give us his flesh to eat?"
26311	43	6	53	 "In most solemn truth I tell you," said Jesus, "that unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no Life  in you.
26312	43	6	54	 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has the Life of the Ages, and I will raise him up on the last day.
26313	43	6	55	 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.
26314	43	6	56	 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in union with me, and I remain in union with him.
26315	43	6	57	 As the ever-living Father has sent me, and I live  because of the Father, so also he who eats me will live because of me.
26316	43	6	58	 This is the bread which came down out of Heaven; it is unlike that which your forefathers ate--for they ate and yet died. He who eats this bread shall live for ever."
26317	43	6	59	 Jesus said all this  in the synagogue while teaching at Capernaum.
26318	43	6	60	 Many therefore of His disciples, when they heard it, said, "This is hard to accept. Who can listen  to such teaching?"
26319	43	6	61	 But, knowing in Himself that His disciples were dissatisfied about it, Jesus asked them,
26320	43	6	62	  "Does this seem incredible to you? What then if you were to see the Son of Man ascending  again where He was before?
26321	43	6	63	 It is the spirit which gives Life. The flesh confers no benefit whatever. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and are Life.
26322	43	6	64	 But there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were that did not believe, and who it was that would betray Him.
26323	43	6	65	 So He added, "That is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it be granted him by the Father."
26324	43	6	66	 Thereupon many of His disciples left Him and went away, and no longer associated with Him.
26325	43	6	67	 Jesus therefore appealed to the Twelve. "Will you go also?" He asked.
26326	43	6	68	 "Master," replied Simon Peter, "to whom shall we go?  Your teachings tell us of the Life of the Ages.
26327	43	6	69	 And we have come to believe and know that *you* are indeed the Holy One of God."
26328	43	6	70	 "Did not I choose you--the Twelve?" said Jesus, "and even of you one is  a devil."
26329	43	6	71	 He alluded to Judas, the son of Simon the Iscariot. For he it was who, though one of the Twelve, was afterwards to betray Him.
26330	43	7	1	  After this Jesus moved from place to place in Galilee. He would not go about in Judaea, because the Jews were seeking an opportunity to kill Him.
26331	43	7	2	 But the Jewish Festival of the Tent-Pitching was approaching.
26332	43	7	3	 So His brothers said to Him, "Leave these parts and go into Judaea, that not only we but your disciples also may witness the miracles which you perform.
26333	43	7	4	 For no one acts in secret, desiring all the while to be himself known publicly. Since you are doing these things, show yourself openly to the world."
26334	43	7	5	 For even His brothers were not believers in Him.
26335	43	7	6	 "My time," replied Jesus, "has not yet come, but for you any time is suitable.
26336	43	7	7	 It is impossible for the world to hate you; but me it does hate, because I give testimony concerning it that its conduct is evil.
26337	43	7	8	 As for you, go up to the Festival.  I do  not now go up to this Festival, because my time is not yet fully come."
26338	43	7	9	 Such was His answer, and He remained in Galilee.
26339	43	7	10	 When however His brothers had gone up to the Festival, then He also went up, not openly, but as it were privately.
26340	43	7	11	 Meanwhile the Jews at the Festival were looking for Him and were inquiring, "Where is he?"
26341	43	7	12	 Among the mass of the people there was much muttered debate about Him. Some said, "He is a good man." Others said, "Not so: he is imposing on the people."
26342	43	7	13	 Yet  for fear of the Jews no one spoke out boldly about Him.
26343	43	7	14	 But when the Festival was already half over, Jesus went up to the Temple and commenced teaching.
26344	43	7	15	 The Jews were astonished. "How does  this man know anything of books," they said, "although he has never been at any of the schools?"
26345	43	7	16	 Jesus answered their question by saying, "My teaching does not belong to me, but comes from Him who sent me.
26346	43	7	17	 If any one is willing to do His will, he shall know about the teaching, whether it is from God or originates with me.
26347	43	7	18	 The man whose teaching originates with himself aims at his own glory. He who aims at the glory of Him who sent him teaches the truth, and there is no deception in him.
26348	43	7	19	 Did not Moses give you the Law? And yet not a man of you obeys the Law. Why do you want to kill me?"
26349	43	7	20	 "You are possessed by a demon," replied the crowd;  "no one wants to kill you."
26350	43	7	21	 "One deed I have done," replied Jesus, "and you are all full of wonder.
26351	43	7	22	 Consider therefore. Moses  gave you the rite of circumcision (not that it began with Moses, but with your earlier forefathers), and even on a Sabbath day you circumcise a child.
26352	43	7	23	 If a child is circumcised even on a Sabbath day, are you bitter against me because I have restored a man to perfect health on a Sabbath day?
26353	43	7	24	  Do not form  superficial judgements, but form the judgements that are just."
26354	43	7	25	 Some however of the people of Jerusalem said, "Is not this the man they are wanting to kill?
26355	43	7	26	 But  here he is, speaking openly and boldly, and they say nothing to him! Can the Rulers really have ascertained that this man is the Christ?
26356	43	7	27	 And yet we know this man, and we know where he is from; but as for the Christ, when He comes, no one can tell where He is from."
26357	43	7	28	 Jesus therefore, while teaching in the Temple, cried aloud, and said, "Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from. And yet I have not come of my own accord; but there is One who has sent me, an Authority indeed, of whom you have no knowledge.
26358	43	7	29	 I know Him, because I came from Him, and He sent me."
26359	43	7	30	 On hearing this they wanted to arrest Him; yet not a hand was laid on Him, because His time had not yet come.
26360	43	7	31	 But from among the crowd a large number believed in Him. "When the Christ comes," they said, "will He perform more miracles than this teacher has performed?"
26361	43	7	32	 The Pharisees heard the people thus expressing their various doubts about Him, and the High Priests and the Pharisees sent some officers to apprehend Him.
26362	43	7	33	 So Jesus said, "Still for a short time I am with you, and then I go my way to Him who sent me.
26363	43	7	34	 You will look for me and will not find me, and where I am you cannot come."
26364	43	7	35	 The Jews therefore said to one another, "Where is he about to betake himself,  so that we shall not find him? Will he betake himself to the Dispersion among the  Gentiles, and teach the  Gentiles?
26365	43	7	36	 What do those words of his mean, `You will look for me, but will not find me, and where I am you cannot come'?"
26366	43	7	37	 On the last day of the Festival--the great day--Jesus stood up and cried aloud. "Whoever is thirsty," He said, "let him come to me and drink.
26367	43	7	38	 He who believes in me, from within him--as the Scripture has said--rivers of living water shall flow."
26368	43	7	39	 He referred to the Spirit which those who  believed in Him  were to receive; for the Spirit was not  bestowed as yet, because Jesus had not yet been  glorified.
26369	43	7	40	 After listening to these  discourses,  some of the crowd began to say, "This is beyond doubt the Prophet."
26370	43	7	41	 Others said, "He is the Christ." But others again,  "Not so, for is the Christ to come from Galilee?
26371	43	7	42	 Has not the Scripture declared that the Christ is to come of the family of David and from Bethlehem, David's village?"
26372	43	7	43	 So there was a violent dissension among the people on His account.
26373	43	7	44	 Some of them wanted at once to arrest Him, but no one laid hands upon Him.
26374	43	7	45	 Meanwhile the officers returned to the High Priests and Pharisees, who asked them, "Why have you not brought him?"
26375	43	7	46	 "No mere man has ever spoken as this man speaks," said the officers.
26376	43	7	47	 "Are *you* deluded too?" replied the Pharisees;
26377	43	7	48	 "has any one of the Rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?
26378	43	7	49	 But this rabble who understand nothing about the Law are accursed!"
26379	43	7	50	 Nicodemus interposed--he who had formerly gone to Jesus, being himself one of them.
26380	43	7	51	 "Does our Law," he asked, "judge a man without first hearing what he has to say and ascertaining what his conduct is?"
26381	43	7	52	 "Do you also come from Galilee?" they asked in reply. "Search and see for yourself that no Prophet is of Galilaean origin."
26382	43	7	53	  [So they went away to their several homes;
26383	43	8	1	 but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
26384	43	8	2	 At break of day however He returned to the Temple, and there the people came to Him in crowds. He seated Himself;
26385	43	8	3	 and was teaching them when the Scribes and the Pharisees brought to Him a woman who had been found committing adultery. They made her stand in the centre of the court, and they put the case to Him.
26386	43	8	4	  "Rabbi," they said, "this woman has been found in the very act of committing adultery.
26387	43	8	5	 Now, in the Law, Moses has ordered us to stone  such women to death. But what do you say?"
26388	43	8	6	 They asked this in order to put Him to the test, so that they might have some charge to bring against Him. But Jesus  leant forward and began to write with His finger on the ground.
26389	43	8	7	 When however they persisted with their question, He raised His head and said to them, "Let the sinless man among you be the first to throw a stone at her."
26390	43	8	8	 Then He leant forward again, and again began to write on the ground.
26391	43	8	9	 They listened to Him, and then, beginning with the eldest, took their departure, one by one, till all were gone. And Jesus was left behind alone--and the woman in the centre of the court.
26392	43	8	10	 Then, raising His head, Jesus said to her,  "Where are they? Has no one condemned you?"
26393	43	8	11	 "No one, Sir," she replied. "And *I* do not condemn you either," said Jesus; "go, and from this time do not sin any more."]
26394	43	8	12	 Once more Jesus addressed them. "I am the Light of the world," He said; "the man who follows me shall certainly not walk in the dark, but shall have the light of Life."
26395	43	8	13	 "You are giving testimony about yourself," said the Pharisees; "your testimony is not true."
26396	43	8	14	 "Even if I am giving testimony about myself," replied Jesus, "my testimony is true; for I know where I came from and where I am going, but you know neither of these two things.
26397	43	8	15	 You judge according to  appearances:  I am judging no one.
26398	43	8	16	 And even if I do judge, my judgement is  just; for I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me.
26399	43	8	17	 In your own Law, too, it is written that <the testimony of two men is true.>
26400	43	8	18	 I am one giving testimony about myself, and the Father who sent me gives testimony about me."
26401	43	8	19	 "Where is your Father?" they asked. "You know my Father as little as you know me." He replied; "if you knew me, you would know my Father also."
26402	43	8	20	 These sayings He uttered in the Treasury, while teaching in the  Temple; yet no one arrested Him, because His time had not yet come.
26403	43	8	21	 Again He said to them, "I am going away. Then you will try to find me, but you will die in your sins. Where I am going, it is impossible for you to come."
26404	43	8	22	 The Jews began to ask one another, "Is he going to kill himself, do you think, that he says, `Where I am going, it is impossible for you to come'?"
26405	43	8	23	 "You," He continued, "are from below, I am from above: you are of this present world, I am not of this present world.
26406	43	8	24	 That is why I told you that you will die in your sins; for, unless you believe that  I am He,  that is what will happen."
26407	43	8	25	 "You--who are you?" they  asked.  "How is it that I am speaking to you at all?" replied Jesus.
26408	43	8	26	 "Many things I have to speak and to judge concerning you. But He who sent me is true, and the things which I have heard from Him are those which  I have come into the world to speak."
26409	43	8	27	 They did not perceive that He was speaking to them of the Father.
26410	43	8	28	 So Jesus added, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that  I am He. Of myself I do nothing; but as the Father has taught me, so I speak.
26411	43	8	29	 And He who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone: for I do always what is pleasing to Him."
26412	43	8	30	 As He thus spoke, many became believers in Him.
26413	43	8	31	 Jesus therefore  said to those of the Jews who had now believed in Him, "As for you, if you  hold fast to my teaching, then you are truly my disciples;
26414	43	8	32	 and you shall know the Truth, and the Truth will make you free."
26415	43	8	33	 "We are descendants of Abraham," they answered, "and have never at any time been in slavery to any one. What do those words of yours mean, `You shall become free'?"
26416	43	8	34	 "In most solemn truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "that every one who commits sin is the slave of sin.
26417	43	8	35	 Now a slave does not remain permanently in his master's house, but a son does.
26418	43	8	36	 If then the Son shall make you free, you will be free indeed.
26419	43	8	37	 You are descendants of Abraham, I know; but you want to kill me, because my teaching gains no ground within you.
26420	43	8	38	 The words I speak are those I have  learnt in the presence of the Father. Therefore you also should do what you have heard from your father."
26421	43	8	39	 "Our father is Abraham," they said. "If you were Abraham's children," replied Jesus,  "it is Abraham's deeds that you would be doing.
26422	43	8	40	 But, in fact, you are longing to kill me, a man who has spoken to you the truth which I have heard from God. Abraham did not do that.
26423	43	8	41	 You are doing the deeds of your father." "We," they replied, "are not illegitimate children. We have one Father, namely God."
26424	43	8	42	 "If God were your Father," said Jesus, "you would love me; for it is from God that I came and I am now here. I have not come of myself, but *He* sent me.
26425	43	8	43	 How is it you do not understand me when I speak? It is because you cannot bear to listen to my words.
26426	43	8	44	 The father whose sons you are is the Devil; and you desire to do what gives him pleasure. *He* was a murderer from the beginning, and  does not stand firm  in the truth--for there is no truth in him. Whenever he utters his lie, he utters it  out of his own store; for he is a liar, and the father  of lies.
26427	43	8	45	 But because I  speak the truth, you do not believe me.
26428	43	8	46	  Which of *you* convicts me of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe me?
26429	43	8	47	 He who is a child of God listens to God's words. You do not listen to them: and why? It is because you are not God's children."
26430	43	8	48	 "Are we not right," answered the Jews, "in saying that you are a Samaritan and are possessed by a demon?"
26431	43	8	49	 "I am not possessed by a demon," replied Jesus. "On the contrary I honour my Father, and you dishonour me.
26432	43	8	50	 I, however, am not aiming at glory for myself: there is One who aims at glory for me--and who judges.
26433	43	8	51	 In most solemn truth I tell you that if any one shall have obeyed my  teaching he shall in no case ever see death."
26434	43	8	52	 "Now," exclaimed the Jews, "we know that you are possessed by a demon. Abraham died, and so did the Prophets, and yet *you* say, `If any one shall have obeyed my teaching, he shall in no case ever  taste death.'
26435	43	8	53	 Are you really greater than our forefather Abraham? For he died. And the prophets died.  Who do you make yourself out to be?"
26436	43	8	54	 "Were I to glorify myself," answered Jesus, "I should have no real glory. There is One who glorifies me--namely my Father, who you say is your God.
26437	43	8	55	 You do not know Him, but I know Him perfectly; and were I to deny my knowledge of Him, I should resemble you, and be a liar. On the contrary I do know Him, and I obey His  commands.
26438	43	8	56	 Abraham your forefather exulted  in the hope of seeing  my day: and he saw it, and was glad."
26439	43	8	57	 "You are not yet fifty years old," cried the Jews, "and have you seen Abraham?"
26440	43	8	58	 "In most solemn truth," answered Jesus, "I tell you that before Abraham came into existence, I am."
26441	43	8	59	 Thereupon they took up stones with which to stone Him, but He hid Himself and went away out of the Temple.
26442	43	9	1	  As He passed by, He saw a man who had been blind from his birth.
26443	43	9	2	 So His disciples asked Him, "Rabbi, who sinned--this man or his parents--that he was born blind?"
26444	43	9	3	 "Neither he nor his parents sinned," answered Jesus, "but he was born blind in order that  God's mercy might be openly shown in him.
26445	43	9	4	  We must do the works of Him who sent me while there is daylight. Night is coming on, when no one can work.
26446	43	9	5	 When I am in the world, I am  the Light of the world."
26447	43	9	6	 After thus speaking, He spat on the ground, and then, kneading the dust and spittle into clay, He smeared the clay over the man's eyes and said to him,
26448	43	9	7	 "Go and wash in the pool of Siloam" --the name means `Sent.' So he went and washed his eyes, and  returned able to see.
26449	43	9	8	 His neighbours, therefore, and the other people to whom he had been a familiar object because he was a beggar, began asking, "Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?"
26450	43	9	9	 "Yes it is," replied some of them. "No it is not," said others, "but he is like him." His own statement was, "I am the man."
26451	43	9	10	 "How then were your eyes opened?" they  asked.
26452	43	9	11	 "He whose name is Jesus," he answered, "made clay and smeared my eyes with it, and then told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed and  obtained sight."
26453	43	9	12	 "Where is he?" they inquired, but the man did not know.
26454	43	9	13	 They brought him to the Pharisees--the man who had been blind.
26455	43	9	14	 Now the day on which Jesus made the clay and opened the man's eyes was the Sabbath.
26456	43	9	15	 So the Pharisees renewed their questioning as to how he had obtained his sight. "He put clay on my eyes," he replied, "and I washed, and now I can see."
26457	43	9	16	 This led some of the Pharisees to say,  "That man has not come from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath." "How is it possible for  a bad man to do such miracles?" argued others.
26458	43	9	17	 And there was a division among them. So again they asked the once blind man, "What is your account of him? --for he opened your eyes." "He is a Prophet," he replied.
26459	43	9	18	 The Jews,  however, did not believe the statement concerning him--that he had been blind and had obtained his sight--until they called his parents and asked them,
26460	43	9	19	 "Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How is it then that he can now see?"
26461	43	9	20	 "We know," replied the parents, "that this is our son and that he was born blind;
26462	43	9	21	 but how it is that he can now see or who has opened his eyes we do not know. Ask him himself; he is of full age; he himself will give his own account of it."
26463	43	9	22	 Such was their answer, because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already settled among themselves that if any one should acknowledge Jesus as the Christ, he should be excluded from the synagogue.
26464	43	9	23	 That was why his parents said, "He is of full age: ask him himself."
26465	43	9	24	 A second time therefore they called the man who had been blind, and said, "Give God the praise: we know that that man is a sinner."
26466	43	9	25	 "Whether he is a sinner or not, I do not know," he replied; "one thing I know--that I was once blind and that now I can see."
26467	43	9	26	 "What did he do to you?" they asked; "how did he open your eyes?"
26468	43	9	27	 "I have told you already," he replied, "and you did not listen to me. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also mean to be disciples of his?"
26469	43	9	28	 Then they railed at him, and said, "You are that man's disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.
26470	43	9	29	 We know that God  spoke to Moses; but as for this fellow we do not know where he comes from."
26471	43	9	30	 "Why, this is marvellous!" the man replied; "you do not know where he comes from, and yet he has opened my eyes!
26472	43	9	31	 We know that God does not listen to bad people, but that if any one is a God-fearing man and obeys Him, to him He listens.
26473	43	9	32	  From the beginning of the world such a thing was never heard of as that any one should open the eyes of a man blind from his birth.
26474	43	9	33	 Had that man not come from God, he could have done nothing."
26475	43	9	34	 "You," they replied, "were wholly begotten and born in sin, and do *you* teach *us*?" And they put him out of the synagogue.
26476	43	9	35	 Jesus heard that they had done this. So having found him, He asked him, "Do you believe in the  Son of God?"
26477	43	9	36	 "Who is He, Sir?" replied the man. "Tell me, so that I may believe in Him."
26478	43	9	37	 "You have seen Him," said Jesus; "and not only so: He is now speaking to you."
26479	43	9	38	 "I believe, Sir," he said. And he threw himself at His feet.
26480	43	9	39	 "I came into this world," said Jesus, "to judge men, that those who do not see may see, and that those who do see may become blind."
26481	43	9	40	 These words were heard by those of the Pharisees who were present, and they asked Him, "Are *we* also blind?"
26482	43	9	41	  "If you were blind," answered Jesus, "you would have no sin; but as a matter of fact you boast that you see. So your sin remains!"
26483	43	10	1	 "In most solemn truth I tell you that the man who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs over some other way, is a thief and a robber.
26484	43	10	2	 But he who enters by the door is  the shepherd of the sheep.
26485	43	10	3	 To him the porter opens the door, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by their names and leads them out.
26486	43	10	4	 When he has brought out his own sheep--all of them--he walks at the head of them; and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.
26487	43	10	5	 But a stranger they will by no means follow, but will run away from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers."
26488	43	10	6	 Jesus spoke to them  in this figurative language, but they did not understand what He meant.
26489	43	10	7	 Again therefore Jesus said to them, "In most solemn truth I tell you that I am the Door  of the sheep.
26490	43	10	8	 All who  have come before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep would not listen to them.
26491	43	10	9	 I am the Door. If any one enters by me, he will find safety, and will go in and out and find pasture.
26492	43	10	10	 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy: I have come that they may have Life, and may have it in abundance.
26493	43	10	11	 "I am the Good Shepherd. A  good shepherd lays down his very  life for the sheep.
26494	43	10	12	 The hired servant--one who is not a shepherd and does not own the sheep--no sooner sees the wolf coming than he leaves the sheep and runs away; and the wolf worries and scatters them.
26495	43	10	13	 For he is only a hired servant and cares nothing for the sheep.
26496	43	10	14	 "I am the Good Shepherd. And I know my sheep and my sheep know me,
26497	43	10	15	 just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I am laying down my life for the sheep.
26498	43	10	16	 I have also other sheep--which do not belong to this fold. Those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice; and they shall become one flock under one Shepherd.
26499	43	10	17	 For this reason my Father loves me, because I am laying down my life in order to receive it back again.
26500	43	10	18	  No one is taking it away from me, but I myself am laying it down. I am authorized to lay it down, and I am authorized to receive it back again. This is the command I received from my Father."
26501	43	10	19	 Again there arose a division among the Jews because of these words.
26502	43	10	20	 Many of them said, "He is possessed by a demon and is mad. Why do you listen to him?"
26503	43	10	21	 Others argued, "That is not the language of a demoniac: and can a demon open blind men's eyes?"
26504	43	10	22	 The Dedication Festival  came on in Jerusalem. It was winter,
26505	43	10	23	 and Jesus was walking in the Temple in Solomon's Portico,
26506	43	10	24	 when the Jews gathered round Him and  kept asking Him, "How long do you mean to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us so plainly."
26507	43	10	25	 "I have told you," answered Jesus, "and you do not believe. The deeds that I do in my Father's name--they give testimony about me.
26508	43	10	26	 But you do not believe, because you are not my sheep.
26509	43	10	27	 My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
26510	43	10	28	 I give them the Life  of the Ages, and they shall never, never perish, nor shall any one wrest them from my hand.
26511	43	10	29	 What my Father has given me is  more precious than all besides; and no one is able to wrest anything from my Father's hand.
26512	43	10	30	 I and the Father  are one."
26513	43	10	31	 Again the Jews brought stones with which to stone Him.
26514	43	10	32	 Jesus remonstrated with them. "Many good deeds," He said, "have I shown you as coming from the Father; for  which of them are you going to stone me?"
26515	43	10	33	 "For no good deed," the Jews replied, "are we going to stone you, but for blasphemy, and because you, who are only a man, are making yourself out to be God."
26516	43	10	34	 "Does it not stand written in your Law," replied Jesus, <"`I said, you are gods'?>
26517	43	10	35	 If those to whom God's word was addressed  are called gods (and the Scripture cannot be annulled),
26518	43	10	36	 how is it that you say to one whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, `You are blaspheming,' because I said, `I am God's Son'?
26519	43	10	37	 If the deeds I do are not my Father's deeds, do not believe me.
26520	43	10	38	 But if they are, then even if you do not believe me, at least believe the deeds, that you may know and see clearly that the Father is in me, and that I am in the Father."
26521	43	10	39	 This made them once more try to arrest Him, but He withdrew out of their  power.
26522	43	10	40	 Then He went away again to the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John had been baptizing at first; and there He stayed.
26523	43	10	41	 Large numbers of people also came to Him. Their report was, "John did not work any miracle, but all that John said about this Teacher was true."
26524	43	10	42	 And many  became believers in Him there.
26525	43	11	1	 Now a certain man, named Lazarus, of Bethany, was lying ill--  Bethany being the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
26526	43	11	2	 (It was the Mary who poured the perfume over the Lord and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill.)
26527	43	11	3	 So the sisters sent to Him to say, "Master, he  whom you hold dear is ill."
26528	43	11	4	 Jesus received the message and said, "This illness is not to end in death, but is to promote the glory of God, in order that the Son of God may be glorified by it."
26529	43	11	5	 Now Jesus  loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
26530	43	11	6	 When, however, He heard that Lazarus was ill, He still remained two days in that same place.
26531	43	11	7	 Then, after that, He said to the disciples, "Let us return to Judaea."
26532	43	11	8	 "Rabbi," exclaimed the disciples, "the Jews have just been trying to stone you, and do you think of going back there again?"
26533	43	11	9	 "Are there not twelve hours in the day?" replied Jesus. "If any one walks in the daytime, he does not stumble--because he sees  the light of this world.
26534	43	11	10	 But if a man walks by night, he does stumble, because the light is not in him."
26535	43	11	11	 He said this, and afterwards He added, "Our  friend Lazarus  is sleeping, but I will go  and wake him."
26536	43	11	12	 "Master," said the disciples, "if he is asleep he will recover."
26537	43	11	13	 Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought He referred to the rest taken in ordinary sleep.
26538	43	11	14	 So then He told them plainly,
26539	43	11	15	 "Lazarus  is dead; and for your sakes I am glad I was not there, in order that you may believe. But let us go to him."
26540	43	11	16	 "Let us go also," Thomas, the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, "that we may die with him."
26541	43	11	17	  On His arrival Jesus found that Lazarus had already been  three days in the tomb.
26542	43	11	18	 Bethany was near Jerusalem, the distance being a little less than two miles;
26543	43	11	19	 and a considerable number of the Jews were with Martha and Mary, having come to express sympathy with them on the death of their brother.
26544	43	11	20	 Martha,  however, as soon as she heard the tidings, "Jesus is coming," went to meet Him; but Mary remained sitting in the house.
26545	43	11	21	 So Martha came and spoke to Jesus. "Master, if you had been here," she said, "my brother would not have died.
26546	43	11	22	 And  even now I know that whatever you ask God for, God will give you."
26547	43	11	23	 "Your brother  shall rise again," replied Jesus.
26548	43	11	24	 "I know," said Martha, "that he will rise again at the resurrection, on the last day."
26549	43	11	25	 "I am the Resurrection and the Life," said Jesus; "he who believes in me, even if he  has died, he shall live;
26550	43	11	26	 and every one who is living and is a believer in me shall never, never die. Do you believe this?"
26551	43	11	27	 "Yes, Master," she replied; "I thoroughly believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world."
26552	43	11	28	 After saying this, she went and called her sister Mary privately, telling her, "The  Rabbi is here and is asking for you."
26553	43	11	29	 So she, on hearing that, rose up quickly to go to Him.
26554	43	11	30	 Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met Him.
26555	43	11	31	 So the Jews who were with Mary in the house sympathizing with her, when they saw that she had risen hastily and had gone out, followed her,  supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep aloud there.
26556	43	11	32	 Mary then, when she came to Jesus and saw Him, fell at His feet and exclaimed, "Master, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."
26557	43	11	33	 Seeing her weeping aloud, and the Jews in like manner weeping who had come with her, Jesus,  curbing the strong  emotion of His spirit,
26558	43	11	34	 though deeply troubled, asked them, "Where have you laid him?" "Master, come and see," was their reply.
26559	43	11	35	 Jesus  wept.
26560	43	11	36	 "See how dear he held him," said the Jews.
26561	43	11	37	 But others of them asked, "Was this man who opened the blind man's eyes unable to prevent this man from dying?"
26562	43	11	38	 Jesus, however, again  restraining His strong feeling, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone had been laid against the mouth of it.
26563	43	11	39	 "Take away the stone," said Jesus. Martha, the sister of the dead man, exclaimed, "Master, by this time there is a foul smell; for  it is three days since he died."
26564	43	11	40	 "Did I not promise you," replied Jesus, "that if you believe, you shall see the glory of God?"
26565	43	11	41	 So they removed the stone. Then Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, "Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard me.
26566	43	11	42	 I know that Thou always hearest me; but for the sake of the crowd standing round I have said this--that they may believe that Thou didst send me."
26567	43	11	43	 After speaking thus, He called out in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out."
26568	43	11	44	 The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped in  cloths, and his face wrapped round with a  towel. "Untie him," said Jesus, "and let him go free."
26569	43	11	45	 Thereupon a considerable number of the Jews--namely those who had come to Mary and had witnessed His deeds--became believers in Him;
26570	43	11	46	 though some of them went off to the Pharisees and told them what He had done.
26571	43	11	47	 Therefore the High Priests and the Pharisees held a meeting of the Sanhedrin. "What steps are we taking?" they asked one another; "for this man is performing a great number of miracles.
26572	43	11	48	 If we leave him alone in this way, everybody will believe in him, and the Romans will come and blot out both our  city and our nation."
26573	43	11	49	 But one of them, named Caiaphas, being High Priest that year, said, "You know nothing about it.
26574	43	11	50	 You do not reflect that it is to your interest that one man should die for the people rather than the whole nation perish."
26575	43	11	51	 It was not  as a mere man that he thus spoke. But being High Priest that year he was inspired to declare that Jesus was to die for the nation,
26576	43	11	52	 and not for the nation only, but in order to unite into one body all the far-scattered children of God.
26577	43	11	53	 So from that day forward they planned and schemed in order to put Him to death.
26578	43	11	54	 Therefore Jesus no longer went about openly among the Jews, but He left that neighbourhood and went into the district near the Desert, to a town called Ephraim, and remained there with the disciples.
26579	43	11	55	 The Jewish Passover was coming near, and many  from that district went up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.
26580	43	11	56	 They therefore looked out for Jesus, and asked one another as they stood in the Temple, "What do you think? --will he come to the Festival at all?"
26581	43	11	57	 Now the High Priests and the Pharisees had issued orders that if any one knew where He was, he should give information, so that they might arrest Him.
26582	43	12	1	  Jesus,  however, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was whom He had raised from the dead.
26583	43	12	2	 So they gave a dinner there in honour of Jesus, at which Martha waited at table, but Lazarus was one of the guests who were with Him.
26584	43	12	3	 Availing herself of the opportunity, Mary took a pound weight of  pure spikenard, very costly, and poured it over His feet, and wiped His feet with her hair, so that the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
26585	43	12	4	 Then said Judas (the Iscariot, one of the Twelve--the one who afterwards betrayed Jesus),
26586	43	12	5	 "Why was not that perfume sold for 300 shillings and the money given to the poor?"
26587	43	12	6	 The reason he said this was not that he cared for the poor, but that he was a thief, and that being in charge of the  money-box, he used to steal what was put into it.
26588	43	12	7	 But Jesus interposed. "Do not blame her," He said,  "allow her to have kept it for the time of my preparation for burial.
26589	43	12	8	 For the poor you always have with you, but you have not me always."
26590	43	12	9	 Now it became widely known among the Jews that Jesus was there; but they came not only on His account, but also in order to see Lazarus whom He had brought back to life.
26591	43	12	10	 The High Priests, however, consulted together to put Lazarus also to death,
26592	43	12	11	 for because of him many of the Jews  left them and became believers in Jesus.
26593	43	12	12	  The next day a great crowd of those who had come to the Festival, hearing that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
26594	43	12	13	 took branches of  the palm trees and went out to meet Him, shouting as they went, "God save him! <Blessings on him who comes in the name of the Lord>--even on the King of Israel!"
26595	43	12	14	 And Jesus, having procured a young ass, sat upon it, just as the Scripture says,
26596	43	12	15	 <"Fear not,  Daughter of Zion! See, thy King is coming riding on an ass's colt.">
26597	43	12	16	 The meaning of this His disciples did not understand at the time; but after Jesus was glorified they recollected that this was written about Him, and that they had done this to Him.
26598	43	12	17	 The large number of people,  however, who had been present when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and brought him back to life, related what they had witnessed.
26599	43	12	18	 This was also why the crowd came to meet Him, because they had heard of His having performed that miracle.
26600	43	12	19	 The result was that the Pharisees said among themselves,  "Observe how idle all your efforts are! The world is gone after him!"
26601	43	12	20	 Now some of those who used  to come up to worship at the Festival were Greeks.
26602	43	12	21	  They came to Philip, of Bethsaida in Galilee, with the request, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus."
26603	43	12	22	 Philip came and told Andrew: Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
26604	43	12	23	 His answer was, "The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
26605	43	12	24	 In most solemn truth I tell you that unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains what it was--a single grain; but that if it dies, it yields a rich harvest.
26606	43	12	25	 He who holds  his life dear, is destroying it; and he who  makes his life of no account in this world  shall keep it to the Life  of the Ages.
26607	43	12	26	 If a man wishes to be my servant, let him follow me; and where I am, there too shall my servant be. If a man wishes to be my servant, the Father will honour him.
26608	43	12	27	 Now is my soul full of trouble; and what shall I say? Father,  save me from this hour. But  for this purpose I have come to this hour.
26609	43	12	28	 Father, glorify Thy name." Thereupon there came a voice from the sky, "I have glorified it and will also glorify it again."
26610	43	12	29	 The crowd that  stood by and heard it, said that there had been thunder. Others said, "An angel spoke to him."
26611	43	12	30	 "It is not for my sake," said Jesus, "that that voice came, but for your sakes.
26612	43	12	31	 Now  is a judgement of this world: now will the Prince of this world be driven out.
26613	43	12	32	 And I--  if I am lifted up  from the earth--will draw all men to me."
26614	43	12	33	 He said this to indicate the kind of death He would die.
26615	43	12	34	 The crowd answered Him, "We have heard out of the Law that the Christ remains for ever. In what sense do you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is that Son of Man?"
26616	43	12	35	 "Yet a little while," He replied, "the light is among you.  Be faithful to the light that you have, for fear darkness should  overtake you; for a man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going.
26617	43	12	36	  In the degree that you have light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of Light." Jesus said this, and went away and  hid Himself from them.
26618	43	12	37	 But though He had performed  such great miracles in their presence, they did not believe in Him--
26619	43	12	38	 in order that the words of Isaiah the Prophet might be fulfilled, <"Lord, who has believed our preaching? And the arm of the Lord--to whom has it been unveiled?">
26620	43	12	39	 For this reason they were unable to believe--because Isaiah said again,
26621	43	12	40	 <"He has blinded their eyes and made their minds callous, lest they should see with their eyes and perceive with their minds, and should turn, and I should heal them.">
26622	43	12	41	 Isaiah uttered these words because he saw His glory; and he spoke of Him.
26623	43	12	42	 Nevertheless even from among the Rulers many believed in Him. But because of the Pharisees they did not avow their belief, for fear they should be shut out from the synagogue.
26624	43	12	43	 For they loved the glory that comes from men rather than the glory that comes from God.
26625	43	12	44	 But Jesus  cried aloud, "He who believes in me, believes not so much in me, as in Him who sent me;
26626	43	12	45	 and he who sees me sees Him who sent me.
26627	43	12	46	 I have come like light into the world, in order that no one who believes in me may remain in the dark.
26628	43	12	47	 And if any one hears my teachings and  regards them not, I do  not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.
26629	43	12	48	 He who sets me at naught and does not receive my teachings is not left without a judge: the Message which  I have spoken will judge him on the last day.
26630	43	12	49	 Because I have not spoken on my own authority; but the Father who sent me, Himself  gave me a command what to say and in what words to speak.
26631	43	12	50	 And I know that  His command is the Life of the Ages. What therefore I speak, I speak just as the Father has bidden me."
26632	43	13	1	  Now just before the Feast of the Passover this incident took place. Jesus knew that the time had come for Him to leave this world and go to the Father; and having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them  to the end.
26633	43	13	2	 While supper was proceeding, the Devil having by this time suggested to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, the thought of betraying Him, Jesus,
26634	43	13	3	 although He knew that the Father had put everything into His hands, and that He had come forth from God and was now going to God,
26635	43	13	4	 rose from the table, threw off His upper garments, and took a towel and tied it round Him.
26636	43	13	5	 Then He poured water into a basin, and proceeded to wash the feet of the disciples and to wipe them with the towel which He had put round Him.
26637	43	13	6	  When He came to Simon Peter, Peter objected. "Master," he said, "are *you* going to wash my feet?"
26638	43	13	7	 "What I am doing," answered Jesus, "for the present you do not know, but afterwards you shall know."
26639	43	13	8	 "Never, while the world lasts," said Peter, "shall you wash my feet." "If I do not wash you," replied Jesus, "you have no share with me."
26640	43	13	9	 "Master," said Peter, "wash not only my feet, but also my hands and my head."
26641	43	13	10	 "Any one who has lately bathed," said Jesus, "does not need to wash  more than his feet, but is clean all over. And you my disciples are clean, and yet this is not true of all of you."
26642	43	13	11	 For He knew who was betraying Him, and that was why He said, "You are not all of you clean."
26643	43	13	12	 So after He had washed their feet, put on His garments again, and returned to the table, He said to them, "Do you understand what I have done to you?
26644	43	13	13	 You call me `The  Rabbi' and `The  Master,' and rightly so, for such I am.
26645	43	13	14	 If I then, your Master and Rabbi, have washed your feet, it is also your duty to wash one another's feet.
26646	43	13	15	 For I have set you an example in order that you may do what I have done to you.
26647	43	13	16	 In most solemn truth I tell you that a servant is not superior to his master, nor is a messenger superior to him who sent him.
26648	43	13	17	 If you know all this, blessed are you if you act accordingly.
26649	43	13	18	 I am not speaking of all of you. I know whom I have chosen, but things are as they are in order that the Scripture may be fulfilled, which says, <`He who eats  my bread has lifted up his heel against me.'>
26650	43	13	19	 From this time forward I tell you things before they happen, in order that when they do happen you may believe that  I am He.
26651	43	13	20	 In most solemn truth I tell you that he who receives whoever I send receives me, and that he who receives me receives Him who sent me."
26652	43	13	21	  After speaking thus Jesus was troubled in spirit and said with deep earnestness, "In most solemn truth I tell you that one of you will betray me."
26653	43	13	22	 The disciples began looking at one another, at a loss to know to which of them He was referring.
26654	43	13	23	 There was at table one of His disciples--the one Jesus  loved--  reclining with his head on Jesus's bosom.
26655	43	13	24	 Making a sign therefore to him, Simon Peter said, "Tell us to whom he is referring."
26656	43	13	25	 So he, having his head on Jesus's bosom, leaned back and asked, "Master, who is it?"
26657	43	13	26	 "It is the one," answered Jesus, "for whom I shall  dip this piece of bread and to whom I shall give it." Accordingly He dipped the piece of bread, and took it and gave it to Judas, the son of the Iscariot Simon.
26658	43	13	27	 Then, after Judas had received the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. "Lose no time  about it," said Jesus to him.
26659	43	13	28	 But why He said this no one else at the table understood.
26660	43	13	29	 Some,  however, supposed that because Judas had the money-box Jesus meant, "Buy what we require for the Festival," or that he should give something to the poor.
26661	43	13	30	 So Judas took the piece of bread and immediately went out. And it was night.
26662	43	13	31	 So when he was gone out, Jesus said, "Now  is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him.
26663	43	13	32	 Moreover God will glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him without delay.
26664	43	13	33	  Dear children, I am still with you a little longer. You will seek me, but, as I said to the Jews, `Where I am going you cannot come,' so for the present I say to you.
26665	43	13	34	 A new commandment I give you,  to love one another; that as I have loved you, you also may love one another.
26666	43	13	35	 It is by this that every one will know that you are my disciples--if you love one another."
26667	43	13	36	  "Master," inquired Simon Peter, "where are you going?" "Where I am going," replied Jesus, "you cannot be my follower now, but you shall be later."
26668	43	13	37	 "Master," asked Peter again, "why cannot I follow you now? I will lay down my  life on your behalf.
26669	43	13	38	 "You say you will lay down your life on my behalf!" said Jesus; "in most solemn truth I tell you that  the cock will not crow before you have three times disowned me."
26670	43	14	1	 "Let not your hearts be troubled.  Trust in God: trust in me also.
26671	43	14	2	 In my Father's house there are many resting-places. Were it otherwise, I would have told you; for I am going  to make ready a place for you.
26672	43	14	3	 And  if I go and make ready a place for you, I will return and  take you to be with me, that where I am you also may be.
26673	43	14	4	 And where I am going, you all know the way."
26674	43	14	5	 "Master," said Thomas, "we do not know where you are going.  In what sense do we know the way?"
26675	43	14	6	 "I am the Way," replied Jesus, "and the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
26676	43	14	7	 If you--all of you--knew me, you would fully know my Father also. From this time forward you know Him and have seen Him."
26677	43	14	8	 "Master," said Philip, "cause us to see the Father: that is all we need."
26678	43	14	9	 "Have I been so long among you," Jesus answered, "and yet you, Philip, do not know me? He who has seen me has seen the Father. How can *you* ask me, `Cause us to see the Father'?
26679	43	14	10	 Do you not  believe that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me? The things that I tell you all I do not speak on my own authority: but the Father  dwelling within me carries on His own  work.
26680	43	14	11	 Believe me, all of you, that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me; or at any rate,  believe me because of what I do.
26681	43	14	12	 In most solemn truth I tell you that he who trusts in me--the things which I do he shall do also; and greater things than these he shall do, because I am going to the Father.
26682	43	14	13	 And whatever any of you ask  in my name, I will do, in order that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
26683	43	14	14	 If you make any request  of me in my name, I will do it.
26684	43	14	15	 "If you love me, you will obey my commandments.
26685	43	14	16	 And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another  Advocate to be for ever with you--the Spirit of truth.
26686	43	14	17	 That Spirit the world cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know Him. You know Him, because He remains by your side and is in you.
26687	43	14	18	 I will not leave you  bereaved: I am coming to you.
26688	43	14	19	 Yet a little while and the world  will see me no more, but you will see me: because I live, you also shall live.
26689	43	14	20	 At that time you will know that I am in my Father, and that you are in me, and that I am in you.
26690	43	14	21	 He who has my commandments and obeys them--he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will clearly reveal myself to him."
26691	43	14	22	 Judas (not the Iscariot) asked, "Master,  how is it that you will reveal yourself clearly to us and not to the world?"
26692	43	14	23	 "If any one loves me," replied Jesus, "he will obey my  teaching; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home  with him.
26693	43	14	24	 He who has no love for me does not obey my teaching; and yet the teaching to which you are listening is not mine, but is the teaching of the Father who sent me.
26694	43	14	25	 "All this I have spoken to you while still with you.
26695	43	14	26	 But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send  at my request, will teach you everything, and will bring to your memories  all that I have said to you.
26696	43	14	27	 Peace I leave with you: my own peace I give to you. It is not as the world gives its greetings that I give you peace. Let not your hearts be troubled or dismayed.
26697	43	14	28	 "You heard me say to you, `I am going away, and yet I am coming to you.' If you loved me, you would have rejoiced because I am going to the Father; for the Father is  greater than I am.
26698	43	14	29	 I have now told you before it comes to pass, that when it has come to pass you may believe.
26699	43	14	30	 In future I shall not talk much with you, for the  Prince  of this world is coming. And yet in me he has nothing;
26700	43	14	31	 but it is in order that the world may know that I love the Father, and that it is in obedience to the command which the Father gave me that I thus act. Rise, let us be going."
26701	43	15	1	 "I am the Vine--the True Vine, and my Father is the vine-dresser.
26702	43	15	2	 Every branch in me--if it bears no fruit, He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit.
26703	43	15	3	 Already you are cleansed--through the  teaching which I have given you.
26704	43	15	4	 Continue in me, and let me continue in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself--that is, if it does not continue in the vine--so neither can you if you do not continue in me.
26705	43	15	5	 I am the Vine, you are the branches. He who continues in me and in whom I continue bears abundant fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.
26706	43	15	6	 If any one does not continue in me, he is like the unfruitful branch  which is at once thrown away and then withers up. Such branches they gather up and throw into the fire and they are burned.
26707	43	15	7	 "If you continue in me and my  sayings continue in you, ask what you will and it shall be done for you.
26708	43	15	8	 By this  is God glorified--by your bearing abundant fruit and thus being true disciples of mine.
26709	43	15	9	 As the Father  has loved me,  I have also loved you: continue in my love.
26710	43	15	10	 If you obey my commands, you will continue in my love, as I have obeyed my Father's commands and continue in His love.
26711	43	15	11	 "These things  I have spoken to you in order that I may have joy in you, and that your joy may become perfect.
26712	43	15	12	 This is my commandment to you, to love one another as I have loved you.
26713	43	15	13	 No one has greater love than this--a man laying down his life for his friends.
26714	43	15	14	 You are my friends, if you do what I command you.
26715	43	15	15	 No longer do I call you  servants, because a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, because all that I have heard from the Father I have made known to you.
26716	43	15	16	 It is not you who chose me, but it is I who chose you and appointed you that you might go and be fruitful and that your fruit might remain; so that whatever petition you present to the Father in my name He may give you.
26717	43	15	17	 "Thus I command you to love one another.
26718	43	15	18	 If the world hates you, remember that it has first had me as the fixed object of its hatred.
26719	43	15	19	 If you belonged to the world, the world would love its own property. But because you do not belong to the world, and I have chosen you out of the world--for that reason the world hates you.
26720	43	15	20	 Bear in mind what I said to you, `A servant is not superior to his master.' If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you: if they have obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also.
26721	43	15	21	 But they will inflict all this suffering upon you on account of your bearing my name--because they do not know Him who sent me.
26722	43	15	22	 "If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have had no sin; but as the case stands they are without excuse for their sin.
26723	43	15	23	 He who hates me hates my Father also.
26724	43	15	24	 If I had not done among them,  as I have, such miracles as no one else ever did, they would have had no sin; but they  have in fact seen and also hated both me and my Father.
26725	43	15	25	 But this has been so, in order that the saying may be fulfilled which stands written in their Law, <`They have hated me without any reason.'>
26726	43	15	26	 "When the Advocate is come whom I will send to you from the Father's presence--the Spirit of Truth who comes forth from the Father's presence--He will be a witness concerning me.
26727	43	15	27	 And you also are witnesses, because you have been with me from the first.
26728	43	16	1	 "These things I have spoken to you in order to clear stumbling-blocks out of your path.
26729	43	16	2	 You will be excluded from the synagogues; nay more, the time is coming when any one who has murdered one of you will suppose he is offering service to God.
26730	43	16	3	 And they will do these things because they have failed to recognize  the Father and to discover who I am.
26731	43	16	4	 But I have spoken these things to you in order that when the time for their accomplishment comes you may remember them, and may recollect that I told you. I did not, however, tell you all this at first, because I was still with you.
26732	43	16	5	 But now I an returning to Him who sent me; and not one of you  asks me where I am going.
26733	43	16	6	 But grief has filled your hearts because I have said all this to you.
26734	43	16	7	 "Yet it is the truth that  I am telling you--it is to your advantage that I go away. For unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.
26735	43	16	8	 And He, when He comes, will  convict the world in respect of sin, of righteousness, and of judgement; --
26736	43	16	9	 of sin, because they do not believe in me;
26737	43	16	10	 of righteousness, because I am going to the Father, and  you will no longer see me;
26738	43	16	11	 of judgement, because the Prince of this world is under sentence.
26739	43	16	12	 "I have much more to say to you, but you are unable at present to bear the burden of it.
26740	43	16	13	 But when He has come--the Spirit of Truth--He will guide you into all the truth. For He will not speak as Himself originating what He says, but  all that He hears He will speak, and He will make known  the future to you.
26741	43	16	14	 He will glorify me, because He will take of what is mine and will make it known to you.
26742	43	16	15	 Everything that the Father has is mine; that is why I said that the Spirit of Truth takes of what is mine and will make it known to you.
26743	43	16	16	 "A little while and you see me no more, and again a little while and you shall see me."
26744	43	16	17	 Some of His disciples therefore said to one another, "What does this mean which He is telling us, `A little while and you do not see me, and again a little while and you shall see me,' and  `Because I am going to the Father'?"
26745	43	16	18	 So they asked one another repeatedly, "What can that `little while' mean which He speaks of? We do not understand His words."
26746	43	16	19	 Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask Him, and He said, "Is this what you are questioning one another about--my saying, `A little while and you do not see me, and again a little while and you shall see me'?
26747	43	16	20	 In most solemn truth I tell you that you will weep aloud and lament, but the world will be glad. You will mourn, but your grief will be turned into gladness.
26748	43	16	21	 A woman, when she is in labour, has sorrow, because her time has come. But when she has given birth to the babe, she no longer remembers the pain, because of her joy at a child being born into the world.
26749	43	16	22	 So you also now have sorrow; but  I shall see you again, and your hearts will be glad, and your gladness no one will take away from you.
26750	43	16	23	 You will put no questions to me  then. "In most solemn truth I tell you that whatever you ask the Father for in my name He will give you.
26751	43	16	24	 As yet you have not asked for anything  in my name: ask, and you shall receive, that your hearts may be filled with gladness.
26752	43	16	25	 "All this I have spoken to you in veiled language. The time is coming when I shall no longer speak to you in veiled language, but  will tell you about the Father in plain words.
26753	43	16	26	  At that time you will make your requests in my name; and I do not promise to ask the Father on your behalf,
26754	43	16	27	 for the Father Himself holds you dear, because you  have held me dear and have believed that I came from the Father's presence.
26755	43	16	28	 I came  from the Father and have come into the world. Again I am leaving the world and am going to the Father."
26756	43	16	29	 "Ah, now you are using plain language," said His disciples, "and are uttering no figure of speech!
26757	43	16	30	 Now we know that you have all knowledge, and do not need to be pressed with questions. Through this we believe that you came from God."
26758	43	16	31	 "Do you at last believe?" replied Jesus.
26759	43	16	32	 "Remember that the time is coming, nay, has already come, for you all to be dispersed each to his own home and to leave me alone. And yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.
26760	43	16	33	 "I have spoken all this to you in order that in me you may have peace. In the world you have affliction. But keep up your courage: *I* have won the victory over the world."
26761	43	17	1	 When Jesus had thus spoken, He raised his eyes towards Heaven and said, "Father, the hour has come. Glorify Thy Son that the Son may glorify Thee;
26762	43	17	2	 even as Thou hast given Him authority over all mankind, so that on all whom Thou hast given Him He may bestow the Life of the Ages.
26763	43	17	3	 And in this consists the Life of the Ages--in  knowing Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.
26764	43	17	4	 I have glorified Thee on earth, having done perfectly the work which  by Thine appointment has been mine to do.
26765	43	17	5	 And now, Father, do Thou glorify me in Thine own presence, with the glory that I had in Thy presence before the world existed.
26766	43	17	6	 "I have revealed Thy  perfections to the men whom Thou gavest me out of the world. Thine they were, and Thou gavest them to me, and  they have obeyed Thy message.
26767	43	17	7	 Now they know that whatever Thou hast given me is  from Thee.
26768	43	17	8	 For the truths which Thou didst  teach me I have taught them. And they have received them, and have known for certain that I came out from Thy presence, and have believed that Thou didst send me.
26769	43	17	9	  "I am making request  for them: for the world  I do not make any request, but for those whom Thou hast given me. Because they are Thine,
26770	43	17	10	 and everything that is mine is Thine, and everything that is Thine is mine; and I  am crowned with glory in them.
26771	43	17	11	 I am now no longer in the world, but they are in the world and I am coming to Thee. "Holy Father, keep them  true to Thy name--the name which Thou hast given me  to bear--that they may be one, even as we are.
26772	43	17	12	 While I was with them, I kept them true to Thy name--the name Thou hast given me  to bear--and I kept watch over them, and not one of them is lost but only he who is  doomed to destruction--that the Scripture may be fulfilled.
26773	43	17	13	 "But now I am coming to Thee, and I speak these words while I am in the world, in order that they may have my gladness within them filling their hearts.
26774	43	17	14	 I have given them Thy  Message, and the world has hated them, because they do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world.
26775	43	17	15	 I do not ask that Thou wilt remove them out of the world, but that Thou wilt protect them from  the Evil one.
26776	43	17	16	 They do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world.
26777	43	17	17	 Make them holy  in the truth: Thy  Message is truth.
26778	43	17	18	 Just as Thou didst send me into the world, I also  have sent them;
26779	43	17	19	 and on their behalf I  consecrate myself, in order that they may become perfectly consecrated in truth.
26780	43	17	20	 "Nor is it for them alone that I make request. It is also for  those who trust in me through their teaching;
26781	43	17	21	 that they may all be one, even as Thou art in me, O Father, and I am in Thee; that they also may be in us; that the world  may believe that Thou didst send me.
26782	43	17	22	 And the glory which Thou hast given me  I have given them, that they may be one, just as we are one:
26783	43	17	23	 I in them and Thou in me; that they may stand perfected  in one; that the world may come to understand that Thou didst send me and hast loved them with the same love as that with which Thou hast loved me.
26784	43	17	24	 "Father,  those whom Thou hast given me--I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they  may see the glory--my glory--my gift from Thee, which Thou hast given me because Thou didst love me before the creation of the world.
26785	43	17	25	  And, righteous Father, though the world has failed to recognize Thee, I have known Thee, and these have perceived that Thou didst send me.
26786	43	17	26	 And I have made known Thy  name to them and will make it known, that the love with which Thou hast loved me may be in them, and that I may be in them."
26787	43	18	1	  After offering this prayer Jesus went out with His disciples to a place on the further side of the Ravine of the Cedars, where there was a garden which He entered--Himself and His disciples.
26788	43	18	2	  Now Judas also, who at that very time was betraying Him, knew the place, for Jesus had often resorted there with His disciples.
26789	43	18	3	 So Judas,  followed by the battalion and by a detachment of the Temple police sent by the High Priests and Pharisees, came there with torches and lamps and weapons.
26790	43	18	4	 Jesus therefore, knowing all that was about to befall Him, went out to meet them.  "Who are you looking for?" He asked them.
26791	43	18	5	 "For Jesus the Nazarene," was the answer. "I am he," He replied. (Now Judas who was betraying Him was also standing with them.)
26792	43	18	6	 As soon then as He said to them, "I am he," they went backwards and  fell to the ground.
26793	43	18	7	 Again therefore He asked them,  "Who are you looking for?" "For Jesus the Nazarene," they said.
26794	43	18	8	 "I have told you," replied Jesus, "that I am he. If therefore you are looking for me, let these my disciples go their way."
26795	43	18	9	 He made this request in order that the words He had spoken might be fulfilled, "As for those whom Thou hast given me, I have not lost one."
26796	43	18	10	 Simon Peter, however, having a sword, drew it, and, aiming at the High Priest's  servant, cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.
26797	43	18	11	 Jesus therefore said to Peter, "Put back your sword. Shall I refuse to drink the cup of sorrow which the Father has given me to drink?"
26798	43	18	12	  So the battalion and their  tribune and the Jewish police closed in, and took Jesus and bound Him.
26799	43	18	13	 They then brought Him to  Annas first; for Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was High Priest that year.
26800	43	18	14	 (It was this Caiaphas who had advised the Jews, saying, "It is to your interest that one man should die for the People.")
26801	43	18	15	 Meanwhile Simon Peter was following Jesus, and so also was another disciple. The latter was known to the High Priest, and went in with Jesus into the court of the High Priest's palace.
26802	43	18	16	 But Peter remained standing outside the door, till the disciple who was acquainted with the High Priest came out and induced the portress to let Peter in.
26803	43	18	17	 This led the girl, the portress, to ask Peter, "Are you also one of this man's disciples?" "No, I am not," he replied.
26804	43	18	18	 Now because it was cold the  servants and the police had lighted a  charcoal fire, and were standing and warming themselves; and Peter too remained with them, standing and warming himself.
26805	43	18	19	  So the High Priest questioned Jesus about His disciples and His teaching.
26806	43	18	20	 "As for me," replied Jesus,  "I have spoken  openly to the world. I  have continually taught in some synagogue or in the Temple where all the Jews are wont to assemble, and I have said nothing in secret.
26807	43	18	21	 Why do you question me? Question  those who heard what it was I said to them: these witnesses here know what I said."
26808	43	18	22	 Upon His saying this, one of the officers standing by struck Him  with his open hand, asking Him as he did so, "Is that the way you answer the High Priest?"
26809	43	18	23	 "If I have spoken wrongly," replied Jesus, "bear witness to it as wrong; but if rightly, why that blow?"
26810	43	18	24	  So Annas  sent Him bound to Caiaphas the High Priest.
26811	43	18	25	 But Simon Peter remained standing and  warming himself, and this led to their asking him, "Are you also one of his disciples?" He denied it, and said, "No, I am not."
26812	43	18	26	 One of the High Priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Did I not see you in the garden with him?"
26813	43	18	27	 Once more Peter denied it, and immediately a cock crowed.
26814	43	18	28	  So they brought Jesus from Caiaphas's house to the  Praetorium. It was the early morning, and they would not enter the Praetorium themselves for fear of defilement, and in order that they might be able to eat the Passover.
26815	43	18	29	  Accordingly Pilate  came out to them and inquired, "What accusation have you to bring against this man?"
26816	43	18	30	 "If the man were not a criminal," they replied, "we would not have handed him over to you."
26817	43	18	31	 "Take him yourselves," said Pilate, "and judge him by your Law." "We have no power," replied the Jews, "to put any man to death."
26818	43	18	32	 They said this that the words might be fulfilled in which Jesus predicted the kind of death He was to die.
26819	43	18	33	  Re-entering the Praetorium, therefore, Pilate called Jesus and asked Him, "Are *you* the King of the Jews?"
26820	43	18	34	 "Do you say this of yourself, or have others told it you about me?" replied Jesus.
26821	43	18	35	 "Am I a Jew?" exclaimed Pilate; "it is your own nation and the High Priests who have handed you over to me. What have you done?"
26822	43	18	36	 "My kingdom," replied Jesus, "does not belong to this world. If my kingdom did belong to this world, my subjects  would have resolutely fought to save me from being delivered up to the Jews. But, as a matter of fact, my kingdom has not this origin."
26823	43	18	37	 "So then *you* are a king!" rejoined Pilate. "Yes," said Jesus, "you say truly that I am a king. For this purpose  I was born, and for this purpose I have come into the world--to give testimony for the truth. Every one who is  a friend of the truth listens to my voice."
26824	43	18	38	 "What is truth?" said Pilate. But no sooner had he spoken the words than he went out again to the Jews and told them, "I find no crime in him.
26825	43	18	39	  But you have a custom that I should release one prisoner to you at the Passover. So shall I release to you the King of the Jews?"
26826	43	18	40	 With a roar of voices they again cried out, saying, "Not this man, but Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a robber.
26827	43	19	1	 Then Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him.
26828	43	19	2	 And the soldiers, twisting twigs of thorn into a wreath, put it on His head, and threw round Him a crimson cloak.
26829	43	19	3	 Then they began to march up to Him, saying in a mocking voice, "Hail King of the Jews!" And they struck Him with the palms of their hands.
26830	43	19	4	 Once more Pilate  came out and said to the Jews, "See, I am bringing him out to you to let you clearly understand that I find no crime in him."
26831	43	19	5	 So Jesus came out, wearing the wreath of thorns and the crimson cloak. And Pilate said to them, "See, there is the man."
26832	43	19	6	 As soon then as the High Priests and the officers saw Him, they shouted "To the cross! To the cross!" "Take him yourselves and crucify him," said Pilate; "for I, at any rate, find no crime in him."
26833	43	19	7	 "We," replied the Jews, "have a Law, and in accordance with that Law he ought to die, for having claimed to be the Son of God."
26834	43	19	8	 More alarmed than ever, Pilate no sooner heard these words than he re-entered the Praetorium and began to question Jesus.
26835	43	19	9	 "What is your origin?" he asked. But Jesus gave him no answer.
26836	43	19	10	 "Do you refuse to speak even to me?" asked Pilate; "do you not know that I have it in my power either to release you or to crucify you?"
26837	43	19	11	 "You would have had no power whatever over me," replied Jesus, "had it not been granted you from above. On that account he who has delivered me up to you is more guilty than you are."
26838	43	19	12	 Upon receiving this answer, Pilate was for releasing Him. But the Jews  kept shouting, "If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar's. Every one who sets himself up as king declares himself a rebel against Caesar."
26839	43	19	13	 On hearing this, Pilate brought Jesus out, and  sat down on the judge's seat in a place called the Pavement--or in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
26840	43	19	14	 It was the day of Preparation for the Passover, about  six o'clock in the morning. Then he said to the Jews, "There is your king!"
26841	43	19	15	 This caused a storm of outcries, "Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!" "Am I to crucify your king?" Pilate asked. "We have no king, except Caesar," answered the High Priests.
26842	43	19	16	  Then Pilate gave Him up to them to be crucified. Accordingly they took Jesus;
26843	43	19	17	  and He went out carrying His own cross, to the place called Skull-place--or, in Hebrew, Golgotha--
26844	43	19	18	  where they nailed Him to a cross, and two others at the same time, one on each side and Jesus in the middle.
26845	43	19	19	 And Pilate wrote a notice and had it fastened to the top of the cross. It ran thus: JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
26846	43	19	20	 Many of the Jews read this notice, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the notice was in three languages--Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.
26847	43	19	21	 This led the Jewish High Priests to remonstrate with Pilate. "You should not write `The King of the Jews,'" they said, "but that he claimed to be King of the Jews."
26848	43	19	22	 "What I have written I have written," was Pilate's answer.
26849	43	19	23	 So the soldiers, as soon as they had crucified Jesus, took His garments, including His  tunic, and divided them into four parts--one part for each soldier. The tunic was without seam, woven from the top in one piece.
26850	43	19	24	 So they said to one another, "Do not let us tear it. Let us draw lots for it." This happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says, <"They shared my garments among them, and drew lots for my clothing."> That was just what the soldiers did.
26851	43	19	25	  Now standing close to the cross of Jesus were His mother and His mother's sister,  Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala.
26852	43	19	26	 So Jesus, seeing His mother, and seeing the disciple whom He loved standing near, said to His mother,  "Behold, your son!"
26853	43	19	27	 Then He said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother!" And from that time the disciple received her into his own home.
26854	43	19	28	  After this, Jesus, knowing that everything was now brought to an end, said--that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "I am thirsty."
26855	43	19	29	 There was a jar of  wine standing there. With this wine they filled a sponge, put it on the end of a stalk of hyssop, and lifted it to His mouth.
26856	43	19	30	 As soon as Jesus had taken the wine, He said, "It is finished." And then, bowing His head, He yielded up His spirit.
26857	43	19	31	  Meanwhile the Jews, because it was the day of Preparation for the Passover, and in order that the bodies might not remain on the crosses during  the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was one of special solemnity), requested Pilate to have the legs of the dying men broken, and the bodies removed.
26858	43	19	32	 Accordingly the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and also of the other who had been crucified with Jesus.
26859	43	19	33	 Then they came to Jesus Himself: but when they saw that He was already dead, they refrained from breaking His legs.
26860	43	19	34	 One of the soldiers, however, made a thrust at His side with a lance, and immediately  blood and water flowed out.
26861	43	19	35	 This statement is the testimony of an eye-witness, and it is true. He knows that he is telling the truth--in order that you also may believe.
26862	43	19	36	 For all this took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled which declares, <"Not one of His bones shall be broken.">
26863	43	19	37	 And again another Scripture says, <"They shall look on Him whom they have pierced.">
26864	43	19	38	  After this, Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but for fear of the Jews a secret disciple, asked Pilate's permission to carry away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him leave. So he came and removed the body.
26865	43	19	39	 Nicodemus too--he who at first had visited Jesus by night--came bringing a  mixture of myrrh and aloes, in weight about  seventy or eighty pounds.
26866	43	19	40	 Taking down the body they wrapped it in linen cloths along with the spices, in accordance with the Jewish mode of preparing for burial.
26867	43	19	41	 There was a garden at the place where Jesus had been crucified, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried.
26868	43	19	42	 Therefore, because it was the day of Preparation for the Jewish Passover, and the tomb was close at hand, they put Jesus there.
26869	43	20	1	  On the first day of the week, very early, while it was still dark, Mary of Magdala came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been  removed from it.
26870	43	20	2	  So she ran, as fast as she could, to find Simon Peter and the other disciple--the one who was dear to Jesus--and to tell them, "They have taken the Master out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have put Him."
26871	43	20	3	  Peter and the other disciple started at once to go to the tomb, both of them running,
26872	43	20	4	 but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and reached it before he did.
26873	43	20	5	  Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying there on the ground, but he did not go in.
26874	43	20	6	 Simon Peter, however, also came, following him, and entered the tomb. There on the ground he saw the cloths;
26875	43	20	7	 and the  towel, which had been placed  over the face of Jesus, not lying with the cloths, but folded up and put by itself.
26876	43	20	8	 Then the other disciple, who had been the first to come to the tomb, also went in and saw and was convinced.
26877	43	20	9	 For until now they had not understood the inspired teaching, that He must rise again from among the dead.
26878	43	20	10	 Then they went away and returned home.
26879	43	20	11	  Meanwhile Mary remained standing near the tomb, weeping aloud. She did not enter the tomb, but as she wept she stooped and looked in,
26880	43	20	12	 and  saw two angels clothed in white raiment, sitting one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been.
26881	43	20	13	 They spoke to her.  "Why are you weeping?" they asked. "Because," she replied, "they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have put him."
26882	43	20	14	 While she was speaking, she turned round and saw Jesus standing there, but did not recognize Him.
26883	43	20	15	  "Why are you weeping?" He asked;  "who are you looking for?" She, supposing that He was the gardener, replied, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him and I will remove him."
26884	43	20	16	 "Mary!" said Jesus. She turned to Him.  "Rabboni!" she cried in Hebrew: the word means `Teacher!'
26885	43	20	17	  "Do not cling to me," said Jesus, "for I have not yet ascended to the Father.  But take this message to my brethren: `I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"
26886	43	20	18	 Mary of Magdala came and brought word to the disciples. "I have seen the Master," she said. And she told them that He had said these things to her.
26887	43	20	19	  On that same first day of the week, when it was evening and, for fear of the Jews, the doors of the house where the disciples were, were locked, Jesus came and stood in their midst, and said to them, "Peace be to you!"
26888	43	20	20	 Having said this He showed them His hands and also His side; and the disciples were filled with joy at seeing the Master.
26889	43	20	21	 A second time, therefore,  He said to them, "Peace be to you! As the Father sent me, I also now send you."
26890	43	20	22	 Having said this He breathed upon them and said, "Receive  the Holy Spirit.
26891	43	20	23	 If you remit the sins of any persons, they  remain remitted to them. If you bind fast the sins of any, they remain bound."
26892	43	20	24	 Thomas, one of the twelve--surnamed `the Twin' --was not among them when Jesus came.
26893	43	20	25	 So the rest of the disciples told him, "We have seen the Master!" His reply was, "Unless I see in his hands the wound made by the nails and put my  finger into the wound, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe it."
26894	43	20	26	 A week later the disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them, when Jesus came--though the doors were locked--and stood in their midst, and said, "Peace be to you."
26895	43	20	27	 Then He said to Thomas, "Bring your finger here and  feel my hands; bring you hand and put it into my side; and do not be ready to disbelieve but to believe."
26896	43	20	28	 "My Lord and my God!" replied Thomas.
26897	43	20	29	 "Because you have seen me," replied Jesus, "you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."
26898	43	20	30	  There were also a great number of other signs which Jesus performed in the presence of the disciples, which are not recorded in this book.
26899	43	20	31	 But these have been recorded in order that you may believe that He is the Christ, the Son of God, and that, through believing, you may have Life through His name.
26900	43	21	1	  After this, Jesus again showed Himself to the disciples. It was at the Lake of Tiberias. The circumstances were as follows.
26901	43	21	2	 Simon Peter was with Thomas, called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zabdi, and two others of the Master's disciples.
26902	43	21	3	 Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing." "We will go too," said they. So they set out and went on board their boat; but they caught nothing that night.
26903	43	21	4	 When, however, day was now dawning, Jesus stood on the beach, though the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
26904	43	21	5	 He called to them. "Children," He said, "have you any food there?" "No," they answered.
26905	43	21	6	 "Throw the net in on the right hand side," He said, "and you will find fish." So they threw the net in, and now they could scarcely drag it along for the quantity of fish.
26906	43	21	7	 This made the disciple whom Jesus  loved say to Peter, "It is the Master." Simon Peter therefore, when he heard the words, "It is the Master," drew on his  fisherman's shirt--for  he had not been wearing it--put on his girdle, and sprang into the water.
26907	43	21	8	 But the rest of the disciples came in the  small boat (for they were not far from land--only about a hundred yards off), dragging the net full of fish.
26908	43	21	9	 As soon as they landed, they saw a charcoal fire burning there, with fish broiling on it, and bread close by.
26909	43	21	10	 Jesus told them to fetch some of the fish which they had just caught.
26910	43	21	11	 So Simon Peter went on board  the boat and drew the net ashore full of large fish, 153 in number; and yet, although there were so many, the net had not broken.
26911	43	21	12	 "Come this way and have breakfast," said Jesus. But not one of the disciples ventured to question Him as to who He was, for they felt sure that it was the Master.
26912	43	21	13	 Then Jesus came and took the bread and gave them some, and the fish in the same way.
26913	43	21	14	 This was now the third occasion on which Jesus showed Himself to the disciples after He had risen from among the dead.
26914	43	21	15	 When they had finished breakfast, Jesus asked Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you  love me  more than these others do?" "Yes, Master," was his answer; "you know that you  are dear to me."  "Then feed my lambs," replied Jesus.
26915	43	21	16	 Again a second time He asked him, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" "Yes, Master," he said, "you know that you are dear to me." "Then be a shepherd to my sheep," He said.
26916	43	21	17	 A third time Jesus put the question: "Simon, son of John, am I dear to you?" It grieved Peter that Jesus asked him the third time, "Am I dear to you?" "Master," he replied, "you know everything, you can see that you are dear to me." "Then feed my  much-loved sheep," said Jesus.
26917	43	21	18	 "In most solemn truth I tell you that whereas, when you were young, you used to put on your girdle and walk whichever way you chose, when you have grown old you will stretch out your arms and  some one else will put  a girdle round you and  carry you where you have no wish to go."
26918	43	21	19	 This He said to indicate the kind of death by which that disciple would bring glory to God; and after speaking thus He said to him, "Follow me."
26919	43	21	20	 Peter turned round and noticed the disciple whom Jesus loved following--the one who at the supper had leaned back on His breast and had asked, "Master, who is it that is betraying you?"
26920	43	21	21	 On seeing him, Peter asked Jesus, "And, Master, what about him?"
26921	43	21	22	 "If I desire him to remain  till I come," replied Jesus, "what concern is that of yours? You, yourself, must follow me."
26922	43	21	23	 Hence the report spread among the brethren that that disciple would never die. Yet Jesus did not say, "He is not to die," but, "If I desire him to remain till I come,  what concern is that of yours?"
26923	43	21	24	 That is the disciple who gives his testimony as to these matters, and has written this history; and we know that his testimony is true.
26924	43	21	25	  But there are also many other things which Jesus did--so vast a number indeed that if they were all described in detail, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would have to be written.
26925	44	1	1	 My former narrative, Theophilus, dealt with all that Jesus did and taught  as a beginning, down to the day on which,
26926	44	1	2	 after giving instruction through the Holy Spirit to the Apostles whom He had chosen, He was  taken up to Heaven.
26927	44	1	3	 He had also, after He suffered,  shown Himself alive to them with many sure  proofs,  appearing to them at intervals during forty days, and speaking of the Kingdom of God.
26928	44	1	4	 And  while in their company He charged them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for the Father's promised gift. "This you have heard of," He said, "from me.
26929	44	1	5	 For John indeed baptized with water, but before many days have passed you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit."
26930	44	1	6	  Once when they were with Him, they asked Him, "Master, is this the time at which you are about to restore the kingdom of Israel?"
26931	44	1	7	 "It is not for you," He replied, "to know  times or epochs which  the Father has reserved within His own authority;
26932	44	1	8	  and yet you  will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judaea and Samaria and to the remotest parts of the earth."
26933	44	1	9	 When He had said this, and while they were looking at Him, He was carried up, and a cloud closing beneath Him hid Him from their sight.
26934	44	1	10	 But, while they stood intently gazing into the sky as He went, suddenly there were two men in white garments standing by them,
26935	44	1	11	 who said, "Galilaeans, why stand looking into  the sky? This same Jesus who has been taken up from you into  Heaven will come  in just the same way as you have seen Him going into Heaven."
26936	44	1	12	 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called the Oliveyard, which is near Jerusalem,  about a mile off.
26937	44	1	13	 They entered the city, and they went up  to the upper room which was now their fixed place for meeting. Their names were Peter and  John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the brother of James.
26938	44	1	14	 All of these with one mind continued earnest in prayer, together with some women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and His brothers.
26939	44	1	15	 It was on one of these days that Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren--the entire number of persons present being about 120--and said,
26940	44	1	16	  "Brethren, it was necessary that the Scripture should be fulfilled--the prediction, I mean, which the Holy Spirit uttered by the lips of David, about Judas, who acted as guide to those who arrested Jesus.
26941	44	1	17	 For Judas was reckoned as one of our number, and  a share in this ministry was allotted to him."
26942	44	1	18	  (Now having bought a piece of ground with the money paid for his wickedness he fell there with his face downwards, and, his body bursting open, he became disembowelled.
26943	44	1	19	 This fact became widely known to the people of Jerusalem, so that the place received the name, in their language, of Achel-damach, which means `The Field of Blood.')
26944	44	1	20	 "For it is written in the Book of Psalms, <"`Let his  encampment be desolate: let there be no one to dwell there';> and <"`His  work let another take up.'>
26945	44	1	21	 "It is necessary, therefore, that of the men who have been with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us--
26946	44	1	22	 beginning from His baptism by John down to the day on which He was taken up  again from us into Heaven--one should be appointed to become a witness with us as to His resurrection."
26947	44	1	23	 So  two names were proposed, Joseph called Bar-sabbas--and surnamed  Justus--and Matthias.
26948	44	1	24	 And the brethren prayed, saying, "Thou, Lord,  who knowest the hearts of all, show clearly which of these two Thou hast chosen
26949	44	1	25	 to occupy the place in this ministry and Apostleship  from which Judas  through transgression fell, in order to go to his own place."
26950	44	1	26	 Then they drew lots between them. The lot fell on Matthias, and a place among the eleven Apostles was voted to him.
26951	44	2	1	  At length, on the day of the Harvest Festival, they had all met in one place;
26952	44	2	2	 when suddenly there came from the sky a sound as of a strong rushing blast of wind. This filled the whole house where they were sitting;
26953	44	2	3	 and they saw tongues of what looked like fire  distributing themselves over the assembly, and on the head of each person a tongue alighted.
26954	44	2	4	 They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak  in foreign languages according as the Spirit gave them words to utter.
26955	44	2	5	 Now there were Jews  residing in Jerusalem, devout men from every part of the world.
26956	44	2	6	 So when  this noise was heard, they came crowding together, and were amazed because everyone heard his own language spoken.
26957	44	2	7	 They were beside themselves with wonder, and exclaimed, "Are not all these speakers Galilaeans?
26958	44	2	8	 How then does each of us hear his own native language spoken by them?
26959	44	2	9	 Some of us are  Parthians, Medes, Elamites. Some are  inhabitants of Mesopotamia, of Judaea or Cappadocia, of Pontus or  the Asian Province, of Phrygia or Pamphylia,
26960	44	2	10	 of Egypt or of the parts of Africa towards Cyrene. Others are visitors from Rome--being either Jews or converts from heathenism--and others are Cretans or Arabians.
26961	44	2	11	 Yet we all alike hear these Galilaeans speaking in our own language about the wonderful things which God has done."
26962	44	2	12	 They were all astounded and bewildered, and asked one another, "What can this mean?"
26963	44	2	13	 But others, scornfully jeering, said, "They are brim-full of  sweet wine."
26964	44	2	14	 Peter however, together with the Eleven, stood up and addressed them in a loud voice. "Men of Judaea, and all you inhabitants of Jerusalem," he said, "be in no uncertainty about this matter but pay attention to what I say.
26965	44	2	15	 For this is not intoxication, as you suppose, it being only the  third hour of the day.
26966	44	2	16	 But that which was predicted through the Prophet Joel has happened:
26967	44	2	17	 <"And it shall come to pass in  the last days, God says, that I will pour out  My Spirit upon all  mankind; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall have dreams;
26968	44	2	18	 and even upon My bondservants, both men and women, at that time, I will pour out  My Spirit, and they shall prophesy.
26969	44	2	19	 I will display marvels in the sky above, and signs on the earth below, blood and fire, and pillars of smoke.
26970	44	2	20	 The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, to usher in the day of the Lord--  that great and illustrious day;
26971	44	2	21	 and every one who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.'>
26972	44	2	22	 "Listen, Israelites, to what I say. Jesus, the Nazarene, a man accredited to you  from God by miracles and marvels and signs which God did among you through Him, as you yourselves know, Him--
26973	44	2	23	 delivered up through God's settled purpose and foreknowledge--you by the hands of  Gentiles have nailed to a cross and have put to death.
26974	44	2	24	 But God has raised Him to life, having   terminated the throes of death, for in fact it was not possible for Him to be held fast by death.
26975	44	2	25	 For David says in reference to Him, <"`I constantly fixed my eyes upon the Lord, because He is at my right hand in order that I may continue unshaken.
26976	44	2	26	 For this reason my heart  is glad and my tongue  exults. My body also  shall rest in hope.
26977	44	2	27	 For Thou wilt not leave me in  the Unseen World forsaken, nor give up Thy holy One to undergo  decay.
26978	44	2	28	 Thou hast made known to me the ways of Life: Thou wilt fill me with gladness  in Thy presence.'>
26979	44	2	29	 "As to the patriarch David, I need hardly remind you, brethren, that he died and was buried, and that we still have his tomb among us.
26980	44	2	30	 Being a Prophet, however, and knowing that God had solemnly sworn to him  to seat a descendant of his upon his throne,
26981	44	2	31	 with prophetic foresight he spoke of the resurrection of  the Christ, to the effect that He was not left forsaken in the Unseen World, nor did His body undergo decay.
26982	44	2	32	 This Jesus, God has raised to life--  a fact to which all of us testify.
26983	44	2	33	 "Being therefore lifted high  by the mighty hand of God, He has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out this which you  see and hear.
26984	44	2	34	 For David  did not ascend into Heaven, but he says himself, <"`The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand
26985	44	2	35	 until I make thy foes a footstool under thy feet.'>
26986	44	2	36	 "Therefore let  the whole House of Israel know beyond all doubt that God has made Him both LORD and CHRIST--this Jesus whom you crucified."
26987	44	2	37	  Stung to the heart by these words, they said to Peter and the rest of the Apostles, "Brethren, what are we to do?"
26988	44	2	38	 "Repent," replied Peter, "and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ,  with a view to the remission of your sins, and you shall receive  the gift of the Holy Spirit.
26989	44	2	39	 For to you belongs the promise, and to your children, and to all who are  far off, whoever the Lord our God  may call."
26990	44	2	40	 And with many more appeals he solemnly warned and entreated them, saying,  "Escape from this crooked generation."
26991	44	2	41	 Those, therefore, who joyfully welcomed his Message were baptized; and on that one day about three thousand persons were added to them;
26992	44	2	42	 and they were constant in listening to the teaching of the Apostles and in their attendance at the  Communion, that is, the Breaking of the Bread, and  at prayer.
26993	44	2	43	 Fear came upon every one, and many marvels and signs  were done by the Apostles.
26994	44	2	44	 And all the believers kept together, and had everything in common.
26995	44	2	45	 They sold their  lands and other property, and distributed the proceeds among all, according to every one's necessities.
26996	44	2	46	 And, day by day, attending constantly in the  Temple with one accord, and breaking bread  in private houses, they took their meals with great happiness and single-heartedness,
26997	44	2	47	 praising God and being regarded with favour by all the people. Also, day by day, the Lord added  to their number those  whom He was saving.
26998	44	3	1	 One day Peter and John were going up to the Temple for  the hour of prayer--the ninth hour--and, just then,
26999	44	3	2	 some men were carrying there one who had been lame from birth, whom they were wont  to place every day close to the Beautiful  Gate (as it was called) of the Temple, for him to beg from the people as they went in.
27000	44	3	3	 Seeing Peter and John about to go into the Temple, he asked them for alms.
27001	44	3	4	 Peter fixing his eyes on him, as John did also, said, "Look at us."
27002	44	3	5	 So he looked and waited, expecting to receive something from them.
27003	44	3	6	 "I have no silver or gold," Peter said, "but what I have, I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ, the Nazarene--  walk!"
27004	44	3	7	 Then taking his hand Peter lifted him up, and immediately his  feet and ankles were  strengthened.
27005	44	3	8	 Leaping up, he stood upright and began to walk, and went into the Temple with them, walking, leaping, and praising God.
27006	44	3	9	 All the people saw him walking and praising God;
27007	44	3	10	 and  recognizing him as the man who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple asking for alms, they were filled with awe and amazement at what had happened to him.
27008	44	3	11	 While he still clung to Peter and John, the people, awe-struck, ran up crowding round them in what was known as Solomon's Portico.
27009	44	3	12	 Peter, seeing this,  spoke to the people. "Israelites," he said, "why do you wonder at  this man? Or why gaze at us, as though by any power or piety of our own we had enabled him to walk?
27010	44	3	13	 The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our forefathers, has conferred this honour on His  Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up and disowned in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to let Him go.
27011	44	3	14	 Yes, you disowned the holy and righteous One, and asked as a favour the release of  a murderer.
27012	44	3	15	 The Prince of Life you put to death; but God has raised Him from the dead, and we are witnesses as to that.
27013	44	3	16	 It is His name--  faith in that name being the condition--which has strengthened this man whom you behold and know; and the faith which He has given has made this man sound and strong again,  as you can all see.
27014	44	3	17	 "And now, brethren, I know that it was in ignorance that you did it, as was the case with your rulers also.
27015	44	3	18	 But in this way God has fulfilled the declarations He made through all the Prophets, that His Christ would suffer.
27016	44	3	19	 Repent, therefore, and  reform your lives, so that the record of your sins may be cancelled, and that there may come  seasons of revival from the Lord,
27017	44	3	20	 and that He may send the Christ  appointed beforehand for you--even Jesus.
27018	44	3	21	  Heaven must receive Him until those times of which God has spoken  from the earliest ages through the lips of His holy Prophets--the times of the  reconstitution of all things.
27019	44	3	22	 Moses  declared, <"`The Lord your God will raise up a Prophet for you from among your brethren as He has raised me. In all that He says to you, you must listen to Him.
27020	44	3	23	 And every one, without exception, who refuses to listen to that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the People.'>
27021	44	3	24	  Yes, and all the Prophets, from Samuel onwards--all who have spoken--have also  announced the coming of this present time.
27022	44	3	25	 "You are the  heirs of the Prophets, and of the  Covenant which God made with your forefathers when He said to Abraham, <`And through your posterity all the families of the world shall be blessed.'>
27023	44	3	26	 It is to you first that God, after raising His Servant from the grave, has sent Him to bless you, by causing every one of you to turn from your wickedness."
27024	44	4	1	 While they were saying this to the people, the Priests, the  Commander of the Temple Guard, and the Sadducees came upon them,
27025	44	4	2	 highly incensed at their teaching the people and proclaiming in the case of Jesus the Resurrection from among the dead.
27026	44	4	3	 They arrested the two Apostles and lodged them in custody till the next day; for it was already evening.
27027	44	4	4	 But many of those who had listened to their preaching believed; and the number of the adult men had now grown to be about 5,000.
27028	44	4	5	 The next day a meeting was held in Jerusalem of their Rulers, Elders, and Scribes,
27029	44	4	6	 with  Annas the High Priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and the other members of the high-priestly family.
27030	44	4	7	 So they made the Apostles stand  in the centre, and demanded of them,  "By  what power or  in  what name have you done this?"
27031	44	4	8	 Then Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit, and he replied, "Rulers and Elders of the people,
27032	44	4	9	 if we to-day are under examination concerning  the benefit conferred on a man helplessly lame, as to how  this man  has been cured;
27033	44	4	10	 be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that  through the name of Jesus  the Anointed, the Nazarene, whom *you* crucified, but whom *God* has raised from among the dead--  through that name this man stands here before you in perfect health.
27034	44	4	11	 This Jesus is <the Stone treated with contempt by you the builders, but it has been made the Cornerstone.>
27035	44	4	12	 And in no other is  the great salvation to be found; for, in fact, there is no second name under Heaven that has been given among men through which we are to be saved."
27036	44	4	13	 As they looked on  Peter and John so fearlessly outspoken--and also discovered that they were illiterate persons, untrained in the schools--they were surprised; and  now they recognized them as having been with Jesus.
27037	44	4	14	 And seeing the man standing with them--the man who had been cured--they had no reply to make.
27038	44	4	15	 So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin while they conferred among themselves.
27039	44	4	16	 "What are we to do with these men?" they asked one another; for the fact that a remarkable  miracle has been performed  by them is well known to every one in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.
27040	44	4	17	 But to prevent  the matter spreading any further among the people, let us stop them by threats from speaking in the future  in this name to any one whatever."
27041	44	4	18	 So they recalled the Apostles, and ordered them altogether to give up  speaking or teaching in the name of Jesus.
27042	44	4	19	 But Peter and John replied,  "Judge whether it is right in God's sight to listen to you instead of listening to God.
27043	44	4	20	 As for us, what we have seen and heard we cannot help speaking about."
27044	44	4	21	 The Court added further threats and then let them go, being quite unable to find any way of punishing them on account of the people, because all gave God the glory for the thing that had happened.
27045	44	4	22	 For the man was over forty years of age on whom this miracle of restoration to health had been performed.
27046	44	4	23	 After their release the two Apostles went to their friends, and told them all that the High Priests and Elders had said.
27047	44	4	24	 And they, upon hearing the story,  all lifted up their voices to God and said, "O Sovereign Lord, it is Thou who didst make Heaven and earth and sea, and all that is in them,
27048	44	4	25	 and didst say  through the Holy Spirit by the lips of our forefather David Thy  servant, <"`Why have the nations  stamped and raged, and the peoples formed futile plans?
27049	44	4	26	 The  kings of the  earth came near, and the rulers assembled together against the Lord and against His Anointed.'">
27050	44	4	27	 "They did indeed assemble  in this city in hostility to Thy holy Servant Jesus whom Thou hadst anointed--Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and also the  tribes of Israel--
27051	44	4	28	 to do all that Thy  power and Thy will had predetermined should be done.
27052	44	4	29	 And now, Lord,  listen to their threats, and enable Thy servants to proclaim Thy Message with fearless courage,
27053	44	4	30	  whilst Thou stretchest out Thine arm to cure men, and to give signs and marvels through the name of Thy holy Servant Jesus."
27054	44	4	31	 When they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled shook, and they were, one and all, filled with the Holy Spirit, and proceeded to tell God's Message with boldness.
27055	44	4	32	 Among all those who had embraced the faith there was but one heart and soul, so that none of them claimed any of his possessions as his own, but everything they had was common property;
27056	44	4	33	 while the Apostles with great force of conviction delivered their testimony as to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus; and great grace was upon them all.
27057	44	4	34	 And, in fact, there was not a needy man among them, for  all who were possessors of lands or houses  sold them, and  brought the money which they realised,
27058	44	4	35	 and  gave it to the Apostles, and distribution was made to every one according to his wants.
27059	44	4	36	 In this way Joseph, whom the Apostles gave the name of Bar-nabas--signifying `Son of  Encouragement' --a Levite,  a native of Cyprus,
27060	44	4	37	 sold  a farm which he had, and brought the money and  gave it to the Apostles.
27061	44	5	1	 There was a man of the name of  Ananias who, with his wife Sapphira, sold some property but,
27062	44	5	2	 with her full knowledge and consent,  dishonestly kept back part of the price which he received for it, though he brought the rest and gave it to the Apostles.
27063	44	5	3	 "Ananias," said Peter, "why  has Satan taken possession of your heart, that you should try to deceive the Holy Spirit and dishonestly keep back part of the price paid you for this land?
27064	44	5	4	 While it remained unsold, was not the land your own? And when sold, was it not at your own disposal? How is it that you have  cherished this design in your heart?  It is not to men you have told this lie, but to God."
27065	44	5	5	 Upon hearing these words Ananias fell down dead, and all who heard the words were awe-struck.
27066	44	5	6	 The younger men, however, rose, and wrapping the body up, carried it out and buried it.
27067	44	5	7	 About three hours had passed, when his wife came in, knowing nothing of what had happened.
27068	44	5	8	 Peter at once  questioned her. "Tell me," he said, "whether you sold the land for so much." "Yes," she replied, "for so much."
27069	44	5	9	 "How was it," replied Peter, "that you two agreed  to try an experiment upon the Spirit of the Lord?  The men who have buried your husband are already at the door, and they will carry you out."
27070	44	5	10	 Instantly she fell down dead at his feet, and the young men  came in and found her dead. So they carried her out and buried her by her husband's side.
27071	44	5	11	 This incident struck terror into the whole Church, and into the hearts of all who heard of it.
27072	44	5	12	 Many signs and marvels continued to be done among the people by the Apostles; and by common consent they all met in Solomon's Portico.
27073	44	5	13	 But  none of the others dared to attach themselves to them. Yet the people held them in high honour--
27074	44	5	14	 and more and more believers in the Lord joined them, including great numbers both of men and women--
27075	44	5	15	 so that they  would even bring out  their sick friends into the streets and lay them on light couches or mats, in order that when Peter came by, at least his shadow might fall on one or other of them.
27076	44	5	16	 The inhabitants, too, of the towns in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem  came in crowds, bringing sick persons and some who were harassed by foul spirits, and they were cured, one and all.
27077	44	5	17	 This roused the High Priest. He and all his party--the sect of the Sadducees--were filled with angry jealousy
27078	44	5	18	 and laid hands upon the Apostles, and put them into the public jail.
27079	44	5	19	 But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said,
27080	44	5	20	 "Go and stand in the Temple, and go on proclaiming to the people all  this Message of Life."
27081	44	5	21	 Having received that command they went into the Temple, just before daybreak, and began to teach: So when the High Priest and his party came, and had called together the Sanhedrin as well as all the  Elders of the  descendants of Israel, they sent to the jail to fetch the Apostles.
27082	44	5	22	 But the officers went and could not find them in the prison. So they came back and brought word,
27083	44	5	23	 saying, "The jail we found quite safely locked, and the warders were on guard at the doors, but  upon going in we found no one there."
27084	44	5	24	 When the Commander of the Temple Guards and the High Priests heard this statement, they were utterly at a loss with regard to it, wondering what would happen next.
27085	44	5	25	 And some one came and brought them word, saying,  "The men you put in prison are actually in the Temple, standing there, teaching the people."
27086	44	5	26	 Upon this the Commander went with the officers, and brought the Apostles; but without using violence; for they were afraid of being stoned by the people.
27087	44	5	27	 So they brought them and made them stand  in front of the Sanhedrin. And then the High Priest questioned them.
27088	44	5	28	 "We strictly forbad you to teach in that name--did we not?" he said. "And see, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and are trying to make us responsible for that man's death!"
27089	44	5	29	 Peter and the other Apostles replied, "We must obey God rather than man.
27090	44	5	30	 The God of our forefathers has  raised Jesus to life, whom you crucified and put to death.
27091	44	5	31	 God has exalted Him  to His right hand as Chief Leader and as Saviour, to give Israel repentance and forgiveness of sins.
27092	44	5	32	 And we--and the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him--are witnesses as to these things."
27093	44	5	33	  Infuriated at getting this answer, they  were disposed to kill the Apostles.
27094	44	5	34	 But a Pharisee of the name of Gamaliel, a teacher of the Law, held in honour by all the people, rose from his seat and requested that  they should be sent outside the court for a few minutes.
27095	44	5	35	 "Israelites," he said, "be careful what you are about to do in dealing with these men.
27096	44	5	36	 Years ago Theudas appeared, professing to be a person of importance, and a body of men, some four hundred in number, joined him. He was killed, and all his followers were dispersed and annihilated.
27097	44	5	37	 After him, at the time of the Census, came Judas, the Galilaean, and was the leader in a revolt. He too perished, and all his followers were scattered.
27098	44	5	38	 And now I tell you to hold aloof from these men and leave them alone--for if this scheme or work is of human origin, it will come to nothing.
27099	44	5	39	 But if it is really from God, you will be powerless to put them down--lest perhaps you find yourselves to be actually fighting against God."
27100	44	5	40	 His advice carried conviction. So they called the Apostles in, and--after  flogging them--ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and then let them go.
27101	44	5	41	 They, therefore,  left the Sanhedrin and went their way,  rejoicing that they had been deemed worthy to suffer disgrace on behalf of  the NAME.
27102	44	5	42	 But they did not desist from teaching every day, in the Temple or in private houses, and telling the Good News about Jesus, the Christ.
27103	44	6	1	 About this time, as the number of disciples was increasing, complaints were made by  the Greek-speaking Jews against the  Hebrews because their widows were habitually overlooked in the daily  ministration.
27104	44	6	2	 So the Twelve called together the general body of the disciples and said, "It does not seem  fitting that  we Apostles should neglect the delivery of God's Message and  minister at tables.
27105	44	6	3	 Therefore, brethren, pick out from among yourselves seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, and we will appoint them to undertake this duty.
27106	44	6	4	 But, as for us, we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the  delivery of the Message."
27107	44	6	5	 The suggestion met with general approval, and they selected Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch.
27108	44	6	6	 These men they brought to the Apostles, and, after prayer, they laid their hands upon them.
27109	44	6	7	 Meanwhile God's Message continued to spread, and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem very greatly increased, and  very many priests obeyed the faith.
27110	44	6	8	 And Stephen, full of grace and power, performed great marvels and signs among the people.
27111	44	6	9	 But some members of the so-called `Synagogue of the Freed-men,' together with some Cyrenaeans, Alexandrians, Cilicians and  men from Roman Asia, were roused to encounter Stephen in debate.
27112	44	6	10	 They were quite unable, however, to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke.
27113	44	6	11	 Then they privately put forward men who declared, "We have heard him speak blasphemous things against Moses and against God."
27114	44	6	12	 In this way they excited the people, the Elders, and the Scribes. At length they came upon him, seized him with violence, and took him  before the Sanhedrin.
27115	44	6	13	 Here they brought forward false witnesses who declared, "This fellow is incessantly speaking against the Holy Place and the Law.
27116	44	6	14	 For we have heard him say that Jesus, the Nazarene, will pull  this place down to the ground and will change the customs which Moses handed down to us."
27117	44	6	15	 At once the eyes of all who were sitting in the Sanhedrin were fastened on him, and they saw his face looking just like the face of an angel.
27118	44	7	1	 Then the High Priest asked him, "Are these statements true?"
27119	44	7	2	 The reply of Stephen was, "Sirs--brethren and fathers--listen to me.  God Most Glorious appeared to our forefather Abraham when he was living in Mesopotamia, before he settled in Haran,
27120	44	7	3	 and said to him, "`Leave your country and your relatives, and go into whatever land I point out to you.'
27121	44	7	4	 "Thereupon he left Chaldaea and settled in Haran till after the death of his father, when God caused him to remove into this country where  you now live.
27122	44	7	5	 But he gave him no inheritance in it, no, not a single  square yard of ground. And yet He promised to bestow the land as a permanent possession on him and his posterity after him--and promised this at a time when Abraham was childless.
27123	44	7	6	 And God declared that Abraham's posterity should for four hundred years make their home in a country not their own, and be reduced to slavery and be oppressed.
27124	44	7	7	 "`And the nation, whichever it is, that enslaves them, I will judge,' said God; `and afterwards they shall come out, and they shall worship Me in this place.'
27125	44	7	8	 "Then He gave him the Covenant of circumcision, and under this Covenant he became the father of Isaac--whom he circumcised on the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve Patriarchs.
27126	44	7	9	 "The Patriarchs were jealous of Joseph and sold him into slavery in Egypt. But God was with him
27127	44	7	10	 and delivered him from all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him governor over Egypt and all the royal household.
27128	44	7	11	 But there came a famine throughout the whole of Egypt and Canaan--and great distress--so that our forefathers could find no food.
27129	44	7	12	 When, however, Jacob heard that there was wheat to be had, he sent our forefathers into Egypt; that was the first time.
27130	44	7	13	 On their second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Pharaoh was informed of Joseph's parentage.
27131	44	7	14	 Then Joseph sent and invited his father Jacob and all his family, numbering  seventy-five persons, to come to him,
27132	44	7	15	 and Jacob went down into Egypt. There he died, and so did our forefathers,
27133	44	7	16	 and they were taken to  Shechem and were laid in the tomb which  Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a sum of money paid in silver.
27134	44	7	17	 "But as the time drew near for the fulfilment of the promise which God had made to Abraham, the people became many times more numerous in Egypt,
27135	44	7	18	 until there arose a foreign king over Egypt who knew nothing of Joseph.
27136	44	7	19	 He adopted a crafty policy towards our race, and oppressed our forefathers, making them cast out their infants so that they might not  be permitted to live.
27137	44	7	20	 At this time Moses was born--a  wonderfully beautiful child; and for three months he was cared for in his father's house.
27138	44	7	21	 At length he was cast out, but Pharaoh's daughter adopted him, and brought him up as her own son.
27139	44	7	22	 So Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians, and possessed great influence through his eloquence and his achievements.
27140	44	7	23	 "And when he was just forty years old, it occurred to him to visit his brethren the descendants of Israel.
27141	44	7	24	 Seeing one of them wrongfully treated he took his part, and secured justice for the ill-treated man by striking down the Egyptian.
27142	44	7	25	 He supposed his brethren to be aware that by him God was sending them deliverance; this, however, they did not understand.
27143	44	7	26	 The next day, also, he came and found two of them fighting, and he endeavoured to make peace between them. "`Sirs,' he said, `you are brothers. Why are you wronging one another?'
27144	44	7	27	 "But the man who was doing the wrong  resented his interference, and asked, "`Who appointed you magistrate and judge over us?
27145	44	7	28	 Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'
27146	44	7	29	 "Alarmed at this question, Moses fled from the country and went to live in the land of Midian. There he became the father of two sons.
27147	44	7	30	 "But at the end of forty years there appeared to him in the Desert of Mount Sinai an angel in the middle of a flame of fire in a bush.
27148	44	7	31	 When Moses saw this he wondered at the sight; but on his going up to look further, the voice of the Lord was heard, saying,
27149	44	7	32	 "`I am the God of your forefathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob.' "Quaking with fear Moses did not dare gaze.
27150	44	7	33	 "`Take off your shoes,' said the Lord, `for the spot on which you are standing is holy ground.
27151	44	7	34	 I have seen, yes, I have seen the oppression of My people who are in Egypt and have heard their groans, and I have come down to deliver them. And now  I will send you to Egypt.'
27152	44	7	35	 "The Moses whom they rejected, asking him, `Who appointed you magistrate and judge?' --that same Moses  we find God sending as a magistrate and a  deliverer by the help of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
27153	44	7	36	 This was he who brought them out,  after performing marvels and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea, and in the Desert for forty years.
27154	44	7	37	 This is the Moses who said to the descendants of Israel, <"`God will raise up a Prophet for you, from among your brethren, just as He raised me up.'>
27155	44	7	38	 `This is he who was among the  Congregation in the Desert, together with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai and with our forefathers, who received  ever-living  utterances to hand on  to us.
27156	44	7	39	 "Our forefathers, however, would not submit to him, but spurned his authority and in their hearts turned back to Egypt.
27157	44	7	40	 They said to Aaron, "`Make  gods for us, to march in front of us; for as for this Moses who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'
27158	44	7	41	 "Moreover they made a calf at that time, and offered a sacrifice to the idol and kept rejoicing in the gods which their own hands had made.
27159	44	7	42	 So God turned from them and gave them up to the worship of the Host of Heaven, as it is written in the Book of the Prophets, <"'Were they victims and sacrifices which you  offered Me, forty years in the Desert, O House of Israel?
27160	44	7	43	  Yes, you  lifted up  Moloch's tent and the Star of the God Rephan--the images which you made in order to worship them; and I will remove you beyond Babylon.'>
27161	44	7	44	 "Our forefathers had  the Tent of the Testimony in the Desert, built as He who spoke to Moses had instructed him to make it in imitation of the model which he had seen.
27162	44	7	45	 That Tent was bequeathed to the next generation of our forefathers. Under Joshua they brought it with them when they were taking possession of the land of the Gentile nations, whom God drove out before them. So it continued till David's time.
27163	44	7	46	 David obtained favour with God, and asked leave to provide a dwelling-place for the God of Jacob.
27164	44	7	47	 But it was Solomon who built a house for Him.
27165	44	7	48	 Yet the Most High does not dwell in buildings erected by men's hands. But, as the Prophet declares,
27166	44	7	49	 <"`The sky is My throne, and earth is the footstool for My feet. What kind of house will you build for Me, says the Lord, or what resting place shall I have?
27167	44	7	50	 Did not My hand form this universe.'>
27168	44	7	51	 "O stiff-necked men, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you also are continually  at strife with the Holy Spirit--just as your forefathers were.
27169	44	7	52	 Which of the Prophets did not your forefathers persecute? Yes, they killed those who announced beforehand the advent of the righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become--
27170	44	7	53	 you who received the Law  given through angels, and yet have not obeyed it."
27171	44	7	54	 As they listened to these words, they became infuriated and gnashed their teeth at him.
27172	44	7	55	 But,  full of the Holy Spirit and looking up to Heaven,  Stephen  saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at God's right hand.
27173	44	7	56	  "I can see Heaven wide open," he said, "and the Son of Man standing at God's right hand."
27174	44	7	57	 Upon this, with a loud outcry they stopped their ears, rushed upon Stephen in a body,
27175	44	7	58	 dragged him out of the city, and  stoned him, the witnesses throwing off their outer garments and giving them into the care of a young man called Saul.
27176	44	7	59	 So they  stoned Stephen,  while he prayed,  "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
27177	44	7	60	 Then, rising on his knees, he cried aloud,  "Lord, do not reckon this sin against them." And with these words he fell asleep.
27178	44	8	1	 And Saul fully approved of his murder. At this time a great persecution broke out against the Church in Jerusalem, and  all except the Apostles were scattered throughout Judaea and Samaria.
27179	44	8	2	 A party of  devout men, however,  buried Stephen, and made loud lamentation over him.
27180	44	8	3	 But Saul cruelly harassed the Church. He went into house after house, and, dragging off both men and women, threw them into prison.
27181	44	8	4	 Those, however, who were scattered abroad went from place to place spreading the Good News of God's Message;
27182	44	8	5	 while Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed Christ there.
27183	44	8	6	 Crowds of people, with one accord, gave attention to what they heard from him, listening, and witnessing the signs which he did.
27184	44	8	7	 For, with a loud cry, foul spirits came out of many possessed by them, and many paralytics and lame persons were restored to health.
27185	44	8	8	 And there was great joy in that city.
27186	44	8	9	 Now for some time past there had been a man named Simon living there, who had been practising magic and astonishing  the Samaritans, pretending that he was more than human.
27187	44	8	10	 To him people of all classes paid attention, declaring, "This man is the Power of God, known as the great Power."
27188	44	8	11	 His influence over them arose from their having been, for a long time, bewildered by his sorceries.
27189	44	8	12	 But when Philip began to tell the Good News about the Kingdom of God and about the Name of Jesus Christ, and they embraced the faith, they  were baptized, men and women alike.
27190	44	8	13	 Simon himself also  believed, and after being baptized remained in close attendance on Philip, and was full of amazement at seeing such signs and such great miracles performed.
27191	44	8	14	 When the Apostles in Jerusalem heard that the Samaritans had accepted God's Message, they sent Peter and  John to visit them.
27192	44	8	15	 They, when they came down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit:
27193	44	8	16	 for He had not as yet fallen upon any of them. They  had only been baptized  into the name of the Lord Jesus.
27194	44	8	17	 Then the Apostles  placed their hands upon them, and they  received the Holy Spirit.
27195	44	8	18	 When, however, Simon saw that it was through the laying on of the Apostles' hands that the Spirit was bestowed, he offered them money.
27196	44	8	19	 "Give me too," he said, "that power, so that every one on whom I place my hands will receive the Holy Spirit."
27197	44	8	20	 "Perish your money and yourself," replied Peter, "because you have imagined that you can obtain God's free gift with money!
27198	44	8	21	  No part or lot have you in this  matter, for your heart is not right in God's sight.
27199	44	8	22	  Repent, therefore, of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord,  in the hope that the  purpose which is in your heart may perhaps be forgiven you.
27200	44	8	23	 For I perceive that you  have fallen into the bitterest bondage of unrighteousness."
27201	44	8	24	 "Pray, both of you, to the Lord for me," answered Simon, "that nothing of what you have said may come upon me."
27202	44	8	25	 So the Apostles, after giving a solemn charge and delivering the Lord's Message, travelled back to Jerusalem, making known the Good News also in many of the Samaritan villages.
27203	44	8	26	 And an angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Rise and proceed  south to  the road that runs down from Jerusalem to Gaza,  crossing the Desert."
27204	44	8	27	 Upon this he rose and went. Now,  as it happened, an Ethiopian eunuch who was in a position of high authority with Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, as her treasurer, had visited Jerusalem to worship there,
27205	44	8	28	 and was now on his way home; and as he sat in his chariot he was  reading the Prophet Isaiah.
27206	44	8	29	 Then the Spirit said to Philip, "Go and  enter that chariot."
27207	44	8	30	 So Philip ran up and heard the eunuch reading the Prophet Isaiah.  "Do you understand what you are reading?" he asked.
27208	44	8	31	 "Why, how can I," replied the eunuch, "unless some one explains it to me?" And he earnestly invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
27209	44	8	32	 The passage of Scripture which he was reading was this: <"Like a sheep He was led to slaughter, and just as a lamb before its shearer is dumb so He opened not His mouth.
27210	44	8	33	 In His humiliation justice was denied Him.  Who will make known His posterity? For He is destroyed from among men.">
27211	44	8	34	 "Pray, of whom is the Prophet speaking?" inquired the eunuch; "of himself or of some one else?"
27212	44	8	35	 Then Philip  began to speak, and, commencing with that same portion of Scripture, told him the Good News about Jesus.
27213	44	8	36	 So they proceeded on their way till they came to some water; and the eunuch exclaimed, "See, here is water; what is there to prevent my being baptized?"
27214	44	8	37	  []
27215	44	8	38	 So he stopped the chariot; and both of them--Philip and the eunuch--went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.
27216	44	8	39	 But no sooner had they come up out of the water than  the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again. With a glad heart he resumed his journey;
27217	44	8	40	 but Philip found himself at  Ashdod. Then visiting town after town he everywhere made known the Good News until he reached Caesarea.
27218	44	9	1	 Now Saul, whose every breath was a threat of destruction for the disciples of the Lord,
27219	44	9	2	 went to the High Priest and begged from him letters addressed to the synagogues in Damascus, in order that if he found  any believers there, either men or women, he might bring them in chains to Jerusalem.
27220	44	9	3	 But on the journey, as he was getting near Damascus, suddenly there flashed round him a light from Heaven;
27221	44	9	4	 and falling to the ground he heard a voice which said to him,  "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?"
27222	44	9	5	 "Who art thou, Lord?" he asked. "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting," was the reply.
27223	44	9	6	  "But rise and go to the city, and you will be told what you are to do.
27224	44	9	7	 Meanwhile the men who travelled with Saul were standing dumb with amazement, hearing a  sound, but seeing no one.
27225	44	9	8	 Then he rose from the ground, but when he  had opened his eyes, he could not see, and they led him by the  arm and brought him to Damascus.
27226	44	9	9	 And  for two days he remained without sight, and did not eat or drink anything.
27227	44	9	10	 Now in Damascus there was a disciple of the name of Ananias. The Lord spoke to him in a vision, saying, "Ananias!" "I am here, Lord," he answered.
27228	44	9	11	 "Rise," said the Lord, "and go to Straight Street, and inquire at the house of Judas for a man called Saul, from Tarsus, for he is actually praying.
27229	44	9	12	 He has seen a man called Ananias  come and lay his hands upon him so that he may recover his sight."
27230	44	9	13	 "Lord," answered Ananias, "I have heard about that man from many, and I have heard of the great mischief he has done to Thy  people in Jerusalem;
27231	44	9	14	 and here he is authorized by the High Priests to arrest all who call upon Thy name."
27232	44	9	15	 "Go," replied the Lord; "he is a chosen  instrument of Mine to carry My name  to the Gentiles and to kings and to the descendants of Israel.
27233	44	9	16	 For I will let him know the great sufferings which he must pass through for My sake."
27234	44	9	17	 So Ananias went and entered the house; and, laying his two hands upon Saul, said, "Saul, brother, the Lord--even Jesus who appeared to you on your journey--has sent me, that you may recover your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
27235	44	9	18	 Instantly there dropped from his eyes what seemed to be scales, and he could see once more. Upon this he rose and received baptism;
27236	44	9	19	 after which he took food and regained his strength. Then he remained  some little time with the disciples in Damascus.
27237	44	9	20	 And in the synagogues he began at once to proclaim Jesus as the Son of God;
27238	44	9	21	 and his hearers were all amazed, and began to ask one another, "Is not this the man who in Jerusalem  tried to exterminate those who called upon that Name, and  came here on purpose to carry them off in chains to the High Priests?"
27239	44	9	22	 Saul, however,  gained more and more influence, and as for the Jews living in Damascus, he bewildered them with his proofs that Jesus is the Christ.
27240	44	9	23	  At length the Jews plotted to kill Saul;
27241	44	9	24	 but information of their intention was given to him. They even watched the gates, day and night, in order to murder him;
27242	44	9	25	 but his disciples took him by night and let him down  through the wall, lowering him in a  hamper.
27243	44	9	26	 So he came to Jerusalem and made several attempts to associate with the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, being in doubt as to whether he himself was a disciple.
27244	44	9	27	 Barnabas, however, came to his assistance. He brought Saul to the Apostles, and related to them how, on his journey, he had seen the Lord, and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had fearlessly taught in the name of Jesus.
27245	44	9	28	 Henceforth Saul was one of them, going in and out of the city,
27246	44	9	29	 and speaking fearlessly in the name of the Lord. And he often talked with the Hellenists and had discussions with them.
27247	44	9	30	 But they kept trying to take his life. On learning this, the brethren brought him down to Caesarea, and then  sent him by sea to Tarsus.
27248	44	9	31	 The Church, however, throughout the whole of Judaea, Galilee and Samaria, had peace and was spiritually built up; and grew in numbers,  living in the fear of the Lord and  receiving  encouragement from the Holy Spirit.
27249	44	9	32	 Now Peter, as he went to town after town, came down also to  God's people at Lud.
27250	44	9	33	 There he found a man of the name of Aeneas, who for eight years had kept his  bed, through being paralysed.
27251	44	9	34	 Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ cures you. Rise and  make your own bed." He at once rose to his feet.
27252	44	9	35	 And all the people of Lud and Sharon saw him; and they turned to the Lord.
27253	44	9	36	 Among the disciples at  Jaffa was a woman called Tabitha, or, as the name may be translated,  `Dorcas.'  Her life was wholly devoted to the good and charitable actions which she was constantly doing.
27254	44	9	37	 But, as it happened, just at that time she was taken ill and died. After washing her body they laid it out in a room upstairs.
27255	44	9	38	 Lud, however, being near Jaffa, the disciples, who had heard that Peter was at Lud, sent two men to him with an urgent request that he would come across to them without delay.
27256	44	9	39	 So Peter rose and went with them. On his arrival they took him upstairs, and the widow women all came and stood by his side, weeping and showing him the underclothing and cloaks and garments of all kinds which Dorcas used to make while she was still with them.
27257	44	9	40	 Peter, however, putting every one out of the room, knelt down and prayed, and then turning to the body, he said, "Tabitha, rise." Dorcas at once opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, sat up.
27258	44	9	41	 Then, giving her his hand, he raised her to her feet and, calling to him God's people and the widows, he  gave her back to them alive.
27259	44	9	42	 This incident became known throughout Jaffa, and many  believed in the Lord;
27260	44	9	43	 and Peter remained for a considerable time at Jaffa, staying at the house of a man called Simon, a tanner.
27261	44	10	1	 Now a Captain of the Italian Regiment, named Cornelius, was quartered at Caesarea.
27262	44	10	2	 He was religious and God-fearing--and so was every member of his household. He was also liberal in his charities to the people, and continually offered prayer to God.
27263	44	10	3	 About three o'clock one afternoon he had a vision, and distinctly saw an angel of God  enter  his house, who called him by name, saying, "Cornelius!"
27264	44	10	4	 Looking steadily at him, and being much alarmed, he said,  "What do you want, Sir?" "Your prayers and charities," he replied, "have gone up and have been recorded before God.
27265	44	10	5	 And now send to Jaffa and fetch Simon, surnamed Peter.
27266	44	10	6	 He is staying as a guest with Simon, a tanner, who has a house close to the sea."
27267	44	10	7	 So when the angel who had been speaking to him was gone, Cornelius called two of his  servants and a God-fearing soldier who was in constant attendance on him,
27268	44	10	8	 and, after telling them everything, he sent them to Jaffa.
27269	44	10	9	 The next day, while they were still on their journey and were getting near the town, about noon Peter went up on the house-top to pray.
27270	44	10	10	 He had become unusually hungry and wished for food; but, while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance.
27271	44	10	11	 The sky had opened to his view, and what seemed to be an enormous sail was descending, being let down to the earth by ropes at the four corners.
27272	44	10	12	 In it were  all kinds of quadrupeds, reptiles and birds,
27273	44	10	13	 and a voice came to him which said, "Rise, Peter, kill and eat."
27274	44	10	14	 "On no account, Lord," he replied; "for I have never yet eaten anything unholy and impure."
27275	44	10	15	 Again a second time a voice was heard which said, "What God has purified, you must not regard as unholy."
27276	44	10	16	 This  was said three times, and immediately the sail was drawn up  out of sight.
27277	44	10	17	 While Peter was greatly perplexed as to the meaning of the vision which he had seen, just then the men sent by Cornelius, having by inquiry found out Simon's house,
27278	44	10	18	 had come to the door and had called the servant, and were asking, "Is Simon, surnamed Peter, staying here?"
27279	44	10	19	 And Peter was still earnestly thinking over the vision, when the Spirit said to him,  "Three men are now inquiring for you.
27280	44	10	20	 Rise, go down, and go with them without any misgivings; for it is I who have sent them to you."
27281	44	10	21	 So Peter went down and said to the men, "I am the Simon you are inquiring for. What is the reason of your coming?"
27282	44	10	22	 Their reply was, "Cornelius, a Captain, an upright and God-fearing man, of whom the whole Jewish nation speaks well, has been divinely instructed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and listen to what you have to say."
27283	44	10	23	 Upon hearing this, Peter invited them in, and gave them a lodging. The next day he set out with them, some of the brethren from Jaffa going with him,
27284	44	10	24	 and the day after that they reached Caesarea. There Cornelius was awaiting their arrival, and had invited all his relatives and intimate friends to be present.
27285	44	10	25	 When Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him, and threw himself at his feet to do him homage.
27286	44	10	26	 But Peter lifted him up. "Stand up," he said; "I myself also am but a man."
27287	44	10	27	 So Peter went in and conversed with him, and found a large company assembled.
27288	44	10	28	 He said to them,  "You know better than most that a Jew  is strictly forbidden to associate with a Gentile or visit him; but God has taught me to call no one unholy or unclean.
27289	44	10	29	 So for this reason, when sent for, I came without raising any objection. I therefore ask why you sent for me."
27290	44	10	30	 "Just at this hour,  three days ago," replied Cornelius, "I was offering afternoon prayer in my house, when suddenly a man in shining raiment stood in front of me,
27291	44	10	31	 who said, "`Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your charities have been put on record before God.
27292	44	10	32	 Send therefore to Jaffa, and invite Simon, surnamed Peter, to come here. He is staying as a guest in the house of Simon, a tanner, close to the sea.'
27293	44	10	33	 "Immediately, therefore, I sent to you, and  I thank you heartily for having come. That is why all of us are now assembled here in God's presence, to listen to what the Lord has commanded you to say."
27294	44	10	34	 Then Peter began to speak. "I clearly see," he said, "that  God makes no distinctions between one man and another;
27295	44	10	35	 but that in every nation those who fear Him and live good lives are acceptable to Him.
27296	44	10	36	 The Message which He sent to the descendants of Israel, when He announced the Good News of peace through Jesus Christ--He is Lord of all--that Message  you cannot but know;
27297	44	10	37	 the story, I mean, which has spread through the length and breadth of Judaea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism which John proclaimed.
27298	44	10	38	 It tells how God  anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the  Holy Spirit and with power, so that He went about everywhere doing acts of kindness, and curing all who were being continually oppressed by the Devil--for God was with Jesus.
27299	44	10	39	 "And we are witnesses as to all that He did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. But they even put Him to death,  by crucifixion.
27300	44	10	40	 That same Jesus God raised to life on the third day, and permitted Him to appear unmistakably,
27301	44	10	41	 not to all the people, but to witnesses--men previously chosen by God--namely, to us, who ate and drank with Him after He rose from the dead.
27302	44	10	42	 And He has commanded us to preach to the people and solemnly declare that this is He who has been appointed by God to be the Judge of  the living and the dead.
27303	44	10	43	 To Him all the Prophets bear witness, and testify that through His name all who  believe in Him receive the forgiveness of their sins."
27304	44	10	44	 While Peter  was speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to the Message.
27305	44	10	45	 And all the  Jewish believers who had come with Peter were astonished that on the Gentiles also the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out.
27306	44	10	46	 For they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling the majesty of God. Then Peter  said,
27307	44	10	47	 "Can any one forbid the use of water, and object to these persons being baptized--men who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did?"
27308	44	10	48	 And  he directed  that they should be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they begged him to remain with them for a time.
27309	44	11	1	 Now the Apostles, and the brethren  in various parts of Judaea, heard that the Gentiles also had received God's Message;
27310	44	11	2	 and, when Peter returned to Jerusalem, the champions of circumcision found fault with him.
27311	44	11	3	 "You went into the houses of men who are not Jews," they said, "and you ate with them."
27312	44	11	4	 Peter, however, explained the whole matter to them from the beginning.
27313	44	11	5	 "While I was in the town of Jaffa, offering prayer," he said, "in a trance I saw a vision. There descended what seemed to be an enormous sail, being let down from the sky by ropes at the four corners, and it came close to me.
27314	44	11	6	 Fixing my eyes on it, I examined it closely, and saw various kinds of quadrupeds, wild beasts, reptiles and birds.
27315	44	11	7	 I also heard a voice saying to me, "`Rise, Peter, kill and eat.'
27316	44	11	8	 "`On no account, Lord,' I replied, `for nothing unholy or impure has ever gone into my mouth.'
27317	44	11	9	 "But a voice answered, speaking a second time from the sky, "`What God has purified, you must not regard as unholy.'
27318	44	11	10	 "This was said three times, and then everything was drawn up again out of sight.
27319	44	11	11	 "Now at that very moment three men came to the house where we were, having been sent from Caesarea to find me.
27320	44	11	12	 And the Spirit told me to accompany them  without any misgivings. There also went with me these six brethren who are now present, and we reached the  Centurion's house.
27321	44	11	13	 Then he described to us how he had seen  the angel come and  enter his house and say, "`Send to Jaffa and fetch Simon, surnamed Peter.
27322	44	11	14	 He will teach you truths by which you and all your family will be saved.'"
27323	44	11	15	 "And," said Peter, "no sooner had I begun to speak than the Holy Spirit fell upon them, just as He fell upon us at the first.
27324	44	11	16	 Then I remembered the Lord's words, how He used to say, "`John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit.'
27325	44	11	17	 "If therefore God gave them the  same gift as He gave us when we  first believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, why, who was I to be able to thwart God?"
27326	44	11	18	 This statement of Peter's silenced his opponents. They extolled the goodness of God, and said, "So, then, to the Gentiles also God has given the repentance which leads to Life."
27327	44	11	19	 Those, however, who had been driven in various directions by the persecution which broke out on account of Stephen made their way to Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, delivering the Message to none but Jews.
27328	44	11	20	 But some of them were Cyprians and Cyrenaeans, who, on coming to Antioch, spoke to the  Greeks also and told them the Good News concerning the Lord Jesus.
27329	44	11	21	 The  power of the Lord was with them, and there were a vast number who believed and turned to the Lord.
27330	44	11	22	 When tidings of this reached the ears of the Church in Jerusalem, they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch.
27331	44	11	23	 On getting there he was delighted to see the grace which God had bestowed; and he  encouraged them all to remain, with fixed resolve, faithful to the Lord.
27332	44	11	24	 For he was a good man, and was full of the Holy Spirit and of faith; and the number of believers in the Lord greatly increased.
27333	44	11	25	 Then Barnabas paid a visit to Tarsus to try to find Saul.
27334	44	11	26	 He succeeded, and brought him to Antioch; and for a whole year they attended the meetings of the Church, and taught a large number of people. And it was in Antioch that the disciples first received the name of `Christians.'
27335	44	11	27	 At  that time certain Prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch,
27336	44	11	28	 one of whom, named Agabus, being instructed by the Spirit,  publicly predicted the speedy coming of a great famine throughout the world. (It came in the reign of Claudius.)
27337	44	11	29	 So the disciples decided to send relief, every one in proportion to his means, to the brethren living in Judaea.
27338	44	11	30	 This they did, forwarding their contributions to the  Elders by Barnabas and Saul.
27339	44	12	1	 Now, about that time, King Herod arrested certain members of the Church, in order to ill-treat them;
27340	44	12	2	 and James, John's brother, he beheaded.
27341	44	12	3	 Finding that this gratified the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also; these being the days of Unleavened Bread.
27342	44	12	4	 He had him arrested and lodged in jail, handing him over to the care of  sixteen soldiers; and intended after the Passover to bring him out again to the people.
27343	44	12	5	 So Peter was kept in prison; but long and fervent prayer was offered to God by the Church on his behalf.
27344	44	12	6	 Now when Herod was on the point of taking him out of prison, that very night Peter was asleep between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and  guards were  on duty outside the door.
27345	44	12	7	 Suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell; and, striking Peter on the side, he woke him and said, "Rise quickly." Instantly the chains dropped off his wrists.
27346	44	12	8	 "Fasten your girdle," said the angel, "and tie on your sandals." He did so. Then the angel said, "Throw your cloak round you, and follow me."
27347	44	12	9	 So Peter went out, following him, yet could not believe that what the angel was doing was real, but supposed that he saw a vision.
27348	44	12	10	 And passing through  the first ward and the second, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. This opened to them of itself; and, going out, they passed on through one of the streets, and then suddenly the angel left him.
27349	44	12	11	 Peter coming to himself said, "Now I know for certain that the Lord has sent His angel and has rescued me from the power of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were anticipating."
27350	44	12	12	 So, after thinking things over, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John surnamed Mark, where a large number of people were assembled, praying.
27351	44	12	13	 When he knocked at the  wicket in the door, a maidservant named  Rhoda came to answer the knock;
27352	44	12	14	 and recognizing Peter's voice, for very joy she did not open the door, but ran in and told them that Peter was standing there.
27353	44	12	15	 "You are mad," they said. But she strenuously maintained that it was true. "It is his  guardian angel," they said.
27354	44	12	16	 Meanwhile Peter went on knocking, until at last they opened the door and saw that it was really he, and were filled with amazement.
27355	44	12	17	 But he motioned with his hand for silence, and then described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. "Tell all this to James and the brethren," he added. Then he left them, and went to another place.
27356	44	12	18	 When morning came, there was no little commotion among the soldiers, as to what could possibly have become of Peter.
27357	44	12	19	 And when Herod had had him searched for and could not find him, after sharply questioning the guards he ordered them away to execution. He then went down from Judaea to Caesarea and remained there.
27358	44	12	20	 Now the people of Tyre and Sidon had incurred Herod's violent displeasure. So they sent a large deputation to wait on him; and having secured the good will of Blastus, his treasurer, they begged the king  to be friendly with them again, because their country was dependent on his for its food supply.
27359	44	12	21	 So, on an appointed day, Herod, having arrayed himself in royal robes, took his seat on the tribunal, and was haranguing them;
27360	44	12	22	 and the assembled people kept shouting, "It is the voice of a god, and not of a man!"
27361	44	12	23	 Instantly an angel of the Lord struck him, because he had not given the glory to God, and being eaten up by worms, he  died.
27362	44	12	24	 But God's Message prospered, and converts were multiplied.
27363	44	12	25	 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having discharged their mission, and they brought with them John, surnamed Mark.
27364	44	13	1	 Now there were in Antioch,  in the Church there--as Prophets and teachers--barnabas,  Symeon surnamed `the black,' Lucius the Cyrenaean, Manaen  (who was Herod the Tetrarch's foster-brother), and Saul.
27365	44	13	2	 While they were worshipping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for Me, now at once, Barnabas and Saul, for the work to which I have called them."
27366	44	13	3	 So, after fasting and prayer and the laying on of hands, they let them go.
27367	44	13	4	 They therefore, being thus sent out by the Holy Spirit, went  down to Seleuceia, and from there sailed to Cyprus.
27368	44	13	5	 Having reached Salamis, they began to announce God's Message in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John as their  assistant.
27369	44	13	6	 When they had gone through the whole length of the island as far as Paphos, they there met with a Jewish magician and false prophet,  Bar-Jesus by name,
27370	44	13	7	 who was a friend of the Proconsul Sergius Paulus. The Proconsul was a man of keen intelligence. He sent for Barnabas and Saul, and asked to be told God's Message.
27371	44	13	8	 But  Elymas (or `the Magician,' for such is the meaning of the name) opposed them, and tried to  prevent the Proconsul from accepting the faith.
27372	44	13	9	 Then Saul, who is also called Paul, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and, fixing his eyes on Elymas,
27373	44	13	10	 said, "You who are full of every kind of craftiness and unscrupulous cunning--you son of the Devil and foe to all that is right--will you never cease  to misrepresent the straight paths of the Lord?
27374	44	13	11	 The Lord's hand is now upon you, and you will be blind for a time and unable to see the light of day." Instantly there fell upon him a mist and a darkness, and, as he walked about, he begged people to lead him  by the hand.
27375	44	13	12	 Then the Proconsul, seeing what had happened, believed, being struck with amazement at  the teaching of the Lord.
27376	44	13	13	 From Paphos, Paul and his party put out to sea and sailed to Perga in Pamphylia. John, however, left them and returned to Jerusalem.
27377	44	13	14	 But they themselves, passing through from Perga, came to Antioch in Pisidia. Here, on the Sabbath day, they went into the synagogue and sat down.
27378	44	13	15	 After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the Wardens of the synagogue sent word to them. "Brethren," they said, "if you have anything encouraging to say to the people, speak."
27379	44	13	16	 So Paul rose, and motioning with his hand for silence, said, "Israelites, and you others who fear God, pay attention to me.
27380	44	13	17	 The God of this people of Israel chose our forefathers, and made the people great during their stay in Egypt, until with  wondrous power He brought them out from that land.
27381	44	13	18	 For a period of about forty years, He  fed them, like a nurse, in the Desert.
27382	44	13	19	 Then, after overthrowing seven nations in the land of Canaan, He divided that country among them as their inheritance for about four hundred and fifty years;
27383	44	13	20	 and afterwards He gave them judges down to the time of the Prophet Samuel.
27384	44	13	21	 Next they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a Benjamite, who reigned forty years.
27385	44	13	22	 After removing him, He raised up David to be their king, to whom He also bore witness when He said, "`I have found David the son of Jesse, a man I love, who will obey all My commands.'
27386	44	13	23	 "It is from among David's descendants that God, in fulfilment of His promise, has raised up a Saviour for Israel, even Jesus.
27387	44	13	24	 Before the coming of Jesus, John had proclaimed to all the people of Israel a baptism of repentance.
27388	44	13	25	 But John, towards the end of his career, repeatedly asked the people, "`What do you suppose me to be? I am not the Christ. But there is One coming after me whose sandal I am not worthy to unfasten.'
27389	44	13	26	 "Brethren, descendants of the family of Abraham, and all among you who fear God, to us has this Message of salvation been sent.
27390	44	13	27	 For the people of Jerusalem and their rulers,  by the judgement they pronounced on Jesus, have actually fulfilled the predictions of the Prophets which are read Sabbath after Sabbath, through ignorance of those predictions and of Him.
27391	44	13	28	 Without having found Him guilty of any capital offence they urged Pilate to have Him put to death;
27392	44	13	29	 and when they had carried out everything which had been written about Him, they took Him down from the  cross and laid Him in a tomb.
27393	44	13	30	 "But God raised Him from the dead.
27394	44	13	31	 And, after a few days, He appeared to the people who had gone up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem and are now witnesses concerning Him to the Jews.
27395	44	13	32	 And we bring you the Good News about the promise made to our forefathers,
27396	44	13	33	 that God has amply fulfilled it to our children in  raising up Jesus; as it is also written in  the second Psalm, <`Thou art My Son: to-day I have become Thy Father.'>
27397	44	13	34	 And as to His having raised Him from among the dead, never again to be in the position of one soon to return to decay, He  speaks thus: <`I will give you the holy and trustworthy promises made to David.'>
27398	44	13	35	 Because in another Psalm also He says, <`Thou wilt not  give up Thy Holy One to undergo decay.'>
27399	44	13	36	 For David,  after having been useful to his own generation in accordance with God's purpose, did fall asleep, was gathered to his forefathers, and did undergo decay.
27400	44	13	37	 But He whom God raised to life underwent no decay.
27401	44	13	38	 "Understand therefore, brethren, that through this Jesus forgiveness of sins is announced to you;
27402	44	13	39	 and in Him every believer is absolved from all offences, from which you could not be absolved under the Law of Moses.
27403	44	13	40	 Beware, then, lest what is spoken in the Prophets should come true of you:
27404	44	13	41	 <`Behold, you despisers, be astonished and perish, because I am carrying on a work in your time--a work which you will utterly refuse to believe, though it be fully declared to you.'">
27405	44	13	42	 As  Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people earnestly begged to have all this repeated to them on the following Sabbath.
27406	44	13	43	 And, when the congregation had broken up, many of the Jews and of the devout converts from heathenism continued with Paul and Barnabas, who talked to them and urged them to hold fast to the grace of God.
27407	44	13	44	 On the next Sabbath almost the whole population of the city came together to hear the Lord's Message.
27408	44	13	45	 Seeing the crowds, the Jews, filled with angry jealousy, opposed Paul's statements and abused him.
27409	44	13	46	 Then, throwing off all reserve, Paul and Barnabas said, "We were bound to proclaim God's Message to you first. But since you spurn it and judge yourselves to be unworthy of the Life  of the Ages--well, we turn to the Gentiles.
27410	44	13	47	 For such is the Lord's command to us. <"`I have placed Thee,'> He says of Christ, <`as a light to the Gentiles, in order that Thou mayest be a Saviour as far as the remotest parts of the earth.'">
27411	44	13	48	 The Gentiles listened with delight and extolled the Lord's Message; and all who were pre-destined to the Life of the Ages believed.
27412	44	13	49	 So the Lord's Message spread through the whole district.
27413	44	13	50	 But the Jews influenced the gentlewomen of rank who worshipped with them, and also the leading men in the city, and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and drove them out of the district.
27414	44	13	51	 But they shook off the dust from their feet as a protest against them and came to Iconium;
27415	44	13	52	 and as for the disciples, they were  more and more filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
27416	44	14	1	 At Iconium the Apostles went  together to the Jewish synagogue and preached, with the result that a great number both of Jews and Greeks believed.
27417	44	14	2	 But the Jews who  had refused  obedience stirred up the Gentiles and embittered their minds against the brethren.
27418	44	14	3	 Yet Paul and Barnabas remained there for a considerable time, speaking freely and relying on the Lord, while He bore witness to the Message of His grace by permitting signs and marvels to be done by them.
27419	44	14	4	 At length the people of the city  split into parties, some siding with the Jews and some with the Apostles.
27420	44	14	5	 And when a hostile movement was made by both Gentiles and Jews, with the sanction of their magistrates, to maltreat and stone them,
27421	44	14	6	 the Apostles, having become aware of it, made their escape into the Lycaonian towns of Lystra and Derbe, and the neighbouring country.
27422	44	14	7	 And there they continued to tell the Good News.
27423	44	14	8	 Now a man who had no power in his feet used to sit in the streets of Lystra. He had been lame from his birth and  had never walked.
27424	44	14	9	  After this man had listened to one of Paul's sermons, the Apostle, looking steadily at him and perceiving that he had faith to be cured,
27425	44	14	10	 said in a loud voice, "Stand upright upon your feet!"
27426	44	14	11	 So he sprang up and began to walk about. Then the crowds, seeing what Paul had done, rent the air with their shouts in the Lycaonian language, saying, "The gods have assumed human form and have come down to us."
27427	44	14	12	 They called Barnabas `Zeus,' and Paul, as being the principal speaker, `Hermes.'
27428	44	14	13	 And the priest of Zeus--the temple of Zeus being at the entrance to the city--brought bullocks and garlands to  the gates, and in company with the crowd was intending to offer sacrifices to them.
27429	44	14	14	 But the Apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it; and tearing their clothes they rushed out into the middle of the crowd, exclaiming, "Sirs, why are you doing all this?
27430	44	14	15	 We also are but men, with  natures kindred to your own; and we bring you the Good News that you are to turn from these unreal things, to worship the ever-living God, the Creator of earth and sky and sea and of everything that is in them.
27431	44	14	16	 In times gone by He allowed all the nations to go their own ways;
27432	44	14	17	 and yet by His beneficence He has not left His existence unattested--His beneficence, I mean, in sending you rain from Heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and joyfulness."
27433	44	14	18	 Even with words like these they had difficulty in preventing the thronging crowd from offering sacrifices to them.
27434	44	14	19	 But now a party of Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and, having won over the crowd, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the town, believing him to be dead.
27435	44	14	20	 When, however, the disciples had collected round him, he rose and went back into the town. The next day he went with Barnabas to Derbe;
27436	44	14	21	 and, after proclaiming the Good News to the people there and gaining a large number of converts, they retraced their steps to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch.
27437	44	14	22	 Everywhere they strengthened the disciples by encouraging them to hold fast to the faith, and warned them saying, "It is through many afflictions that we must make our way into the Kingdom of God."
27438	44	14	23	 And in every Church, after prayer and fasting, they  selected Elders  by show of hands, and commended them to the Lord on whom their faith rested.
27439	44	14	24	 Then passing through Pisidia they came into Pamphylia;
27440	44	14	25	 and after telling the Message at Perga they came down to Attaleia.
27441	44	14	26	 Thence they sailed to Antioch, where they had previously been commended to the grace of God in connexion with the work which they had now completed.
27442	44	14	27	 Upon their arrival they called the Church together and proceeded to report in detail all that God, working with them, had done, and how He had opened for the Gentiles the door of faith.
27443	44	14	28	 And they remained a considerable time in Antioch with the disciples.
27444	44	15	1	 But certain persons who had come down from Judaea tried to convince the brethren, saying, "Unless you are circumcised in accordance with the Mosaic custom, you cannot be saved."
27445	44	15	2	 Between these new comers and Paul and Barnabas there was no little disagreement and controversy, until at last it was decided that Paul and Barnabas and some other brethren should go up to consult the Apostles and Elders in Jerusalem on this matter.
27446	44	15	3	 So they set out, being accompanied for a short distance by some other members of the Church; and as they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told the whole story of the conversion of the Gentiles and inspired all the brethren with great joy.
27447	44	15	4	 Upon their arrival in Jerusalem they were cordially received by the Church, the Apostles, and  the Elders; and they reported in detail all that God, working with them, had done.
27448	44	15	5	 But certain men who had belonged to the sect of the Pharisees but were now believers, stood up in the assembly, and said, "Yes, Gentile believers ought to be circumcised and be ordered to keep the Law of Moses."
27449	44	15	6	 Then the Apostles and Elders met to consider the  matter;
27450	44	15	7	 and after there had been a long discussion Peter rose to his feet. "It is within  your own knowledge," he said, "that God  originally made choice among you that from my lips the Gentiles were to hear the Message of the Good News, and believe.
27451	44	15	8	 And God, who knows all hearts, gave His testimony in their favour by bestowing the Holy Spirit on them just as He did on us;
27452	44	15	9	 and He made no difference between us and them, in that He cleansed their hearts by their faith.
27453	44	15	10	 Now, therefore, why try an experiment upon God,  by laying on the necks of these disciples a yoke which neither our forefathers nor we have been able to bear?
27454	44	15	11	 On the contrary, we believe that it is by the grace of the Lord Jesus that we, as well as they, shall be saved."
27455	44	15	12	 Then the whole assembly  remained silent while they listened to the statement made by Paul and Barnabas as to all the signs and marvels that God had done among the Gentiles through their instrumentality.
27456	44	15	13	 When they had finished speaking, James said, "Brethren, listen to me.
27457	44	15	14	  Symeon has related how God first looked graciously on the Gentiles to take from among them a People to be called by His name.
27458	44	15	15	 And this is in harmony with the language of the Prophets, which says:
27459	44	15	16	 <"`"Afterwards I will return, and will rebuild David's fallen tent. Its ruins I will rebuild, and I will set it  up again;
27460	44	15	17	 In order that the rest of mankind may earnestly seek the Lord--even all the nations which are called by My name,"
27461	44	15	18	 Says the Lord,  who has been making these things known  from ages long past.'>
27462	44	15	19	 "My judgement, therefore, is against inflicting  unexpected annoyance on those of the Gentiles who are turning  to God.
27463	44	15	20	 Yet let us send them written instructions to abstain from  things polluted by connexion with idolatry, from fornication, from meat killed by strangling, and from blood.
27464	44	15	21	 For Moses from  the earliest times  has had his preachers in every town, being read, as he is, Sabbath after Sabbath, in the various synagogues."
27465	44	15	22	 Thereupon it was decided by the Apostles and Elders, with the approval of the whole Church, to choose suitable persons from among themselves and send them to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas. Judas, called Bar-sabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren, were selected,
27466	44	15	23	 and they took with them the following letter: "The Apostles and the elder brethren send greeting to the Gentile brethren throughout Antioch, Syria and Cilicia.
27467	44	15	24	 As we have been informed that certain persons who have gone out from among us have disturbed you by their teaching and have unsettled your minds, without having received any such instructions from us;
27468	44	15	25	 we have  unanimously decided to select certain men and send them to you in company with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul,
27469	44	15	26	 who have endangered their very lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.
27470	44	15	27	 We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who are themselves bringing you the same message by word of mouth.
27471	44	15	28	 For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no burden heavier than these necessary requirements--
27472	44	15	29	 You must abstain from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from fornication. Keep yourselves clear of these things, and it will be well with you. Farewell."
27473	44	15	30	 They, therefore, having been solemnly sent, came down to Antioch, where they called together the whole assembly and delivered the letter.
27474	44	15	31	 The people  read it, and were delighted with the comfort it brought them.
27475	44	15	32	 And Judas and Silas, being themselves also  Prophets, gave  them a long and encouraging talk, and strengthened them in the faith.
27476	44	15	33	 After spending some time there they received an affectionate farewell from the brethren to return to those who had sent them.
27477	44	15	34	  []
27478	44	15	35	 But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and, in company with many others, telling the Good News of the Lord's Message.
27479	44	15	36	 After a while Paul said to Barnabas, "Suppose we now revisit the brethren in the various towns in which we have made known the Lord's Message--to see whether they are prospering!"
27480	44	15	37	 Barnabas, however, was bent on taking with them John, whose other name was Mark,
27481	44	15	38	 while Paul deemed it undesirable to have as their companion one who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone on with them to the work.
27482	44	15	39	 So there arose a serious disagreement between them, which resulted in their parting from one another, Barnabas taking Mark and setting sail for Cyprus.
27483	44	15	40	 But Paul chose Silas as his travelling companion; and set out, after being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord;
27484	44	15	41	 and he passed through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the Churches.
27485	44	16	1	 He also came to Derbe and to Lystra. At Lystra he found a disciple, Timothy by name--the son of  a Christian Jewess, though he had a Greek father.
27486	44	16	2	 Timothy was well spoken of by the brethren at Lystra and Iconium,
27487	44	16	3	 and Paul desiring that he should accompany him on his journey, took him and circumcised him on account of the Jews in those parts, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
27488	44	16	4	 As they journeyed on from town to town, they handed to the brethren for their observance the decisions which had been arrived at by the Apostles and Elders in Jerusalem.
27489	44	16	5	 So the Churches went on gaining a stronger faith and growing in numbers from day to day.
27490	44	16	6	 Then  Paul and his companions passed through  Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to proclaim the Message in the province of Asia.
27491	44	16	7	 When they reached the frontier of Mysia, they were about to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not permit this.
27492	44	16	8	 So,  passing along Mysia, they came to  Troas.
27493	44	16	9	 Here, one night, Paul saw a vision. There was a Macedonian who was standing, entreating him and saying, "Come over into Macedonia and help us."
27494	44	16	10	 So when he had seen the vision, we immediately looked out for an opportunity of passing on into Macedonia, confidently inferring that God had called us to proclaim the Good News to the people there.
27495	44	16	11	 Accordingly we put out to sea from Troas, and ran a straight course to Samothrace. The next day we came to Neapolis,
27496	44	16	12	 and thence to Philippi,  which is a city in Macedonia, the first in its district, a Roman colony. And there we stayed some little time.
27497	44	16	13	 On the Sabbath we went beyond the city gate to the riverside, where we had reason to believe that there was a place for prayer; and sitting down we talked with the women who had come together.
27498	44	16	14	 Among our hearers was one named Lydia, a dealer in purple goods. She belonged to the city of Thyateira, and was a worshipper  of the true God. The Lord opened her heart, so that she gave attention to what Paul was saying.
27499	44	16	15	 When she and her household had been baptized, she urged us, saying, "If  in your judgement I am a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my house." And she made us go there.
27500	44	16	16	 One day, as we were on our way to the place of prayer, a slave girl met us who  claimed to be inspired and was accustomed to bring her owners large profits by telling fortunes.
27501	44	16	17	 She kept following close behind Paul and the rest of us, crying aloud, "These men are the bondservants of the Most High God, and are proclaiming to you the way of salvation."
27502	44	16	18	 This she persisted in  for a considerable time, until Paul,  wearied out, turned round and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And it came out  immediately.
27503	44	16	19	 But when her owners saw that their hopes of gain were gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them off to the  magistrates in the public square.
27504	44	16	20	 Then they brought them before the praetors. "These men," they said, "are creating a great disturbance in our city.
27505	44	16	21	 They are Jews, and are teaching customs which we, as Romans, are not permitted to adopt or practise."
27506	44	16	22	 The crowd, too,  joined in the outcry against them, till at length the praetors  ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods;
27507	44	16	23	 and, after severely flogging them, they threw them into jail and bade the jailer keep them safely.
27508	44	16	24	 He, having received an order like that, lodged them in the inner prison, and secured their feet in the stocks.
27509	44	16	25	 About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them,
27510	44	16	26	 when suddenly there was such a violent shock of earthquake that the prison shook to its foundations. Instantly the doors all flew open, and the chains  fell off from every prisoner.
27511	44	16	27	 Starting up from sleep and seeing the doors of the jail wide open, the jailer drew his sword and was on the point of killing himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
27512	44	16	28	 But Paul shouted loudly to him, saying, "Do yourself no injury: we are all here.
27513	44	16	29	 Then, calling for lights, he sprang in and fell trembling at the feet of Paul and Silas;
27514	44	16	30	 and, bringing them out of the prison, he exclaimed, "O sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
27515	44	16	31	 "Believe on the Lord Jesus," they replied, "and both you and your household will be saved."
27516	44	16	32	 And they told  the Lord's Message to him as well as to all who were in his house.
27517	44	16	33	 Then he took them, even at that time of night, washed their wounds, and he and all his household were immediately baptized;
27518	44	16	34	 and bringing the Apostles up into his house, he spread a meal for them, and was filled with gladness,  with his whole household,  his faith resting on God.
27519	44	16	35	 In the morning the praetors sent their lictors with the order, "Release those men."
27520	44	16	36	 So the jailer brought Paul word, saying, "The praetors  have sent orders for you to be released. Now therefore you can go, and proceed on your way in peace."
27521	44	16	37	 But Paul said to them, "After  cruelly beating us in public, without trial, Roman citizens though we are, they have thrown us into prison, and are they now going to send us away privately?  No, indeed! Let them come in person and fetch us out."
27522	44	16	38	 This answer the lictors took back to the praetors, who were alarmed when they were told that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens.
27523	44	16	39	 Accordingly they came and  apologized to them; and, bringing them out, asked them to leave the city.
27524	44	16	40	 Then Paul and Silas, having come out of the prison, went to Lydia's house; and, after seeing the brethren and encouraging them, they left Philippi.
27525	44	17	1	 Then, passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they went to Thessalonica. Here there was a synagogue of the Jews.
27526	44	17	2	 Paul--following his usual custom--betook himself to it, and  for three successive Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
27527	44	17	3	 which he clearly explained, pointing out that it had been necessary for the Christ to suffer and rise again from the dead, and insisting, "The Jesus whom I am announcing to you is the Christ."
27528	44	17	4	 Some of the people were won over, and  attached themselves to Paul and Silas, including many  God-fearing Greeks and not a few gentlewomen of high rank.
27529	44	17	5	 But the jealousy of the Jews was aroused, and, calling to their aid some ill-conditioned and idle fellows, they got together a riotous mob and filled the city with uproar. They then attacked the house of Jason and searched for Paul and Silas, to bring them out before the assembly of people.
27530	44	17	6	 But, failing to find them, they dragged Jason and some of the other brethren before the  magistrates of the city, loudly accusing them. "These men," they said, "who have raised a tumult throughout the Empire, have come here also.
27531	44	17	7	 Jason has received them into his house; and they all set Caesar's  authority at defiance, declaring that there is another  Emperor--  one called Jesus."
27532	44	17	8	 Great was the excitement among the crowd, and among the magistrates of the city, when they heard these charges.
27533	44	17	9	 They required Jason and the rest to find substantial bail, and after that they let them go.
27534	44	17	10	 The brethren at once sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea, and they, on their arrival, went to the synagogue of the Jews.
27535	44	17	11	 The Jews at Beroea were of a nobler disposition than those in Thessalonica, for they very readily received the Message, and day after day searched the Scriptures to see whether  it was as Paul stated.
27536	44	17	12	 As the result many of them became believers, and so did not a few of the Greeks--gentlewomen of good position, and men.
27537	44	17	13	 As soon, however, as the  Jews of Thessalonica learnt that God's Message  had been proclaimed by Paul at Beroea, they came there also, and incited the mob to a riot.
27538	44	17	14	 Then the brethren promptly sent Paul down to the sea-coast, but Silas and Timothy remained behind.
27539	44	17	15	 Those who were caring for Paul's safety went with him as far as Athens, and then left him, taking a message from him to Silas and Timothy, asking them to join him as speedily as possible.
27540	44	17	16	 While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit  was stirred within him when he noticed that the city was full of idols.
27541	44	17	17	 So he  had discussions in the synagogue with the Jews and the other  worshippers, and in the market place, day after day, with those whom he happened to meet.
27542	44	17	18	 A few of the Epicurean and Stoic  philosophers also  encountered him. Some of them asked, "What has this  beggarly babbler to say?" "His business," said others, "seems to be to cry up some foreign gods." This was because he had been telling the Good News of Jesus and the  Resurrection.
27543	44	17	19	 Then they  took him and brought him up to  the Areopagus, asking him, "May we be told what this new teaching of yours is?
27544	44	17	20	 For the things you are saying sound strange to us. We should therefore like to be told exactly what they mean."
27545	44	17	21	 (For all the Athenians and their foreign visitors used to devote their whole leisure to telling or hearing about something new.)
27546	44	17	22	 So Paul, taking his stand in the centre of the Areopagus, spoke as follows:  "Men of Athens, I perceive that you are in every respect remarkably religious.
27547	44	17	23	 For as I passed along and observed the things you worship, I found also an altar bearing the inscription,  `TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.'  "The Being, therefore, whom you, without knowing Him, revere, Him I now proclaim to you.
27548	44	17	24	 GOD who made the universe and everything in it--He, being Lord of Heaven and earth, does not dwell in sanctuaries built by men.
27549	44	17	25	 Nor is He ministered to by human hands, as though He needed anything--but He Himself gives to all men life and breath and all things.
27550	44	17	26	  He caused to spring  from one forefather people of every race, for them to live on the whole surface of the earth, and marked out for them an appointed span of life and the boundaries of their homes;
27551	44	17	27	  that they might seek God, if perhaps they could grope for Him and find Him. Yes, though He is not far from any one of us.
27552	44	17	28	 For it is in closest union with Him that we live and move and have our being; as in fact some of the poets in repute among yourselves have said, `For we are also His offspring.'
27553	44	17	29	 Since then we are God's offspring, we ought not to imagine that His nature resembles gold or silver or marble, or anything sculptured by the art and inventive faculty of man.
27554	44	17	30	 Those times of ignorance God viewed with indulgence. But now He commands all men everywhere to repent,
27555	44	17	31	 seeing that He has appointed a day on which, before long, He will judge  the world in righteousness,  through the instrumentality of a man whom He has pre-destined to this work, and has made the fact certain to every one by raising Him from the dead."
27556	44	17	32	 When they heard Paul speak of a resurrection of dead men, some began to scoff. But others said, "We will hear you again on that subject."
27557	44	17	33	 So Paul went away from them.
27558	44	17	34	 A few, however, attached themselves to him and believed, among them being Dionysius a member of the Council, a gentlewoman named Damaris, and some others.
27559	44	18	1	 After this he left Athens and came to Corinth.
27560	44	18	2	 Here he found a Jew,  a native of Pontus, of the name of Aquila. He and his wife Priscilla had recently come from Italy because of Claudius's edict expelling all the Jews from Rome. So Paul paid them a visit;
27561	44	18	3	 and because he was of the same trade--that of  tent-maker--he lodged with them  and worked with them.
27562	44	18	4	 But, Sabbath after Sabbath, he preached in the synagogue and tried to win over both Jews and Greeks.
27563	44	18	5	 Now at the time when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was preaching fervently and was solemnly telling the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.
27564	44	18	6	 But upon their opposing him with abusive language, he shook his clothes by way of protest, and said to them, "Your ruin will be upon your own heads. I am not responsible: in future I will go among the Gentiles."
27565	44	18	7	 So he left the place and went to the house of a person called Titius Justus, a worshipper of the true God. His house was next door to the synagogue.
27566	44	18	8	 And Crispus, the Warden of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, and so did all his household; and  from time to time many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and received baptism.
27567	44	18	9	 And, in a vision by night, the Lord said to Paul, "Dismiss your fears: go on speaking, and do not give up.
27568	44	18	10	 I am with you, and no one shall attack you to injure you; for I have very many people in this city."
27569	44	18	11	 So Paul remained in Corinth for a year and six months, teaching among them the Message of God.
27570	44	18	12	 But when Gallio became Proconsul of Greece, the Jews with one accord made a dead set at Paul, and brought him before the court.
27571	44	18	13	 "This man," they said, "is inducing people to offer unlawful worship to God."
27572	44	18	14	 But, when Paul was about to begin his defence, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it had been some wrongful act or piece of cunning knavery I might reasonably have listened to you Jews.
27573	44	18	15	 But since these are questions about words and names and your Law, you yourselves must see to them. I refuse to be a judge in such matters."
27574	44	18	16	 So he ordered them out of court.
27575	44	18	17	 Then the people all set upon Sosthenes, the Warden of  the synagogue, and beat him  severely in front of the court. Gallio did not concern himself in the least about this.
27576	44	18	18	 After remaining a considerable time longer in Corinth, Paul took leave of the brethren and set sail for Syria; and Priscilla and Aquila were with him.  He had shaved his head at Cenchreae, because he was bound by a vow.
27577	44	18	19	 They put in at Ephesus, and there Paul left his companions behind. As for himself, he went to the synagogue and  had a discussion with the Jews.
27578	44	18	20	 When they asked him to remain longer he did not consent,
27579	44	18	21	 but took leave of them with the promise, "I will return to you, God willing." So he set sail from Ephesus.
27580	44	18	22	 Landing at Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and inquired after the welfare of the Church, and then went down to Antioch.
27581	44	18	23	 After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out on a tour, visiting the whole of Galatia and Phrygia in order, and strengthening all the disciples.
27582	44	18	24	 Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos came to Ephesus. He was a native of Alexandria,  a man of great learning and well versed in the Scriptures.
27583	44	18	25	 He had been instructed by word of mouth in the way of the Lord, and, being full of burning zeal, he used to speak and teach accurately the facts about Jesus, though he knew of no baptism but John's.
27584	44	18	26	 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, and Priscilla and Aquila, after hearing him, took him home and explained  God's way to him more accurately.
27585	44	18	27	 Then, as he had made up his mind to cross over into Greece, the brethren wrote to the disciples in Corinth begging them to give him a kindly welcome. Upon his arrival he rendered valuable help to those who through grace had believed;
27586	44	18	28	 for he powerfully and in public overcame the Jews in argument, proving to them from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.
27587	44	19	1	 During the stay of Apollos in Corinth, Paul, after passing through the inland districts, came to Ephesus, where he found a few disciples.
27588	44	19	2	 "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you  first believed?" he asked them. "No," they replied, "we did not even hear that there is a Holy Spirit."
27589	44	19	3	  "Into what then were you baptized?" he asked.  "Into John's baptism," they replied.
27590	44	19	4	 "John," he said, "administered a baptism  of repentance, bidding the people believe on One who was to come after him; namely, on Jesus."
27591	44	19	5	 On hearing this, they were baptized  into the name of the Lord Jesus;
27592	44	19	6	 and when Paul laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began to speak in tongues and  to prophesy.
27593	44	19	7	 They numbered in all about twelve men.
27594	44	19	8	 Afterwards he went into the synagogue. There for three months he continued to preach fearlessly, explaining in words which carried conviction the truths which concern the Kingdom of God.
27595	44	19	9	 But some grew obstinate in unbelief and spoke evil of  the new faith before all the congregation. So Paul left them, and,  taking with him those who were disciples, held discussions daily in Tyrannus's lecture-hall.
27596	44	19	10	 This went on for two years, so that  all the inhabitants of the province of Asia, Jews as well as Greeks, heard the Lord's Message.
27597	44	19	11	 God also brought about extraordinary miracles through Paul's instrumentality.
27598	44	19	12	  Towels or aprons, for instance, which Paul had handled used to be carried to the sick, and they recovered from their ailments,  or the evil spirits left them.
27599	44	19	13	 But there were also some wandering Jewish exorcists who undertook to invoke the name of Jesus over those who had the evil spirits, saying, "I command you by that Jesus whom Paul preaches."
27600	44	19	14	 There were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew of high-priestly family, who were doing this.
27601	44	19	15	 "Jesus I know," the evil spirit answered, "and Paul  I have heard of, but who are you?"
27602	44	19	16	 And the man in whom the evil spirit was sprang on two of them, over-mastered them both, and treated them with such violence, that they fled from the house stripped of their clothes and wounded.
27603	44	19	17	 All the people of Ephesus, Jews as well as Greeks, came to know of this. There was widespread terror, and they  began to hold the name of the Lord Jesus in high honour.
27604	44	19	18	 Many also of those who  believed  came confessing without reserve what their conduct had been,
27605	44	19	19	 and not a few of those who had practised magical arts brought their books together and  burnt them in the presence of all. The total value was reckoned and found to be  50,000 silver coins.
27606	44	19	20	 Thus mightily did the Lord's Message spread and triumph!
27607	44	19	21	 When matters had reached this point, Paul decided in his own  mind to travel through Macedonia and Greece, and go to Jerusalem. "After that," he said, "I must also see Rome."
27608	44	19	22	 But he sent two of  his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he himself remained for a while in Roman Asia.
27609	44	19	23	 Now just at that time there arose no small commotion about  the new faith.
27610	44	19	24	 There was a certain Demetrius, a silversmith, who made miniature silver sanctuaries of  Diana, a business which brought great gain to the mechanics in his employ.
27611	44	19	25	 He called his workmen together, and others who were engaged in similar trades, and said to them, "You men well know that our prosperity depends on this business of ours;
27612	44	19	26	 and you see and hear that, not in Ephesus only but throughout almost the whole province of Asia, this fellow Paul has led away a vast number of people by inducing them to believe that they are not gods at all that are made by men's hands.
27613	44	19	27	 There is danger,  therefore, not only that this our trade will become of no account, but also that the  temple of the great goddess Diana will fall into utter disrepute, and that before long she will be actually deposed from her majestic rank--she who is now worshipped by the whole province of Asia; nay, by the whole world."
27614	44	19	28	 After listening to this harangue, they became furiously angry and kept calling out, "Great is the Ephesian Diana!"
27615	44	19	29	 The riot and uproar spread through the whole city, till at last with one accord they rushed into  the Theatre, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, two Macedonians who were fellow travellers with Paul.
27616	44	19	30	 Then Paul would have liked to go in and address the people, but the disciples would not let him do so.
27617	44	19	31	 A few of the  public officials, too, who were friendly to him, sent repeated messages entreating him not to venture into the Theatre.
27618	44	19	32	 The people, meanwhile, kept shouting,  some one thing and some another; for the assembly was all uproar and confusion, and the greater part had no idea why they had come together.
27619	44	19	33	 Then some of the people  crowded round Alexander, whom the Jews had pushed forward; and Alexander, motioning with his hand to get silence, was prepared to make a defence to the people.
27620	44	19	34	 No sooner, however, did they see that he was a Jew, than there arose from them all one roar of shouting, lasting about two hours. "Great is the Ephesian Diana," they said.
27621	44	19	35	 At length the  Recorder quieted them down. "Men of Ephesus," he said, "who is there of all mankind that needs to be told that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Diana and of the image which fell down from Zeus?
27622	44	19	36	 These facts, then, being unquestioned, it becomes you to maintain your self-control and not act recklessly.
27623	44	19	37	 For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.
27624	44	19	38	 If, however, Demetrius and the mechanics who support his contention have a grievance against any one,  there are Assize-days and there are Proconsuls: let the persons interested accuse one another.
27625	44	19	39	 But if you desire  anything further, it will have to be settled in the regular assembly.
27626	44	19	40	 For in connexion with to-day's proceedings there is danger of our being charged with attempted insurrection, there having been no real reason for this riot; nor shall we be able to justify the behaviour of this disorderly mob."
27627	44	19	41	 With these words he dismissed the assembly.
27628	44	20	1	 When the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples; and, after speaking words of encouragement to them, he took his leave, and started for Macedonia.
27629	44	20	2	 Passing through those districts he encouraged the disciples in frequent addresses, and then came into  Greece, and spent three months there.
27630	44	20	3	 The Jews having planned to waylay him whenever he might be on the point of taking ship for Syria, he decided to travel back by way of Macedonia.
27631	44	20	4	 He was accompanied as far as the province of Asia by Sopater the Beroean, the son of Pyrrhus; by the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; by Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and by the Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus.
27632	44	20	5	 These brethren had gone on and were waiting for us in the Troad.
27633	44	20	6	 But we ourselves sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and five days later joined them in the Troad, where we remained for a week.
27634	44	20	7	 On the first day of the week, when we had met to break bread, Paul, who was going away the next morning, was preaching to them, and prolonged his discourse till midnight.
27635	44	20	8	 Now there were a good many lamps in the room upstairs where we all were,
27636	44	20	9	 and a youth of the name of Eutychus was sitting at the window. This lad, gradually sinking into deep sleep while Paul preached at unusual length, overcome at last by sleep, fell from the second floor and was taken up dead.
27637	44	20	10	 Paul, however, went down, threw himself upon him, and folding him in his arms said,  "Do not be alarmed; his life is still in him."
27638	44	20	11	 Then he went  upstairs again, broke bread, and took some food; and after a long conversation which was continued till daybreak, at last he parted from them.
27639	44	20	12	 They had taken the lad home alive, and were greatly comforted.
27640	44	20	13	 The rest of us had already gone on board a ship, and now we set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul on board there; for so he had arranged, he himself intending to go by land.
27641	44	20	14	 Accordingly, when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene.
27642	44	20	15	 Sailing from there, we arrived the next day  off Chios. On the next we touched at  Samos; and on the day following reached Miletus.
27643	44	20	16	 For Paul's plan was to sail past Ephesus, so as not to spend much time in the province of Asia; since he was very desirous of being in Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of the  Harvest Festival.
27644	44	20	17	 From Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the  Elders of the Church to come to him.
27645	44	20	18	 Upon their arrival he said to them, "You Elders well know, from the first day of my setting foot in the province of Asia, the kind of life I lived among you the whole time,
27646	44	20	19	 serving the Lord  in all humility, and  with  tears, and  amid trials which came upon me through the plotting of the Jews--
27647	44	20	20	 and that I never shrank from declaring to you anything that was profitable, or from teaching you in public and in your homes,
27648	44	20	21	 and urging upon both Jews and Greeks the necessity of turning to God and of believing in Jesus  our Lord.
27649	44	20	22	 "And now,  impelled by a sense of duty, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,
27650	44	20	23	 except that the Holy Spirit, at town after town, testifies to me that imprisonment and suffering are awaiting me.
27651	44	20	24	 But even  the sacrifice of my life I count as nothing, if only I may perfect my earthly course, and be faithful to the  duty which the Lord Jesus has entrusted to me of proclaiming, as of supreme importance, the Good News of God's grace.
27652	44	20	25	 "And now, I know that none of you among whom I have gone in and out proclaiming the coming of the Kingdom will any longer see my face.
27653	44	20	26	 Therefore I protest to you to-day that I am not responsible for the ruin of any one of you.
27654	44	20	27	 For I have not shrunk from declaring to you God's whole  truth.
27655	44	20	28	 "Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock among which the Holy Spirit has  placed you to take the oversight  for Him and act as shepherds to  the Church of God, which He has bought with His own blood.
27656	44	20	29	 I know that, when I am gone, cruel wolves will come among you and will not spare the flock;
27657	44	20	30	 and that from among your own selves men will rise up who will seek with their perverse talk to draw away the disciples after them.
27658	44	20	31	 Therefore be on the alert; and remember that, night and day, for three years, I never ceased admonishing every one, even with tears.
27659	44	20	32	 "And now I commend you to God and to the word of His grace. He is able to build you up and to give you your inheritance among His people.
27660	44	20	33	 No one's silver or gold or clothing  have I coveted.
27661	44	20	34	 You yourselves know that  these hands of mine have provided for my own necessities and for the people with me.
27662	44	20	35	 In all things I have set you an example, showing you that, by working as I do, you ought to help the weak, and to bear in mind the words of the Lord Jesus, how He Himself said, "`It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"
27663	44	20	36	 Having spoken thus, Paul knelt down and prayed with them all;
27664	44	20	37	 and with loud lamentation they all threw their arms round his neck, and kissed him  lovingly,
27665	44	20	38	 grieved above all things at his having told them that  after that day they were no longer to see his face. And they went with him to the ship.
27666	44	21	1	 When, at last, we had torn ourselves away and had set sail, we ran in a straight course to Cos; the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.
27667	44	21	2	 Finding a ship bound for Phoenicia, we went on board and put to sea.
27668	44	21	3	 After sighting Cyprus and leaving that island on our left, we continued our voyage to Syria and put in at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload her cargo.
27669	44	21	4	 Having searched for the disciples and found them, we stayed at Tyre for seven days; and, taught by the Spirit, they repeatedly urged Paul not to proceed to Jerusalem.
27670	44	21	5	 When, however, our time was up, we left and went on our way, all the disciples and their wives and children coming to see us off. Then, after kneeling down on the beach and praying,
27671	44	21	6	 we took leave of one another; and we went on board, while they returned home.
27672	44	21	7	 As for us, our voyage was over when having sailed from Tyre we reached Ptolemais. here we inquired after the welfare of the brethren, and remained a day with them.
27673	44	21	8	 On the morrow  we left Ptolemais and  went on to Caesarea, where we came to the house of Philip the Evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.
27674	44	21	9	 Now Philip had four unmarried daughters who were prophetesses;
27675	44	21	10	 and  during our somewhat lengthy stay a Prophet of the name of Agabus came down from Judaea.
27676	44	21	11	 When he arrived he took Paul's  loincloth, and bound his own feet and arms with it, and said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit, `So will the Jews in Jerusalem bind the owner of this loincloth, and will hand him over to the Gentiles.'"
27677	44	21	12	 As soon as we heard these words, both we and the brethren at Caesarea entreated Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.
27678	44	21	13	 His reply was, "What can you mean by thus breaking my heart with your grief? Why, as for me, I am ready not only to go to Jerusalem and be put in chains, but even to die there for the sake of the Lord Jesus."
27679	44	21	14	 So when he was not to be dissuaded, we ceased remonstrating with him and said, "The Lord's will be done!"
27680	44	21	15	 A few days afterwards we loaded our baggage-cattle and continued our journey to Jerusalem.
27681	44	21	16	 Some of the disciples from Caesarea also joined our party, and  brought with them Mnason, a Cyprian, one of the early disciples, at whose house we were to lodge.
27682	44	21	17	 At length we reached Jerusalem, and there the brethren gave us a hearty welcome.
27683	44	21	18	 On the following day we went with Paul to call on James, and all the Elders of the Church came also.
27684	44	21	19	 After exchanging friendly greetings, Paul told in detail all that God had done among the Gentiles through his instrumentality.
27685	44	21	20	 And they, when they had heard his statement, gave the glory to God. Then they said, "You see, brother,  how many tens of thousands of Jews there are among those who have accepted the faith, and they are all zealous upholders of the Law.
27686	44	21	21	 Now what they have been repeatedly told about you is that you teach all the Jews among the Gentiles to abandon Moses, and that you forbid them to circumcise their children or observe old-established customs.
27687	44	21	22	 What then ought you to do? They are sure to hear that you have come to Jerusalem;
27688	44	21	23	 so do this which we now tell you. We have four men here who have a vow resting on them.
27689	44	21	24	 Associate with these men and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses so that they can shave their heads. Then everybody will know that there is no truth in these stories about you, but that in your own actions you yourself  scrupulously obey the Law.
27690	44	21	25	 But as for the Gentiles who have accepted the faith, we have communicated to them our decision  that they are carefully to abstain from anything sacrificed to an idol, from blood, from what is strangled, and from fornication."
27691	44	21	26	 So Paul associated with the men; and the next day,  having purified himself with them, he  went into the Temple, giving  every one to understand that the days of their purification were finished, and there he remained  until the sacrifice for each of them was offered.
27692	44	21	27	 But, when the seven days were nearly over, the Jews from the province of Asia, having seen Paul in the Temple, set about rousing the fury of all the people against him.
27693	44	21	28	 They laid hands on him, crying out, "Men of Israel, help! help! This is the man who goes everywhere preaching to everybody against the Jewish people and the Law and this place. And besides, he has even brought Gentiles into the Temple and has desecrated this holy place."
27694	44	21	29	 (For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and imagined that Paul had brought him into the Temple.)
27695	44	21	30	 The excitement spread through the whole city, and the people rushed in crowds to the Temple, and there laid hold of Paul and began to drag him out; and the Temple gates were immediately closed.
27696	44	21	31	 But while they were trying to kill Paul, word was taken up to the Tribune in command of the battalion, that all Jerusalem was in a ferment.
27697	44	21	32	 He instantly sent for a few soldiers and their officers, and came down among the people with all speed. At the sight of the Tribune and the troops they ceased beating Paul.
27698	44	21	33	 Then the Tribune, making his way to him, arrested him, and, having ordered him to be secured with two chains, proceeded to ask who he was and what he had been doing.
27699	44	21	34	 Some of the crowd shouted one accusation against Paul and some another, until, as the uproar made it impossible for the truth to be ascertained with certainty, the Tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks.
27700	44	21	35	 When Paul was going up the steps, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob;
27701	44	21	36	 for the whole mass of the people pressed on in the rear, shouting, "Away with him!"
27702	44	21	37	 When he was about to be taken into the barracks, Paul said to the Tribune, "May I speak to you?" "Do you know Greek?" the Tribune asked.
27703	44	21	38	 "Are you not the Egyptian who some years ago excited the riot of the 4,000  cut-throats, and led them out into the Desert?"
27704	44	21	39	 "I am a Jew," replied Paul, "belonging to Tarsus in Cilicia, and am a citizen of no unimportant city. Give me leave, I pray you, to speak to the people."
27705	44	21	40	 So with his permission Paul stood on the steps and motioned with his hand to the people to be quiet; and when there was perfect silence he addressed them in Hebrew.
27706	44	22	1	 "Brethren and fathers," he said, "listen to my defence which I now make before you."
27707	44	22	2	 And on hearing him address them in Hebrew, they kept all the more quiet; and he said,
27708	44	22	3	 "I am a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city. I was carefully trained at the feet of Gamaliel in the Law of our forefathers, and, like all of you to-day, was zealous for God.
27709	44	22	4	 I persecuted to death this new faith, continually binding both men and women and throwing them into prison;
27710	44	22	5	 as the High Priest also and all the Elders can bear me witness. It was, too, from them that I received letters to the brethren in Damascus, and I was already on my way to Damascus, intending to bring those also who had fled there, in chains to Jerusalem, to be punished.
27711	44	22	6	 "But on my way, when I was now not far from Damascus, about noon a sudden blaze of light from Heaven shone round me.
27712	44	22	7	 I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, "`Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?'
27713	44	22	8	 "`Who art thou, Lord?' I asked. "`I am Jesus, the Nazarene,' He replied, `whom you are persecuting.'
27714	44	22	9	 "Now the men who were with me, though they saw the light, did not hear the  words of Him who spoke to me.
27715	44	22	10	 And I asked, "`What am I to do, Lord?' "And the Lord said to me, "`Rise, and go into Damascus. There you shall be told of all that has been appointed for you to do.'
27716	44	22	11	 "And as I could not see because the light had been so dazzling, those who were with me had to lead me by the arm, and so I came to Damascus.
27717	44	22	12	 "And a certain Ananias, a pious man who obeyed the Law and bore a good character with all the Jews of the city,
27718	44	22	13	 came to me and standing at my side said, "`Brother Saul, recover your sight.' "I instantly  regained my sight and looked up at him.
27719	44	22	14	 Then he said, `The God of our forefathers has appointed you to know His will, and to see the righteous One and hear Him speak.
27720	44	22	15	 For you shall be a witness for Him, to all men, of what  you have seen and heard.
27721	44	22	16	 And now why delay? Rise, get yourself baptized, and wash off your sins, calling upon His name.'
27722	44	22	17	 "After my return to Jerusalem, and while praying in the Temple, I fell into a trance.
27723	44	22	18	 I saw Jesus, and He said to me, "`Make haste and leave Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about Me.'
27724	44	22	19	 "`Lord,' I replied, `they themselves well know how active I was in imprisoning, and in flogging in synagogue after synagogue those who believe in Thee;
27725	44	22	20	 and when they were shedding the blood of Stephen, Thy witness, I was standing by, fully approving of it, and I held the clothes of those who were killing him.'
27726	44	22	21	 "`Go,' He replied; `I will send you as an Apostle  to nations far away.'"
27727	44	22	22	 Until they heard this last statement the people listened to Paul, but now with a roar of disapproval they cried out, "Away with such a fellow from the earth! He ought not to be allowed to live."
27728	44	22	23	 And when they continued their furious shouts, throwing their clothes into the air and flinging dust about,
27729	44	22	24	 the Tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and be examined by flogging, in order to ascertain the reason why they thus cried out against him.
27730	44	22	25	 But, when they had tied him up  with the straps, Paul said to the Captain who stood by, "Does the Law permit you to flog a Roman citizen--and one too who is uncondemned?"
27731	44	22	26	 On hearing this question, the Captain went to report the matter to the Tribune.  "What are you intending to do?" he said. "This man is a Roman citizen."
27732	44	22	27	 So the Tribune came to Paul and asked him, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" "Yes," he said.
27733	44	22	28	 "I paid a large sum for my citizenship," said the Tribune. "But I was born free," said Paul.
27734	44	22	29	 So the men who had been on the point of putting him  under torture immediately left him. And the Tribune, too, was frightened when he learnt that Paul was a Roman citizen, for he had had him bound.
27735	44	22	30	 The next day, wishing to know exactly what charge was being brought against him by the Jews, the Tribune ordered his chains to be removed; and, having sent word to the High Priests and all the Sanhedrin to assemble, he brought Paul down and made him stand before them.
27736	44	23	1	 Then Paul, fixing a steady gaze on the Sanhedrin, said, "Brethren, it is with a perfectly clear conscience that I have discharged my duties before God up to this day."
27737	44	23	2	 On hearing this the High Priest Ananias ordered those who were standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth.
27738	44	23	3	 "Before long," exclaimed Paul,  "God will strike you, you white-washed wall! Are you sitting there to judge me in accordance with the Law, and do you yourself actually break the Law by ordering me to be struck?"
27739	44	23	4	 "Do you rail at God's High Priest?" cried the men who stood by him.
27740	44	23	5	 "I did not know, brethren," replied Paul, "that he was the High Priest; for it is written, <`Thou shalt not speak evil of a ruler of Thy people.'">
27741	44	23	6	 Noticing, however, that the Sanhedrin consisted partly of Sadducees and partly of  Pharisees, he called out loudly among them, "Brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees. It is because of my hope of a resurrection of the dead that I am on my trial."
27742	44	23	7	 These words of his caused an angry dispute between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly took different sides.
27743	44	23	8	 For the Sadducees maintain that there is no resurrection, and neither angel nor spirit; but the Pharisees acknowledge the existence of both.
27744	44	23	9	 So there arose a great uproar; and some of the Scribes belonging to the sect of the Pharisees sprang to their feet and fiercely contended, saying, "We find no harm in the man.  What if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel----!"
27745	44	23	10	 But when the struggle was becoming violent, the Tribune, fearing that Paul would be torn to pieces by the people, ordered the troops to go down and take him from among them by force and bring him into the barracks.
27746	44	23	11	 The following night the Lord came and stood at Paul's side, and said, "Be of good courage, for as you have borne faithful witness about me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness in Rome."
27747	44	23	12	 Now, when daylight came, the Jews formed a conspiracy and solemnly swore not to eat or drink till they had killed Paul.
27748	44	23	13	 There were more than forty of them who bound themselves by this oath.
27749	44	23	14	 They went to the High Priests and Elders and said to them, "We have bound ourselves under a heavy curse  to take no food till we have killed Paul.
27750	44	23	15	 Now therefore you and the Sanhedrin should make representations to the Tribune for him to bring him down to you, under the impression that you intend to inquire more minutely about him; and we are prepared to assassinate him before he comes near the place."
27751	44	23	16	 But Paul's sister's son heard of the intended attack upon him. So he came and went into the barracks and told Paul about it;
27752	44	23	17	 and Paul called one of the Captains and said, "Take this young man to the Tribune, for he has information to give him."
27753	44	23	18	 So he took him and brought him to the Tribune, and said, "Paul, the prisoner, called me to him and begged me to bring this youth to you, because he has something to say to you."
27754	44	23	19	 Then the Tribune, taking him by the  arm, withdrew  out of the hearing of others and asked him, "What have you to tell me?"
27755	44	23	20	 "The Jews," he replied, "have agreed to request you to bring Paul down to the Sanhedrin to-morrow for the purpose of making yourself more accurately acquainted with the case.
27756	44	23	21	 I beg you not to comply; for more than forty men among them are lying in wait for him, who have solemnly vowed that they will neither eat nor drink till they have assassinated him; and even now they are ready, in anticipation of receiving that promise of you."
27757	44	23	22	 So the Tribune sent the youth home, cautioning him. "Do not let any one know that you have given me this information," he said.
27758	44	23	23	 Then, calling to him two of the Captains, he gave his orders. "Get ready two hundred men," he said, "to march to Caesarea, with seventy cavalry and two hundred light infantry, starting at nine o'clock to-night."
27759	44	23	24	 He further told them to provide  horses to mount Paul on, so as to bring him safely to Felix the Governor.
27760	44	23	25	 He also wrote a letter of which these were the  contents:
27761	44	23	26	 "Claudius Lysias to his Excellency, Felix the Governor: all good wishes.
27762	44	23	27	 This man Paul had been seized by the Jews, and they were on the point of killing him, when I came upon them with the troops and rescued him, for I had been informed that he was a Roman citizen.
27763	44	23	28	 And, wishing to know with certainty the offense of which they were accusing him, I brought him down into their Sanhedrin,
27764	44	23	29	 and I discovered that the charge had to do with questions of their Law, but that he was accused of nothing for which he deserves death or imprisonment.
27765	44	23	30	 But now that I have received information of an intended attack upon him, I immediately send him to you, directing his accusers also to state before you the case they have against him."
27766	44	23	31	 So, in obedience to their orders, the soldiers took Paul and brought him by night as far as Antipatris.
27767	44	23	32	 The next day the infantry returned to the barracks, leaving the cavalry to proceed with him;
27768	44	23	33	 and, the cavalry having reached Caesarea and delivered the letter to the Governor, they brought Paul also to him.
27769	44	23	34	 Felix, after reading the letter, inquired from what province he was; and being told "from Cilicia,"
27770	44	23	35	 he said, "I will hear all you have to say, when your accusers also have come." And he ordered him to be detained in custody in Herod's Palace.
27771	44	24	1	  Five days after this, Ananias the High Priest came down to Caesarea with a number of Elders and a pleader called Tertullus. They stated to the Governor the case against Paul.
27772	44	24	2	 So Paul was sent for, and Tertullus began to impeach him as follows: "Indebted as we are," he said, "to you, most noble Felix, for the perfect peace which we enjoy, and for reforms which your wisdom has introduced to this nation,
27773	44	24	3	 in every instance and in every place we accept them with profound gratitude.
27774	44	24	4	 But--not to detain you too long--I beg you in your forbearance to listen to a brief statement from us.
27775	44	24	5	 For we have found this man Paul a source of mischief and a disturber of the peace among all the Jews throughout the Empire, and a ringleader in the heresy of the Nazarenes.
27776	44	24	6	 He even attempted to profane the Temple, but we arrested him.
27777	44	24	7	  []
27778	44	24	8	 You, however, by examining him, will yourself be able to learn the truth as to all this which we allege against him."
27779	44	24	9	 The Jews also  joined in the charge, maintaining that these were facts.
27780	44	24	10	 Then, at  a sign from the Governor, Paul answered, "Knowing,  Sir, that for many years you have administered justice to this nation, I cheerfully make my defence.
27781	44	24	11	 For you have it in your power to ascertain that it is not more than twelve days ago that I went up to worship in Jerusalem;
27782	44	24	12	 and that neither in the Temple nor in the synagogues, nor anywhere in the city, did they find me disputing with any opponent or collecting a crowd about me.
27783	44	24	13	 Nor can they  prove the charges which they are now bringing against me.
27784	44	24	14	 But this I confess to you--that in the way which they style a heresy, I worship the God of our forefathers, believing everything that is taught in the Law or is written in the Prophets,
27785	44	24	15	 and having a hope directed towards God, which my accusers themselves also entertain, that before long there will be a resurrection both of the righteous and the unrighteous.
27786	44	24	16	 This too is my own earnest endeavour--always to have a clear conscience in relation to God and man.
27787	44	24	17	 "Now after an interval of several years I came to bring alms to my nation, and to offer sacrifices.
27788	44	24	18	 While I was busy about these, they found me in the Temple purified, with no crowd around me and no uproar; but there were certain Jews from the province of Asia.
27789	44	24	19	 They ought to have been here before you, and to have been my prosecutors, if they have any charge to bring against me.
27790	44	24	20	 Or let these men themselves say what misdemeanour they found me guilty of when I stood before the Sanhedrin,
27791	44	24	21	 unless it was in that one expression which I made use of when I shouted out as I stood among them, "`The resurrection of the dead is the thing about which I am on my trial before you to-day.'"
27792	44	24	22	 At this point Felix, who was fairly well informed about the new faith, adjourned the trial, saying to the Jews, "When the Tribune Lysias comes down, I will enter carefully into the matter."
27793	44	24	23	 And he gave orders to the Captain that Paul was to be kept in custody, but be treated with indulgence, and that his personal friends were not to be prevented from showing him kindness.
27794	44	24	24	 Not long after this, Felix came with Drusilla his wife, a Jewess, and sending for Paul, listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus.
27795	44	24	25	 But when he dealt with the subjects of justice,  self-control, and the judgement which was soon to come, Felix became alarmed and said, "For the present leave me, and when I can find a convenient opportunity I will send for you."
27796	44	24	26	 At the same time he hoped that Paul would give him money; and for this reason he sent for him the oftener to converse with him.
27797	44	24	27	 But after the lapse of fully two years Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and being desirous of gratifying the Jews, Felix left Paul still  in prison.
27798	44	25	1	 Festus, having entered on his duties as governor of the province, two days later went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.
27799	44	25	2	 The High Priests and the leading men among the Jews immediately made representations to him against Paul, and begged him--
27800	44	25	3	 asking it as a favour, to Paul's prejudice--to have him brought to Jerusalem. They were planning an ambush to kill him on the way.
27801	44	25	4	 Festus, however, replied that Paul was in custody  in Caesarea, and that he was himself going there very soon.
27802	44	25	5	 "Therefore let those of you," he said, "who can come, go down with me, and impeach the man, if there is anything amiss in him."
27803	44	25	6	 After a stay of eight or ten days in Jerusalem--not more--he went down to Caesarea; and the next day, taking his seat on the tribunal, he ordered Paul to be brought in.
27804	44	25	7	 Upon Paul's arrival, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood round him, and brought many grave charges against him which they were unable to substantiate.
27805	44	25	8	 But, in reply, Paul said, "Neither against the Jewish Law, nor against the Temple, nor against Caesar, have I committed any offence whatever."
27806	44	25	9	 Then Festus, being anxious to gratify the Jews, asked Paul, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem, and there  stand your trial before me on these charges?"
27807	44	25	10	 "I am standing before Caesar's tribunal," replied Paul, "where alone I ought to be tried. The Jews have no real ground of complaint against me, as in fact you yourself are beginning to see more clearly.
27808	44	25	11	 If, however, I have done wrong and have committed any offence for which I deserve to die, I do not ask to be excused that penalty. But if there is no truth in what these men allege against me, no one has the right to give me up to them as a favour. I appeal to Caesar."
27809	44	25	12	 Then, after conferring with the Council, Festus replied, "To Caesar you have appealed: to Caesar you shall go."
27810	44	25	13	 A short time after this, Agrippa the king and Bernice came to Caesarea to pay a complimentary visit to Festus;
27811	44	25	14	 and, during their rather long stay, Festus laid Paul's case before the king. "There is a man here," he said, "whom Felix left a prisoner,
27812	44	25	15	 about whom, when I went to Jerusalem, the High Priests and the Elders of the Jews made representations to me, begging that sentence might be pronounced against him.
27813	44	25	16	 My reply was that it is not the custom among the Romans to give up any one for punishment before the accused has had his accusers face to face, and has had an opportunity of defending himself against the charge which has been brought against him.
27814	44	25	17	 "When, therefore, a number of them came here, the next day I took my seat on the tribunal, without any loss of time, and ordered the man to be brought in.
27815	44	25	18	 But, when his accusers stood up, they did not charge him with the misdemeanours of which I had been suspecting him.
27816	44	25	19	 But they quarrelled with him about certain matters connected with their own religion, and about one Jesus who had died, but--so Paul persistently maintained--is now alive.
27817	44	25	20	 I was at a loss how to investigate such questions, and asked Paul whether he would care to go to Jerusalem and there stand his trial on these matters.
27818	44	25	21	 But when Paul appealed to have his case kept for the Emperor's decision, I ordered him to be kept in prison until I could send him up to Caesar."
27819	44	25	22	 "I should like to hear the man myself," said Agrippa. "to-morrow," replied Festus, "you shall." Accordingly, the next day, Agrippa and Bernice came in state
27820	44	25	23	 and took their seats in the Judgement Hall, attended by the Tribunes and the men of high rank in the city; and, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.
27821	44	25	24	 Then Festus said, "King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see here the man about whom the whole nation of the Jews made suit to me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying out that he ought not to live any longer.
27822	44	25	25	 I could not discover that he had done anything for which he deserved to die; but as he has himself appealed to the Emperor, I have decided to send him to Rome.
27823	44	25	26	 I have nothing very definite, however, to tell our Sovereign about him. So I have brought the man before you all--and especially before you, King Agrippa--that after he has been examined I may find something which I can put into writing.
27824	44	25	27	 For, when sending a prisoner to Rome, it seems to me to be absurd not to state the charges against him."
27825	44	26	1	 Then Agrippa said to Paul, "You have permission to speak about yourself." So Paul, with outstretched arm, proceeded to make his defence.
27826	44	26	2	 "As regards all the accusations brought against me by the Jews," he said,  "I think myself fortunate, King Agrippa, in being about to defend myself to-day before  you,
27827	44	26	3	 who are so familiar with all the customs and speculations that prevail among the Jews; and for this reason, I pray you, give me a patient hearing.
27828	44	26	4	 "The kind of life I have lived from my youth upwards, as exemplified in my early days among my nation and in Jerusalem, is known to all the Jews.
27829	44	26	5	 For they all know me of old--if they would but testify to the fact--how, being an adherent of the strictest sect of our religion, my life was that of a Pharisee.
27830	44	26	6	 And now I stand here impeached  because of my hope in the fulfilment of the promise made by God to our forefathers--
27831	44	26	7	 the promise which our twelve tribes, worshipping day and night with intense devotedness, hope to have made good to them. It is on the subject of this hope,  Sir, that I am accused by the Jews.
27832	44	26	8	 Why is it deemed with all of you a thing past belief if God raises the dead to life?
27833	44	26	9	 "I myself, however, thought it a duty to do many things in hostility to the name of Jesus, the Nazarene.
27834	44	26	10	 And that was how I acted in Jerusalem. Armed with authority received from the High Priests I shut up many of  God's people in various prisons, and when they were about to be put to death I gave my vote against them.
27835	44	26	11	 In all the synagogues also I punished them many a time, and tried to make them blaspheme; and in my wild fury I chased them even to foreign towns.
27836	44	26	12	 "While thus engaged, I was travelling one day to Damascus armed with authority and a commission from the High Priests,
27837	44	26	13	 and on the journey, at noon, Sir, I saw a light from Heaven--brighter than the brightness of the sun--shining around me and around those who were travelling with me.
27838	44	26	14	 We all fell to the ground; and I heard a voice which said to me in Hebrew, "`Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? You are finding it painful to kick against the ox-goad.'
27839	44	26	15	 "`Who art Thou, Lord?' I asked. "`I am Jesus whom you are persecuting,' the Lord replied.
27840	44	26	16	 `But rise, and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for the very purpose of appointing you My servant and My witness both as to the things you have already seen and as to those in which I will appear to you.
27841	44	26	17	 I will save you from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles,  to whom I send you to open their eyes,
27842	44	26	18	 that they may turn from darkness to light and from the obedience to Satan to God, in order to receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified through faith in Me.'
27843	44	26	19	 "Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision;
27844	44	26	20	 but I proceeded to preach first to the people in Damascus, and then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judaea, and to the Gentiles, that they must repent and turn to God, and live lives consistent with such repentance.
27845	44	26	21	 "It was on this account that the Jews seized me in the Temple and tried to kill me.
27846	44	26	22	 Having, however, obtained the help which is from God, I have stood firm until now, and have solemnly exhorted rich and poor alike, saying nothing except what the Prophets and Moses predicted as soon to happen,
27847	44	26	23	 since the Christ was to be a suffering Christ, and by coming back from the dead was then to be the first to proclaim a message of light both to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles."
27848	44	26	24	 As Paul thus made his defence, Festus exclaimed in a loud voice, "You are raving mad, Paul; and great learning is driving you mad."
27849	44	26	25	 "I am not mad, most noble Festus," replied Paul; "I am speaking words of sober truth.
27850	44	26	26	 For the King, to whom I speak freely, knows about these matters. I am not to be persuaded that any detail of them  has escaped his notice; for these things have not been done in a corner.
27851	44	26	27	 King Agrippa, do you believe the Prophets? I know that you believe them."
27852	44	26	28	 Agrippa answered,  "In brief, you are doing your best to persuade me to become a Christian."
27853	44	26	29	 "My prayer to God, whether  briefly or at length," replied Paul, "would be that not only you but all who are my hearers to-day, might become such as I am--except these chains."
27854	44	26	30	 So the King rose, and the Governor, and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them;
27855	44	26	31	 and, having withdrawn, they talked to one another and said, "This man is doing nothing for which he deserves death or imprisonment."
27856	44	26	32	 And Agrippa said to Festus, "He might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar."
27857	44	27	1	 Now when it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they handed over Paul and a few other prisoners into the custody of Julius, a Captain of the Augustan battalion;
27858	44	27	2	 and going on board a ship of Adramyttium which was about to sail to the ports of the province of Asia, we put to sea; Aristarchus, the Macedonian, from Thessalonica, forming one of our party.
27859	44	27	3	 The next day we put in at Sidon. There Julius treated Paul with thoughtful kindness and allowed him to visit his friends and profit by their generous care.
27860	44	27	4	 Putting to sea again, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were  against us;
27861	44	27	5	 and, sailing the whole length of the sea that lies off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we reached  Myra in Lycia.
27862	44	27	6	 There Julius found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy, and put us on board of her.
27863	44	27	7	 It took several days of slow sailing for us to come with difficulty off Cnidus; from which point, as the wind did not allow us to get on in the direct course, we ran under the lee of Crete  by Salmone.
27864	44	27	8	 Then, coasting along with difficulty, we reached a place called `Fair Havens,' near the town of Lasea.
27865	44	27	9	  Our voyage thus far had occupied a considerable time, and the navigation being now unsafe and  the Fast also already over, Paul warned them.
27866	44	27	10	 "Sirs," he said, "I perceive that before long the voyage will be attended with danger and heavy loss, not only to the cargo and the ship but to our own lives also."
27867	44	27	11	 But Julius let himself be persuaded by the pilot and by the owner rather than by Paul's arguments;
27868	44	27	12	 and as the harbour was inconvenient for wintering in, the majority were in favour of putting out to sea, to try whether they could get to Phoenix--a harbour on the coast of Crete  facing north-east and south-east--to winter there.
27869	44	27	13	 And a light breeze from the south sprang up, so that they supposed they  were now sure of their purpose. So weighing anchor they ran along the coast of Crete, hugging the shore.
27870	44	27	14	 But it was not long before  a furious north-east wind, coming  down from the mountains,  burst upon us and carried the ship out of her course.
27871	44	27	15	 She was unable to make headway against the gale; so we gave up and let her drive.
27872	44	27	16	 Then we ran under the lee of a little island called  Cauda, where we managed with great difficulty to secure the boat;
27873	44	27	17	 and, after hoisting it on board, they used frapping-cables  to undergird the ship, and, as they were afraid of being driven on the Syrtis quicksands, they lowered the gear and  lay to.
27874	44	27	18	 But, as the storm was still violent, the next day they began to lighten the ship;
27875	44	27	19	 and, on the third day, with their own hands they threw the ship's spare gear overboard.
27876	44	27	20	 Then, when for several days neither sun nor stars were seen and the terrific gale still harassed us, the last ray of hope was now vanishing.
27877	44	27	21	 When for a long time they had taken but little food, Paul, standing up among them, said, "Sirs, you ought to have listened to me and not have sailed from Crete. You would then have escaped this suffering and loss.
27878	44	27	22	 But now take courage, for there will be no destruction of life among you, but of the ship only.
27879	44	27	23	 For there stood by my side, last night, an angel of the God to whom I belong, and whom also I worship,
27880	44	27	24	 and he said, "`Dismiss all fear, Paul, for you must stand before Caesar; and God has granted you the lives of all who are sailing with you.'
27881	44	27	25	 "Therefore, Sirs, take courage; for I believe God, and am convinced that things will happen exactly as I have been told.
27882	44	27	26	 But we are to be stranded on a certain island."
27883	44	27	27	 It was now the fourteenth night, and we were  drifting through  the Sea of Adria, when, about midnight, the sailors suspected that land was close at hand.
27884	44	27	28	 So they hove the lead and found twenty fathoms of water; and after a short time they hove again and found fifteen fathoms.
27885	44	27	29	 Then for fear of possibly running on rocks, they threw out four anchors from the stern and  waited impatiently for daylight.
27886	44	27	30	 The sailors, however, wanted to make their escape from the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, pretending that they were going to lay out anchors from the bow.
27887	44	27	31	 But Paul, addressing Julius and the soldiers, said, "Your lives will be sacrificed, unless these men remain on board."
27888	44	27	32	 Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the ship's boat and let her fall off.
27889	44	27	33	 And continually, up till daybreak, Paul kept urging all on board to take some food. "This is the fourteenth day," he said, "that you have been anxiously waiting for the storm to cease, and have fasted, eating little or nothing.
27890	44	27	34	 I therefore strongly advise you to take some food. This is essential for your safety. For not a hair will perish from the head of any one of you."
27891	44	27	35	 Having said this he took some bread, and, after giving thanks to God for it before them all, he broke it in pieces and began to eat it.
27892	44	27	36	 This raised the spirits of all, and they too took food.
27893	44	27	37	 There were  276 of us, crew and passengers, all told.
27894	44	27	38	 After eating a hearty meal they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat overboard.
27895	44	27	39	 When daylight came, they tried in vain to recognise the coast. But an inlet with a sandy beach attracted their attention, and now  their object was, if possible, to run the ship aground  in this inlet.
27896	44	27	40	 So they cut away the anchors and left them in the sea, unloosing at the same time the bands which secured the  paddle-rudders. Then, hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.
27897	44	27	41	 But coming to a place where two seas met, they stranded the ship, and her bow sticking fast remained immovable, while the stern began to go to pieces under the heavy hammering of the sea.
27898	44	27	42	 Now the soldiers recommended that the prisoners should be killed, for fear some one of them might swim ashore and effect his escape.
27899	44	27	43	 But their Captain, bent on securing Paul's safety, kept them from their purpose and gave orders that those who could swim should first jump overboard and get to land;
27900	44	27	44	 and that the rest should follow, some on planks, and others on various things from the ship. In this way they all  got safely to land.
27901	44	28	1	 Our lives having been thus preserved, we discovered that the island was called  Malta.
27902	44	28	2	 The strange-speaking natives showed us remarkable kindness, for they lighted a fire and made us all welcome because of the pelting rain and the cold.
27903	44	28	3	 Now, when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and had thrown them on the fire, a viper, driven by the heat, came out and fastened itself on his hand.
27904	44	28	4	 When the natives saw the creature hanging to his hand, they said to one another, "Beyond doubt this man is a murderer, for, though saved from the sea, unerring Justice does not permit him to live."
27905	44	28	5	 He, however, shook the reptile off into the fire and was unhurt.
27906	44	28	6	 They expected him soon to swell with inflammation or suddenly fall down dead; but, after waiting a long time and seeing no harm come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.
27907	44	28	7	 Now in the same part of the island there were estates belonging to the Governor, whose name was Publius. He welcomed us to his house, and for three days generously made us his guests.
27908	44	28	8	 It happened, however, that his father was lying ill of dysentery aggravated by attacks of fever; so Paul went to see him, and, after praying, laid his hands on him and cured him.
27909	44	28	9	 After this, all the other sick people in the island came and were cured.
27910	44	28	10	 They also loaded us with honours, and when at last we sailed they put supplies on board for us.
27911	44	28	11	 Three months passed before we set sail in an Alexandrian vessel,  called the `Twin Brothers,' which had wintered at the island.
27912	44	28	12	 At Syracuse we put in and stayed for  two days.
27913	44	28	13	 From there we  came round and reached Rhegium; and a day later, a south wind sprang up which brought us by the evening of the next day to Puteoli.
27914	44	28	14	 Here we found brethren, who invited us to remain with them for a week; and so we reached Rome.
27915	44	28	15	 Meanwhile the brethren there, hearing of our movements, came as far as  the Market of Appius and the Three Huts to meet us; and when Paul saw them he thanked God and felt encouraged.
27916	44	28	16	 Upon our arrival  in Rome, Paul received permission to live  by himself, guarded by a soldier.
27917	44	28	17	 After  one complete day he invited the leading men among the Jews to meet him; and, when they were come together, he said to them, "As for me, brethren, although I had done nothing prejudicial to our people or contrary to the customs of our forefathers, I was handed over as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the power of the Romans.
27918	44	28	18	 They, after they had sharply questioned me, were willing to set me at liberty, because they found no offence in me for which I deserve to die.
27919	44	28	19	 But,  at last, the opposition of the Jews compelled me to appeal to Caesar; not however that I had any charge to bring against my nation.
27920	44	28	20	 For these reasons, then, I have invited you here, that I might see you and speak to you; for it is for the sake of  Him who is the hope of Israel that this chain hangs  upon me."
27921	44	28	21	 "For our part," they replied, "we have not received any letters from Judaea about you, nor have any of our countrymen come here and reported or stated anything to your disadvantage.
27922	44	28	22	 But we should be glad to hear from you what it is that you believe; for as for this sect all we know is that it is everywhere spoken against."
27923	44	28	23	 So they arranged a day with him and came to him in  considerable numbers  at the house of the friends who were entertaining him. And then, with solemn earnestness, he explained to them the subject of the Kingdom of God, endeavouring from morning till evening to convince them about Jesus, both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets.
27924	44	28	24	 Some were convinced; others refused to believe.
27925	44	28	25	 Unable to agree among themselves, they at last left him, but not before Paul had spoken a parting word to them, saying, "Right well did the Holy Spirit say to your forefathers through the Prophet Isaiah:
27926	44	28	26	 <"`Go to this people and tell them, you will hear and hear, and by no means understand; and will look and look, and by no means see.
27927	44	28	27	 For this people's mind has grown callous, their hearing has become dull, and their eyes they have closed; to prevent their ever seeing with their eyes, or hearing with their ears, or understanding with their minds, and turning back, so that I might cure them.'>
27928	44	28	28	 "Be fully assured, therefore, that this salvation--God's salvation--has now been sent to the Gentiles, and that they, at any rate, will give heed."
27929	44	28	29	  []
27930	44	28	30	 After this Paul lived for fully two years in a hired house of his own, receiving all who came to see him.
27931	44	28	31	 He announced the coming of the Kingdom of God, and taught concerning the Lord Jesus Christ without let or hindrance.
27932	45	1	1	 Paul, a bondservant of Jesus Christ,  called to be an Apostle, set apart to proclaim God's Good News,
27933	45	1	2	 which God had already promised through His Prophets in Holy Writ, concerning His Son,
27934	45	1	3	 who, as regards His human descent, belonged to the posterity of David,
27935	45	1	4	 but as regards the holiness of His Spirit was decisively proved by His Resurrection to be the Son of God--I mean concerning Jesus Christ our Lord,
27936	45	1	5	 through whom we have received  grace and Apostleship in His service in order  to win men to obedience to the faith, among all Gentile peoples,
27937	45	1	6	 among whom you also,  called, as you have been, to belong to Jesus Christ, are numbered:
27938	45	1	7	 To all  God's loved ones who are in Rome, called  to be saints. May grace and peace be granted to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
27939	45	1	8	 First of all, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for what He has done for all of you; for the report of your faith is spreading through the whole world.
27940	45	1	9	 I call God to witness--to whom I render priestly and spiritual service by telling the Good News about His Son--  how unceasingly I make mention of you in His presence,
27941	45	1	10	 always in my prayers entreating that now, at length, if such be His will, the way may by some means be made clear for me to come to you.
27942	45	1	11	 For I am longing to see you, in order to convey to you some spiritual help, so that you may be strengthened;
27943	45	1	12	 in other words that while I am among you we may be mutually encouraged by one another's faith, yours and mine.
27944	45	1	13	 And I desire you to know, brethren, that I have many a time intended to come to you--though until now I have been disappointed--in order that among you also I might gather some fruit from my labours, as I have already done among the rest of the Gentile nations.
27945	45	1	14	 I  am already under obligations alike to Greek-speaking races and to others, to cultured and to uncultured people:
27946	45	1	15	 so that for my part I am willing and eager to proclaim the Good News to you also who are in Rome.
27947	45	1	16	 For I am not ashamed of the Good News. It is God's power which is at work for the salvation of every one who believes--the Jew first, and then the  Gentile.
27948	45	1	17	 For in the Good News  a righteousness which comes from God is being revealed, depending on faith and tending to produce faith; as the Scripture has it,  <"The righteous man shall live by faith.">
27949	45	1	18	 For God's anger is being revealed from Heaven against all impiety and against the iniquity of men who through iniquity suppress the truth. God is angry:
27950	45	1	19	 because what may be known about Him is plain  to their inmost consciousness; for He Himself has made it plain to them.
27951	45	1	20	 For, from the very creation of the world, His invisible perfections--namely His eternal power and divine nature--have been rendered intelligible and clearly visible by His works,  so that these men are without excuse.
27952	45	1	21	 For when they had come to know God, they did not give Him glory as God nor render Him thanks, but they became absorbed in useless discussions, and their senseless minds were darkened.
27953	45	1	22	 While boasting of their wisdom they became  utter fools,
27954	45	1	23	 and,  instead of worshipping the imperishable God, they worshipped images resembling perishable man or resembling birds or beasts or reptiles.
27955	45	1	24	 For this reason, in accordance with  their own depraved cravings, God gave them up to uncleanness, allowing them to dishonour their bodies among themselves with impurity.
27956	45	1	25	 For they had bartered the reality of God for  what is unreal, and had offered divine honours and religious service to created things, rather than to the Creator--He who is for ever blessed. Amen.
27957	45	1	26	 This then is the reason why God gave them up to vile passions. For not only did the women among them exchange the natural use of their bodies for one which is contrary to nature, but the men also,
27958	45	1	27	 in just the same way--neglecting that for which nature intends women--burned with passion towards one another, men practising shameful vice with men, and receiving in their own selves the reward which necessarily followed their misconduct.
27959	45	1	28	 And just as they had refused to continue to have a full knowledge of God, so it was to utterly worthless minds that God gave them up, for them to do things which should not be done.
27960	45	1	29	 Their hearts overflowed with all sorts of dishonesty, mischief, greed,  malice. They were full of envy and murder, and were quarrelsome, crafty, and spiteful.
27961	45	1	30	 They were secret backbiters, open slanderers;  hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful; inventors of new forms of sin, disobedient to parents, destitute of common sense,
27962	45	1	31	 faithless to their promises, without natural affection, without human pity.
27963	45	1	32	 In short, though knowing full well the sentence which God pronounces against  actions such as theirs, as things which deserve death, they not only  practise them, but even  encourage and applaud others who do them.
27964	45	2	1	 You are therefore without excuse, O man,  whoever you are who  sit in judgement upon others. For when you  pass judgement on your fellow man, you condemn yourself; for you who sit in judgement upon others are guilty of the same misdeeds;
27965	45	2	2	 and we know that God's judgement  against those who commit such sins is in accordance with the truth.
27966	45	2	3	 And you who pronounce judgement upon those who do such things although your own conduct is the same as theirs--do you imagine that you yourself will escape unpunished when God judges?
27967	45	2	4	 Or is it that you think slightingly of  His infinite goodness, forbearance and patience, unaware that the goodness of God is gently drawing you to repentance?
27968	45	2	5	 The fact is that in the stubbornness of your impenitent heart you are treasuring up against yourself anger on the day of Anger--the day when the righteousness of God's judgements will stand revealed.
27969	45	2	6	 <To each man He will make an award corresponding to his actions;>
27970	45	2	7	 to those on the one hand who, by lives of persistent right-doing, are striving for glory, honour and immortality, the Life of the Ages;
27971	45	2	8	 while on the other hand upon the self-willed who disobey the truth and obey unrighteousness will fall anger and fury,  affliction and awful distress,
27972	45	2	9	 coming upon the soul of every  man and woman who deliberately does wrong--upon the Jew first, and then upon the  Gentile;
27973	45	2	10	 whereas glory, honour and peace will be given to every one who does what is good and right--to the Jew first and then to the Gentile.
27974	45	2	11	  For God pays no attention to this world's distinctions.
27975	45	2	12	 For all who  have sinned  apart from the Law will also perish apart from the Law, and all who have sinned whilst living  under the Law, will be judged by the Law.
27976	45	2	13	 It is not those that merely  hear the Law  read who are righteous in the sight of God, but it is those that obey the Law who will be pronounced righteous.
27977	45	2	14	 For when Gentiles who have no Law obey by natural instinct the commands of the Law, they, without having a Law, are a Law to themselves;
27978	45	2	15	 since they exhibit proof that  a knowledge of the conduct which the Law requires is engraven on their hearts, while their consciences also bear witness to the Law, and their thoughts, as if in mutual discussion, accuse them or perhaps maintain their innocence--
27979	45	2	16	 on the day when God will judge the secrets of men's lives  by Jesus Christ, as declared in the Good News as I have taught it.
27980	45	2	17	 And since you claim the name of Jew, and find  rest and satisfaction in the Law, and make your boast in God,
27981	45	2	18	 and know the supreme will, and  can test things that differ--being a man who receives instruction from the Law--
27982	45	2	19	 and have persuaded yourself that, as for you, you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
27983	45	2	20	 a schoolmaster for the dull and ignorant, a teacher of the young, because in the Law you possess  an outline of  real knowledge and an outline of the truth:
27984	45	2	21	 you then who teach your fellow man, do you refuse to teach yourself? You who cry out against stealing, are you yourself a thief?
27985	45	2	22	 You who forbid adultery, do you commit adultery? You who loathe idols, do you plunder their temples?
27986	45	2	23	 You who make your boast in the Law, do you offend against its commands and so dishonour God?
27987	45	2	24	 <For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentile nations because of you,> as Holy Writ declares.
27988	45	2	25	 Circumcision does indeed profit, if you obey the Law; but if you are a Law-breaker, the fact that you have been circumcised counts for nothing.
27989	45	2	26	 In the same way if an uncircumcised man pays attention to the just requirements of the Law, shall not his lack of circumcision  be overlooked, and,
27990	45	2	27	  although he is a Gentile by birth, if he scrupulously obeys the Law, shall he not sit in judgement upon you who, possessing, as you do, a written Law and circumcision, are yet a Law-breaker?
27991	45	2	28	 For the true Jew is not the man who is simply a Jew outwardly, and true circumcision is not that which is outward and bodily.
27992	45	2	29	 But the true Jew is one inwardly, and true circumcision is heart-circumcision--not literal, but spiritual; and such people receive praise not from men, but from God.
27993	45	3	1	 What special privilege, then, has a Jew? Or what benefit is to be derived from circumcision?
27994	45	3	2	 The privilege is great from every point of view. First of all, because the Jews were entrusted with  God's truth.
27995	45	3	3	 For what if some Jews have proved  unfaithful? Shall their faithlessness render God's faithfulness worthless?
27996	45	3	4	  No, indeed; let us hold God to be true, though every man should prove to be false. As it stands written, <"That Thou mayest be shown to be just in  the sentence Thou pronouncest, and gain Thy cause  when Thou contendest.">
27997	45	3	5	 But if our unrighteousness  sets God's righteousness in a clearer light, what shall we say? (Is God unrighteous--I speak in our everyday language-- when He inflicts punishment?
27998	45	3	6	 No indeed; for in that case how shall He judge all mankind?)
27999	45	3	7	 If,  for instance, a falsehood of mine has made God's truthfulness more conspicuous, redounding to His glory, why am I judged all the same as a sinner?
28000	45	3	8	 And why should we not say--for so they wickedly misrepresent us, and so some charge us with arguing--"Let us do evil that good may come"? The condemnation  of those who would so argue is just.
28001	45	3	9	 What then? Are we Jews more highly  estimated than they? Not in the least; for we have already charged all Jews and Gentiles alike with being in thraldom to sin.
28002	45	3	10	 Thus it stands written, <"There is not one righteous man.
28003	45	3	11	 There is not one who is really wise, nor one who is a diligent seeker after God.
28004	45	3	12	 All have turned aside from the right path; they have every one of them become corrupt. There is no one who does what is right--no, not so much as one."
28005	45	3	13	 "Their throats resemble an opened grave; with their tongues they have been talking deceitfully." "The venom of vipers lies hidden  behind their lips."
28006	45	3	14	 "Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness."
28007	45	3	15	 "Their feet move swiftly to shed blood.
28008	45	3	16	  Ruin and misery mark their path;
28009	45	3	17	 and the way to peace they have not known."
28010	45	3	18	 "There is no fear of God before their eyes.">
28011	45	3	19	 But it cannot be denied that all that the Law says is addressed to those who are living under the Law, in order that  every mouth may be stopped, and that the whole world may await sentence from God.
28012	45	3	20	 For on the ground of obedience to Law no man living will be declared righteous before Him. Law simply brings a sure knowledge of sin.
28013	45	3	21	 But now a righteousness coming from God has been brought to light apart from any Law, both Law and Prophets bearing witness to it--
28014	45	3	22	 a righteousness coming from God,  which depends on faith in Jesus Christ and extends  to all who believe. No distinction is made;
28015	45	3	23	 for all alike have sinned, and all  consciously come short of the glory of God,
28016	45	3	24	 gaining acquittal from guilt by His free unpurchased grace through the  deliverance which is found in Christ Jesus.
28017	45	3	25	 He it is whom God put forward as  a Mercy-seat, rendered efficacious through faith in His blood, in order to demonstrate His righteousness--  because of the passing over, in God's forbearance, of the sins previously committed--
28018	45	3	26	 with a view to demonstrating, at the present time, His righteousness, that He may  be shown to be righteous Himself, and the giver of righteousness to those who believe in Jesus.
28019	45	3	27	 Where then is there room for your boasting? It is  for ever shut out.  On what principle? On the ground of merit? No, but on the ground of faith.
28020	45	3	28	  For we maintain that it is as the result of faith that a man is held to be righteous, apart from actions done in obedience to Law.
28021	45	3	29	 Is God simply the God of the Jews, and not of the Gentiles also? He is certainly the God of the Gentiles also,
28022	45	3	30	 unless you can deny that it is one and the same God who will pronounce the circumcised to be acquitted on the ground of faith, and the uncircumcised to be acquitted through the same faith.
28023	45	3	31	 Do we then by means of this faith abolish  the Law? No, indeed; we give  the Law a firmer footing.
28024	45	4	1	 What then shall we say  that Abraham, our earthly forefather, has gained?
28025	45	4	2	 For if he was held to be righteous on the ground of his actions, he has something to boast of; but not  in the presence of God.
28026	45	4	3	 For what says the Scripture? <"And Abraham believed God, and  this was placed to his credit as righteousness.">
28027	45	4	4	 But in the case of a man who works, pay is not reckoned a favour but a debt;
28028	45	4	5	 whereas in the case of a man who pleads no actions of his own, but simply  believes in Him who declares the ungodly free from guilt, his faith is placed to his credit as righteousness.
28029	45	4	6	 In this way David also  tells of the blessedness of the man to whose credit God places righteousness, apart from his actions.
28030	45	4	7	 <"Blessed,"> he says, <"are those whose iniquities have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered over.
28031	45	4	8	 Blessed is the man of whose sin the Lord will not take account.">
28032	45	4	9	 This declaration of blessedness, then, does it come simply to the circumcised, or to the uncircumcised as well? For <Abraham's faith>--so we affirm--<was placed to his credit as righteousness.>
28033	45	4	10	 What then were the circumstances under which this took place? Was it after he had been circumcised, or before?
28034	45	4	11	 Before, not after. And he received  circumcision as a sign, a mark attesting the reality of the faith-righteousness which was his while still uncircumcised, that he might be the forefather of all those who believe even though they are uncircumcised--in order that this righteousness might be placed to their credit;
28035	45	4	12	 and the forefather of the circumcised, namely of those who not merely are circumcised, but also walk in the steps of the faith which our forefather Abraham had while he was as yet uncircumcised.
28036	45	4	13	  Again, the promise that he should inherit the world did not come to Abraham or his posterity conditioned by Law, but by faith-righteousness.
28037	45	4	14	 For if it is the righteous through Law who are heirs, then faith is useless and the promise counts for nothing.
28038	45	4	15	 For the Law inflicts  punishment; but where no Law exists, there can be no violation of Law.
28039	45	4	16	 All depends on faith, and for this reason--that  acceptance with God might be an act of pure grace,
28040	45	4	17	 so that the promise should be made sure to all Abraham's true descendants; not merely to those who are righteous through the Law, but to those who are righteous through a faith like that of Abraham. Thus in the sight of God in whom he believed, who gives life to  the dead and makes reference to things that do not exist, as though they did, Abraham is the forefather of  all of us. As it is written, <"I have appointed you to be the forefather of many nations.">
28041	45	4	18	 Under utterly hopeless circumstances he hopefully believed, so that he might become the forefather of many nations, in agreement with the words <"Equally numerous shall your posterity be.">
28042	45	4	19	 And, without growing weak in faith, he could contemplate his own vital powers which had now decayed--for he was nearly 100 years old--and Sarah's barrenness.
28043	45	4	20	 Nor did he in unbelief stagger at God's promise, but became mighty in faith, giving glory to God,
28044	45	4	21	 and being absolutely certain that whatever promise He is bound by He is able also to make good.
28045	45	4	22	 For this reason also his faith <was placed to his credit as righteousness.>
28046	45	4	23	 Nor was the fact of its being placed to his credit put on record for his sake only;
28047	45	4	24	 it was for our sakes too. Faith, before long, will be placed to the credit of us also who are believers in Him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead,
28048	45	4	25	 who was surrendered to death  because of the offences we had committed, and was raised to life  because of the  acquittal secured for us.
28049	45	5	1	 Standing then acquitted as the result of faith,  let us enjoy peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
28050	45	5	2	 through whom also,  as the result of faith, we have obtained  an introduction into that state of favour with God in which we stand, and we exult in hope of  some day sharing in God's glory.
28051	45	5	3	 And not only so:  we also exult in our sufferings, knowing as we do, that  suffering produces fortitude;
28052	45	5	4	 fortitude, ripeness of character; and ripeness of character, hope;
28053	45	5	5	 and that  this hope never disappoints, because God's love for us  floods our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given  to us.
28054	45	5	6	 For already, while we were still helpless, Christ at the right moment died for the ungodly.
28055	45	5	7	 Why, it is scarcely conceivable that any one would die for a simply just man, although for a good and lovable man perhaps some one, here and there, will have the courage even to lay down his life.
28056	45	5	8	 But God gives proof of His love to us in Christ's dying for us while we were still sinners.
28057	45	5	9	 If therefore we have now been pronounced free from guilt through His blood, much more shall we be delivered from  God's anger through Him.
28058	45	5	10	 For if while we were hostile to God we were reconciled to Him through the death of His Son, it is still more certain that now that we are reconciled, we shall obtain salvation through Christ's life.
28059	45	5	11	 And not only so, but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now obtained that reconciliation.
28060	45	5	12	 What follows? This comparison. Through one man sin entered into the world, and through sin death, and so death passed to all mankind in turn, in that all sinned.
28061	45	5	13	 For prior to the Law sin was already in the world; only it is not  entered in the account against us when no Law exists.
28062	45	5	14	 Yet Death reigned as king from Adam to Moses even over those who had not sinned, as Adam did, against Law. And in Adam we have a type of Him whose coming was still future.
28063	45	5	15	 But God's free gift immeasurably outweighs the  transgression. For if through the transgression of the one individual  the mass of mankind have died, infinitely greater is the generosity with which God's grace, and the gift given in His grace which found expression in the one man Jesus Christ, have been bestowed on the mass of mankind.
28064	45	5	16	 And it is not with the gift as it was with the results of one individual's sin; for the judgement which one individual provoked resulted in condemnation, whereas the free gift after a multitude of transgressions results in acquittal.
28065	45	5	17	 For if, through the transgression of the one individual, Death made use of the one individual to seize the sovereignty, all the more shall those who receive God's overflowing grace and gift of righteousness reign as kings in Life through the one individual, Jesus Christ.
28066	45	5	18	 It follows then that just as the result of a single transgression is a condemnation which extends to the whole race, so also the result of a single decree of righteousness is a  life-giving  acquittal which  extends to the whole race.
28067	45	5	19	 For as through the disobedience of the one individual the mass of mankind were constituted sinners, so also through the obedience of the One the mass of mankind will be constituted righteous.
28068	45	5	20	 Now Law was brought in later on, so  that transgression might increase. But where sin increased, grace  has overflowed;
28069	45	5	21	 in order that as sin has exercised kingly sway in inflicting death, so grace, too,  may exercise kingly sway in bestowing a righteousness which results in the Life of the Ages through Jesus Christ our Lord.
28070	45	6	1	 To what conclusion, then, shall we come? Are we to persist in sinning in order that the grace extended to us may be the greater?
28071	45	6	2	 No, indeed; how shall we who have died to sin, live in it any longer?
28072	45	6	3	 And do you not know that all of us who have been baptized  into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?
28073	45	6	4	 Well, then,  we by our baptism were buried with Him  in death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from among the dead by the Father's  glorious power, we also should live an entirely new life.
28074	45	6	5	 For since we have become one with Him  by sharing in His death, we shall also be one with Him  by sharing in His resurrection.
28075	45	6	6	 This we know--that our old self was nailed to the cross with Him, in order that our sinful nature might be deprived of its power, so that we should no longer be the slaves of sin;
28076	45	6	7	 for he who  has paid the penalty of death  stands absolved from his sin.
28077	45	6	8	 But, seeing that we  have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him;
28078	45	6	9	 because we know that Christ, having come back to life, is no longer liable to die.
28079	45	6	10	 Death has no longer any power over Him. For by the death which He died He became, once for all, dead in relation to sin; but by the life which He now lives  He is alive in relation to God.
28080	45	6	11	 In the same way you also must regard yourselves as dead in relation to sin, but as alive in relation to God, because you are in Christ Jesus.
28081	45	6	12	 Let not Sin therefore reign as king in your mortal bodies, causing you to be in subjection to their cravings;
28082	45	6	13	 and no longer lend your faculties as unrighteous  weapons for Sin to use. On the contrary surrender your very selves to God  as living men who have risen from the dead, and surrender your several faculties to God, to be used as weapons to maintain the right.
28083	45	6	14	 For Sin shall not be lord over you, since you are subjects not of Law, but of grace.
28084	45	6	15	 Are we therefore to sin because we are no longer under the authority of Law, but under grace? No, indeed!
28085	45	6	16	 Do you not know that if you surrender yourselves as bondservants to obey any one, you  become the bondservants of him whom you obey, whether the bondservants of Sin (with death as the result) or of Duty (resulting in righteousness)?
28086	45	6	17	 But thanks be to God that though you were once in thraldom to Sin, you  have now yielded a hearty obedience to that  system of truth in which you have been  instructed.
28087	45	6	18	 You were set free from the tyranny of Sin, and became the bondservants of Righteousness--
28088	45	6	19	 your human infirmity leads me to employ these familiar figures--and just as you once surrendered your faculties into bondage to Impurity and ever-increasing disregard of Law, so you must now surrender them into bondage to Righteousness ever advancing towards perfect holiness.
28089	45	6	20	 For when you were the bondservants of sin, you were under no sort of subjection to Righteousness.
28090	45	6	21	 At that time, then, what benefit did you get from conduct which you now regard with shame? Why, such things finally result in death.
28091	45	6	22	 But now that you have been set free from the tyranny of Sin, and have become the bondservants of God, you have your reward in being made holy, and you have the Life of the Ages as the final result.
28092	45	6	23	 For the wages paid by Sin are death; but God's free gift is the Life of the Ages bestowed upon us in Christ Jesus our Lord.
28093	45	7	1	 Brethren, do you not know--for I am writing to people acquainted with the Law--that it is during our lifetime that we are subject to the Law?
28094	45	7	2	 A wife, for instance, whose husband is living is bound to him by the Law; but if her husband dies  the law that bound her to him has now no hold over her.
28095	45	7	3	 This accounts for the fact that if during her husband's life she lives with another man, she will be stigmatized as an adulteress; but that if her husband is dead she is  no longer under the old prohibition, and even though she marries again, she is not an adulteress.
28096	45	7	4	 So, my brethren,  to  you also the Law died through the  incarnation of Christ, that you might be wedded to Another, namely to Him who rose from the dead in order that  we might yield fruit to God.
28097	45	7	5	 For whilst we were under the thraldom of our earthly natures, sinful passions--  made sinful by the Law--were always  being aroused to action in our bodily faculties that they might yield fruit to death.
28098	45	7	6	 But seeing that we have died to that which once held us in bondage,  the Law has now no hold over us, so that we render a service which, instead of being old and  formal, is new and spiritual.
28099	45	7	7	 What follows? Is the Law itself a sinful thing? No, indeed; on the contrary, unless I had been taught by the Law, I  should have known nothing of sin as sin. For instance, I should not have known what covetousness is, if the Law had not  repeatedly said, <"Thou shalt not covet.">
28100	45	7	8	 Sin took advantage of this, and by means of  the Commandment stirred up within me  every kind of coveting; for apart from Law sin would be dead.
28101	45	7	9	 Once, apart from Law, I was alive, but when the Commandment came, sin  sprang into life, and I died;
28102	45	7	10	 and, as it turned out, the very Commandment which was to bring me life, brought me death.
28103	45	7	11	 For sin seized the advantage, and by means of the Commandment it completely deceived me, and  also put me to death.
28104	45	7	12	 So that the Law itself is holy, and the Commandment is holy, just and good.
28105	45	7	13	 Did then a thing which is good become death to me? No, indeed, but sin did; so that through its bringing about death by means of what was good, it might be seen in its true light as sin, in order that by means of the Commandment the unspeakable sinfulness of sin might be plainly shown.
28106	45	7	14	 For we know that the Law is a spiritual thing; but I am unspiritual--the slave, bought and sold, of sin.
28107	45	7	15	 For what I do,  I do not recognize as my own action. What I desire to do is not what I do, but what I am averse to is what I do.
28108	45	7	16	 But if I do that which I do not desire to do, I admit the excellence of the Law,
28109	45	7	17	 and now it is no longer I that do these things, but the sin which has its home within me does them.
28110	45	7	18	 For I know that in me, that is, in my  lower self, nothing good has its home; for while the will to do right  is present with me, the power to carry it out is not.
28111	45	7	19	 For what I do is not the good thing that I desire to do; but the evil thing that I desire not to do, is what I constantly do.
28112	45	7	20	 But if I do that which I desire not to do, it can no longer be said that it is I who do it, but the sin which has its home within me does it.
28113	45	7	21	 I find therefore the  law of my nature to be that when I desire to do what is right, evil is  lying in ambush for me.
28114	45	7	22	 For in my inmost self all my sympathy is with the Law of God;
28115	45	7	23	 but I discover within me  a different Law at war with the Law of my understanding, and leading me captive to the Law which  is everywhere at work in my body--the Law of sin.
28116	45	7	24	 (Unhappy man that I am! who will rescue me from this death-burdened body?
28117	45	7	25	 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!) To sum up then, with my understanding, I--my true self--am in servitude to the Law of God, but with my lower nature I am in servitude to the Law of sin.
28118	45	8	1	 There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus;
28119	45	8	2	 for the Spirit's Law--  telling of Life in Christ Jesus--has set  me free from the Law that deals only with sin and death.
28120	45	8	3	 For what was impossible to the Law--powerless as it was because it acted through frail  humanity--God effected. Sending His own Son in a body like that of sinful  human nature and as a sacrifice for sin, He  pronounced  sentence upon sin in human nature;
28121	45	8	4	 in order that in our case the requirements of the Law might be fully met. For our lives are regulated not by our earthly, but by our spiritual natures.
28122	45	8	5	 For if men are controlled by their earthly natures, they give their minds to earthly things. If they are controlled by their spiritual natures, they give their minds to spiritual things.
28123	45	8	6	 Because for the mind to be given up to earthly things means death; but for it to be given up to spiritual things means Life and peace.
28124	45	8	7	 Abandonment to earthly things is a state of enmity to God. Such a mind does not submit to God's Law, and indeed cannot do so.
28125	45	8	8	 And those whose hearts are absorbed in earthly things cannot please God.
28126	45	8	9	 You, however, are not devoted to earthly, but to spiritual things, if the Spirit of God is really dwelling in you; whereas if any man has not the Spirit of Christ, such a one does not belong to Him.
28127	45	8	10	 But if Christ is in you, though your body must die  because of sin, yet your spirit has Life because of righteousness.
28128	45	8	11	 And if the Spirit of Him who raised up Jesus from the dead is dwelling in you, He who raised up Christ from the dead will give Life also to your mortal bodies  because of His Spirit who dwells in you.
28129	45	8	12	 Therefore, brethren, it is not to our lower natures that we are under obligation that we should live by their rule.
28130	45	8	13	 For if you so live, death is near; but if, through being under the sway of  the spirit, you are putting  your old bodily habits to death, you will live.
28131	45	8	14	 For those who are led by God's Spirit are, all of them, God's sons.
28132	45	8	15	 You have not for the second time acquired the consciousness of being--a consciousness which fills you with terror. But you have acquired a deep inward conviction of having been adopted as sons--a conviction which prompts us to cry aloud, "Abba! our Father!"
28133	45	8	16	 The Spirit Himself bears witness, along with our own spirits, to the fact that we are children of God;
28134	45	8	17	 and if children, then heirs too--heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ; if indeed we are sharers in Christ's sufferings, in order that we may also be sharers in His glory.
28135	45	8	18	 Why, what we now suffer I count as nothing in comparison with the glory which is soon to be manifested in us.
28136	45	8	19	 For all creation, gazing eagerly as if with outstretched neck, is waiting and longing to see the manifestation of the sons of God.
28137	45	8	20	 For the Creation  fell into subjection to failure and unreality (not of its own choice, but by the will of Him who so subjected it).
28138	45	8	21	 Yet there was always the hope that at last the Creation itself would also be set free from the thraldom of decay so as to enjoy the liberty that will attend the glory of the children of God.
28139	45	8	22	 For we know that the whole of Creation is groaning together in the pains of childbirth until this hour.
28140	45	8	23	 And more than that,  we ourselves, though we possess the Spirit as a foretaste and pledge of the glorious future, yet we ourselves inwardly sigh, as we wait and long for open recognition as sons through the  deliverance of our bodies.
28141	45	8	24	 It is *in hope* that we have been saved. But  an object of hope is such no longer when it is present to view;  for when a man has a thing before his eyes, how can he be said to hope for it?
28142	45	8	25	 But if we hope for something which we do not see, then we eagerly and patiently wait for it.
28143	45	8	26	 In the same way the Spirit also helps us in our weakness; for we do not know what prayers to offer nor in what way to offer them. But the Spirit Himself pleads for us in yearnings that can find no words,
28144	45	8	27	 and the Searcher of hearts knows what the Spirit's meaning is,  because His intercessions for God's people are in harmony with God's will.
28145	45	8	28	 Now we know that for those who love God  all things are working together for good--for those, I mean, whom with deliberate purpose He has called.
28146	45	8	29	 For those whom He has  known beforehand He has also pre-destined to bear the likeness of His Son, that He might be the Eldest in a vast family of brothers;
28147	45	8	30	 and those whom He has pre-destined He also has called; and those whom He has called He has also declared free from guilt; and those whom He has declared free from guilt He has also crowned with glory.
28148	45	8	31	 What then shall we say to this? If God is on our side, who is there to appear against us?
28149	45	8	32	 He who did not withhold even His own Son, but gave Him up for all of us, will He not also with Him freely give us all things?
28150	45	8	33	 Who shall impeach those whom God has chosen?  God declares them free from guilt.
28151	45	8	34	 Who is there to condemn them? Christ  Jesus died, or rather has risen to life again.  He is also at the right hand of God, and is interceding for us.
28152	45	8	35	 Who shall separate us from Christ's love? Shall affliction or distress, persecution or hunger, nakedness or danger or the sword?
28153	45	8	36	 As it stands written in the Scripture, <"For Thy sake they are, all day long, trying to kill us. We have been looked upon as sheep destined for slaughter.">
28154	45	8	37	 Yet amid all these things we are  more than conquerors through Him who has loved us.
28155	45	8	38	 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither the lower ranks of evil angels nor the higher, neither things present nor  things future, nor the  forces of nature,
28156	45	8	39	 nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God which rests upon us in Christ Jesus our Lord.
28157	45	9	1	 I am telling you the truth as a Christian man--it is no falsehood, for my conscience enlightened, as it is, by the Holy Spirit adds its testimony to mine--
28158	45	9	2	 when I declare that I have deep grief and unceasing anguish of heart.
28159	45	9	3	 For  I could pray to be  accursed from Christ on behalf of my brethren, my human kinsfolk--for such the Israelites are.
28160	45	9	4	 To them belongs recognition as God's sons, and they have His glorious Presence and the Covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the Temple service, and  the ancient Promises.
28161	45	9	5	 To them the Patriarchs belong, and from them in respect of His human lineage came the Christ, who is exalted above all, God blessed throughout the Ages. Amen.
28162	45	9	6	 Not however that God's word has failed; for all who have sprung from Israel do not count as Israel,
28163	45	9	7	 nor because they are Abraham's true children. But the promise was <"Through Isaac shall your posterity be reckoned.">
28164	45	9	8	 In other words, it is not the children by natural descent who count as God's children, but the children made such by the promise are regarded as Abraham's posterity.
28165	45	9	9	 For the words are the language of promise and run thus, <"About this time next year I will come, and Sarah shall have a son.">
28166	45	9	10	 Nor is that all:  later on there was Rebecca too. She was soon to bear two children to her husband, our forefather Isaac--
28167	45	9	11	 and even then, though they were not then born and had not done anything either good or evil, yet in order that God's electing purpose might not be frustrated, based, as it was, not on their actions but on the will of Him who called them, she was told,
28168	45	9	12	 <"The elder of them will be bondservant to the younger.">
28169	45	9	13	 This agrees with the other Scripture which says, <"Jacob I  have loved, but Esau I  have hated.">
28170	45	9	14	 What then are we to infer? That there is injustice in God?
28171	45	9	15	 No, indeed; the solution is found in His words to Moses, <"Wherever I show mercy it shall be nothing but mercy, and wherever I show compassion it shall be simply compassion.">
28172	45	9	16	 And from this we learn that everything  is dependent not on man's will or  endeavour, but upon God who has mercy. For the Scripture said to Pharaoh,
28173	45	9	17	 <"It is for this very purpose that I have lifted you so high--that I may make manifest in you My power, and that My name may be proclaimed far and wide in all the earth.">
28174	45	9	18	 This is a proof that wherever He chooses He shows mercy, and wherever he chooses He  hardens the heart.
28175	45	9	19	 "Why then does God still find fault?" you will ask; "for who is resisting His will?"
28176	45	9	20	 Nay, but who are you,  a mere man, that you should cavil against GOD? <Shall the thing moulded say to him who moulded it, "Why have you made me thus?">
28177	45	9	21	 Or has not the potter rightful power over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel for more honourable and another for less honourable uses?
28178	45	9	22	 And what if God, while choosing to make manifest the terrors of His anger and to show what is possible with Him, has yet borne with long-forbearing patience with the subjects of His anger who  stand ready for destruction,
28179	45	9	23	  in order to make known  His infinite goodness towards the subjects of His mercy whom He has  prepared beforehand for glory,
28180	45	9	24	 even towards us whom He has called not only from among the Jews but also from among the Gentiles?
28181	45	9	25	 So also in Hosea He says, <"I will call that nation My People which was not My People, and I will call her beloved who was not beloved.
28182	45	9	26	 And in the place where it was said to them, `No people of Mine are you,' there shall they be called sons of the  everliving God.">
28183	45	9	27	 And Isaiah cries aloud concerning Israel, <"Though the number of the sons of Israel be like the sands of the sea, only a remnant of them shall be saved;
28184	45	9	28	 for the Lord will  hold a reckoning upon the earth, making it efficacious and brief.">
28185	45	9	29	 Even as Isaiah  says in an earlier place, <"Were it not that the Lord, the God of  Hosts, had left us some few descendants, we should have become like Sodom, and have come to resemble Gomorrah.">
28186	45	9	30	 To what conclusion does this bring us? Why, that the  Gentiles, who were not in  pursuit of righteousness, have overtaken it--a righteousness, however, which arises from faith;
28187	45	9	31	 while  the descendants of Israel, who were in pursuit of a Law that could give righteousness, have not arrived at one.
28188	45	9	32	 And why? Because they were pursuing a righteousness which should arise not from faith, but from  what they regarded as merit. They stuck their foot against the stone which lay in their way;
28189	45	9	33	 in agreement with the statement of Scripture, <"See, I am placing on Mount Zion a stone for people to stumble at, and a rock for them to trip over, and yet he whose faith rests upon it shall never have reason to feel ashamed.">
28190	45	10	1	 Brethren, the  longing of my heart, and my prayer to God, on behalf of my countrymen is for their salvation.
28191	45	10	2	 For I bear witness that they possess an enthusiasm for God, but it is an unenlightened enthusiasm.
28192	45	10	3	 Ignorant of the righteousness which God provides and  building their hopes upon a  righteousness of their own, they have refused submission to God's righteousness.
28193	45	10	4	 For as a means of righteousness Christ is the  termination of Law to every believer.
28194	45	10	5	 Moses  says that he whose actions conform to the righteousness required by the Law shall live by that righteousness.
28195	45	10	6	 But the righteousness which is based on faith speaks in a different tone. "Say not in your heart," it declares, "`Who shall ascend to Heaven?'" --that is, to bring Christ down;
28196	45	10	7	 "nor `Who shall go down into the  abyss?'" --that is, to bring Christ  up again from the grave.
28197	45	10	8	 But what does it say? "The Message is close to you, in your mouth and in your heart;" that is, the Message which we are publishing about the faith--
28198	45	10	9	 that if with your mouth you confess Jesus as Lord and in your heart believe that God brought Him back to life, you shall be saved.
28199	45	10	10	 For with the heart men believe and obtain righteousness, and with the mouth they make confession and obtain salvation.
28200	45	10	11	 The Scripture says, <"No one who believes in Him shall have reason to feel ashamed.">
28201	45	10	12	 Jew and Gentile are on precisely the same footing; for the same Lord is Lord over all,  and is infinitely kind to all who call upon Him for deliverance.
28202	45	10	13	 For <"every one, without exception, who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.">
28203	45	10	14	 But how are they to call on One in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in One whose voice they have never heard? And how are they to hear without a preacher?
28204	45	10	15	 And how are men to preach unless they have been sent to do so? As it is written, <"How beautiful are the feet of those who bring glad tidings of good!">
28205	45	10	16	 But, some will say, they have not all hearkened to the Good News. No, for Isaiah asks, <"Lord, who has believed the Message they have heard from us?">
28206	45	10	17	 And this proves that faith comes from a Message heard, and that the Message comes through its having been spoken by Christ.
28207	45	10	18	 But, I ask, have they not heard? Yes, indeed: <"To the whole world  the preachers' voices have sounded forth, and their words to the remotest parts of the earth.">
28208	45	10	19	 But again, did Israel fail to  understand? Listen to Moses first. He says, <"I will fire you with jealousy against a nation which is no nation, and with fury against a nation devoid of understanding.">
28209	45	10	20	 And Isaiah, with strange boldness, exclaims, <"I have been found by those who were not looking for Me, I have revealed Myself to those who were not inquiring of Me.">
28210	45	10	21	 While as to Israel he says, <"All day long I have stretched out My  arms to a self-willed and fault-finding people.">
28211	45	11	1	 I ask then, Has God cast off His People? No, indeed. Why, I myself am an Israelite, of the posterity of Abraham and of the tribe of Benjamin.
28212	45	11	2	 God has not cast off His People whom He knew beforehand. Or are you ignorant of what Scripture says in speaking of Elijah--how he pleaded with God against Israel, saying,
28213	45	11	3	 <"Lord, they have put Thy Prophets to death, and have  overthrown Thy altars; and, now that I alone remain, they are thirsting for my blood"?>
28214	45	11	4	 But what did God say to him in reply? <"I have reserved for Myself 7,000 men who have never bent the knee to Baal.">
28215	45	11	5	 In the same way also at the present time there has come to be a remnant whom God in His grace has selected.
28216	45	11	6	 But if it is in His grace that He has selected them, then His choice is no longer determined by human actions. Otherwise grace would be grace no longer.
28217	45	11	7	 How then does the matter stand? It stands thus. That which Israel are in earnest pursuit of, they have not obtained; but God's chosen servants have obtained it, and the rest have become hardened.
28218	45	11	8	 And so Scripture says, <"God has given them a spirit of drowsiness--eyes to see nothing with and ears to hear nothing with--even until now.">
28219	45	11	9	 And David says, <"Let their very food become a snare and a trap to them, a stumbling-block and a retribution.
28220	45	11	10	 Let darkness come over their eyes that they may be unable to see, and make Thou their backs continually to stoop.">
28221	45	11	11	 I ask, however, "Have they stumbled so as to be finally ruined?" No, indeed; but by their lapse salvation has come to the Gentiles in order to arouse the jealousy of the descendants of Israel;
28222	45	11	12	 and if their lapse is the  enriching of the world, and their overthrow the  enriching of the Gentiles, will not still greater good follow their restoration?
28223	45	11	13	 But to you Gentiles I say that,  since I am an Apostle specially sent to the Gentiles, I take pride in my ministry,
28224	45	11	14	 trying whether I can succeed in rousing my own countrymen to jealousy and thus save some of them.
28225	45	11	15	 For if their having been cast aside has carried with it the reconciliation of the world, what will their being accepted again be but Life out of death?
28226	45	11	16	 Now if the firstfruits of the dough are holy, so also is the whole mass; and if the root of a tree is holy, so also are the branches.
28227	45	11	17	 And if some of the branches have been pruned away, and you, although you were but a wild olive, have been grafted in among them and have become a sharer with others in the  rich sap of the root of the olive tree,
28228	45	11	18	 beware of glorying over the natural branches. Or if you are so glorying, do not forget that it is not you who uphold the root: the root upholds you.
28229	45	11	19	 "Branches have been lopped off," you will say, "for the sake of my being grafted in."
28230	45	11	20	 This is true; yet it was their unbelief that cut them off, and you only stand through your faith.
28231	45	11	21	 Do not be puffed up with pride. Tremble rather--for if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will He spare you.
28232	45	11	22	 Notice therefore God's kindness and God's severity. On those who have fallen His severity has descended, but upon you His kindness has come, provided that you do not cease to respond to that kindness. Otherwise you will be cut off also.
28233	45	11	23	 Moreover, if they turn from their unbelief, they too will be grafted in. For God is powerful enough to graft them in again;
28234	45	11	24	  and if you were cut from that which by nature is a wild olive and contrary to nature were grafted into the good olive tree, how much more certainly will these natural branches be grafted on their own olive tree?
28235	45	11	25	 For there is a truth, brethren, not revealed hitherto, of which I do not wish to leave you in ignorance, for fear you should attribute superior wisdom to yourselves--the truth, I mean, that partial blindness has fallen upon Israel until the great mass of the  Gentiles have come in;
28236	45	11	26	 and so all Israel will be saved. As is declared in Scripture, <"From Mount Zion  a Deliverer will come: He will remove  all ungodliness from  Jacob;
28237	45	11	27	 and this shall be My Covenant with them; when I have taken away their sins.">
28238	45	11	28	 In relation to the Good News, the Jews are God's enemies for your sakes; but in relation to God's choice they are dearly loved for the sake of their forefathers.
28239	45	11	29	 For God does not repent of His free gifts nor of His call;
28240	45	11	30	  but just as you were formerly disobedient to Him, but now have received mercy at a time when they are disobedient,
28241	45	11	31	 so now they also have been disobedient at a time when you are receiving mercy; so that to them too there  may now be mercy.
28242	45	11	32	 For God has locked up all in the prison of unbelief, that upon all alike He may have mercy.
28243	45	11	33	 Oh, how inexhaustible are God's resources and God's wisdom and God's knowledge! How impossible it is to search into His decrees or trace His footsteps!
28244	45	11	34	 <"Who has ever known the mind of the Lord, or shared His counsels?"
28245	45	11	35	 "Who has first given God anything, so as to receive payment in return?">
28246	45	11	36	 For the universe owes its origin to Him, was created by Him, and has its aim and purpose in Him. To Him be the glory throughout the Ages! Amen.
28247	45	12	1	 I plead with you therefore, brethren, by the  compassionsof God, to present  all your faculties to Him as a living and holy sacrifice acceptable to Him. This with you will be an act of reasonable worship.
28248	45	12	2	 And do not follow the customs of the present age, but be transformed by the entire renewal of your minds, so that you may  learn by experience what God's will is--that will which is good and beautiful and perfect.
28249	45	12	3	 For through the  authority graciously given to me I warn every individual among you  not to value himself unduly, but to cultivate sobriety of judgement in accordance with the amount of faith which God has allotted to each one.
28250	45	12	4	 For just as there are in the one human body many parts, and these parts have not all the same function;
28251	45	12	5	 so collectively we form one body in Christ, while individually we are linked to one another as its members.
28252	45	12	6	 But since we have special gifts which differ in accordance with the diversified  work graciously entrusted to us, if it is prophecy, let the prophet speak  in exact proportion to his faith;
28253	45	12	7	 if it is the gift of  administration, let the administrator exercise a sound judgement in his duties.
28254	45	12	8	 The teacher must do the same in his teaching; and he who exhorts others, in his exhortation. He who gives should be liberal; he who is in authority should be energetic and alert; and he who succours the afflicted should do it cheerfully.
28255	45	12	9	 Let your love be perfectly sincere. Regard with horror what is evil; cling to what is right.
28256	45	12	10	 As for brotherly love, be affectionate to one another; in matters of worldly honour, yield to one another.
28257	45	12	11	 Do not be indolent when zeal is required. Be thoroughly warm-hearted,  the Lord's own servants,
28258	45	12	12	 full of joyful hope, patient under persecution, earnest and persistent in prayer.
28259	45	12	13	 Relieve the necessities of God's people; always practise hospitality.
28260	45	12	14	 Invoke blessings on your persecutors--blessings, not curses.
28261	45	12	15	 Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep.
28262	45	12	16	 Have full sympathy with one another. Do not give your mind to high things, but  let humble ways content you. <Do not be wise in your own conceits.>
28263	45	12	17	 Pay back to no man evil for evil. <Take thought for what is right and seemly in every one's esteem.>
28264	45	12	18	 If you can, so far as it depends on you, live at peace with all the world.
28265	45	12	19	 Do not be revengeful, my dear friends, but give way before  anger; for it is written, <"`Revenge belongs to Me: I will pay back,'> says the Lord."
28266	45	12	20	 On the contrary, therefore, <if your enemy is hungry, give him food; if he is thirsty, quench his thirst. For by doing this you will be  heaping burning coals upon his head.>
28267	45	12	21	 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome the evil with goodness.
28268	45	13	1	 Let every individual be obedient to those who rule over him; for no one is a ruler except by God's permission, and our present rulers have had their rank and power assigned to them by Him.
28269	45	13	2	 Therefore the man who rebels against his ruler is resisting God's will; and those who thus resist will bring punishment upon themselves.
28270	45	13	3	 For judges and magistrates  are to be feared not by right-doers but by wrong-doers. You desire--do you not? --to have no reason to fear your ruler. Well, do the thing that is right, and then he will commend you.
28271	45	13	4	 For he is God's servant for your benefit. But if you do what is wrong, be afraid. He does not wear the sword to no purpose: he is God's servant--an administrator to inflict  punishment upon evil-doers.
28272	45	13	5	 We must obey therefore, not only in order to escape punishment, but also for conscience' sake.
28273	45	13	6	 Why, this is really the reason you pay  taxes; for  tax-gatherers are  ministers of God, devoting their energies to this very work.
28274	45	13	7	 Pay  promptly to all men what is due to them: taxes to those to whom taxes are due, toll to those to whom toll is due, respect to those to whom respect is due, honour to those to whom honour is due.
28275	45	13	8	 Owe nothing to any one except  mutual love; for he who loves his fellow man has satisfied the demands of Law.
28276	45	13	9	 For the precepts, <"Thou shalt not commit adultery," "Thou shalt do no murder," "Thou shalt not steal," "Thou shalt not covet,"> and all other precepts, are summed up in this one command, <"Thou shalt love thy fellow man as much as thou lovest thyself.">
28277	45	13	10	 Love avoids doing any wrong to one's fellow man, and is therefore complete obedience to Law.
28278	45	13	11	 Carry out these injunctions because you know the critical period at which we are living, and that it is now high time,  to rouse yourselves from sleep; for salvation is now nearer to us than when we  first became believers.
28279	45	13	12	 The night is far advanced, and day is about to dawn. We must therefore lay aside the deeds of darkness, and clothe ourselves with the armour of Light.
28280	45	13	13	 Living as we do in broad daylight, let us conduct ourselves becomingly, not indulging in revelry and drunkenness, nor in lust and debauchery, nor in quarrelling and  jealousy.
28281	45	13	14	 On the contrary, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for gratifying your earthly cravings.
28282	45	14	1	 I now pass to another subject. Receive as a friend a man whose faith is weak, but not for the purpose of deciding  mere matters of opinion.
28283	45	14	2	 One man's faith allows him to eat anything, while a man of weaker faith eats nothing but vegetables.
28284	45	14	3	 Let not him who eats certain food look down upon him who abstains from it, nor him who abstains from it find fault with him who eats it; for God has received both of them.
28285	45	14	4	 Who are you that you should find fault with the servant of another?  Whether he stands or falls is a matter which concerns his own master. But stand he will; for the Master can give him power to stand.
28286	45	14	5	 One man esteems one day more highly than another; another esteems all days alike. Let every one be thoroughly convinced in his own mind.
28287	45	14	6	 He who regards the day as sacred, so regards it for the Master's sake; and he who eats certain food eats it for the Master's sake, for he gives thanks to God; and he who refrains from eating it refrains for the Master's sake, and he also gives thanks to God.
28288	45	14	7	 For not one of us lives to himself, and not one dies to himself.
28289	45	14	8	 If we live, we live to the Lord: if we die, we die to the Lord. So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.
28290	45	14	9	 For this was the purpose of Christ's dying and coming to life--namely that He might be Lord both of the dead and the living.
28291	45	14	10	 But you, why do you find fault with your brother? Or you, why do you look down upon your brother? We shall all stand before God to be judged;
28292	45	14	11	 for it is written, <"`As I live,'> says the Lord, <`to Me every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall make confession to God.'">
28293	45	14	12	 So we see that every one of us will give account of himself to God.
28294	45	14	13	 Therefore let us no longer judge one another; but, instead of that, you should come to this judgement--that we must not put a stumbling-block in our brother's path, nor anything to trip him up.
28295	45	14	14	 As one who lives in union with the Lord Jesus, I know and am certain that in its own nature  no food is `impure'; but if people regard any food as impure, to them it is.
28296	45	14	15	 If your brother is pained by the food you are eating, your conduct is no longer controlled by love.  Take care lest, by the food you eat, you lead to ruin a man for whom Christ died.
28297	45	14	16	 Therefore do not let  the boon which is yours  in common  be exposed to reproach.
28298	45	14	17	 For the Kingdom of God does not consist of eating and drinking, but of right conduct, peace and joy, through the Holy Spirit;
28299	45	14	18	 and whoever in this way devotedly serves Christ, God takes pleasure in him, and men  highly commend him.
28300	45	14	19	 Therefore let us aim at whatever makes for peace and mutual upbuilding of character.
28301	45	14	20	 Do not for food's sake be throwing down God's work.  All food is pure; but a man is in the wrong if his food is a snare  to others.
28302	45	14	21	 The right course is to forego eating meat or drinking wine or doing anything that tends to your brother's  fall.
28303	45	14	22	 As for you and your faith, keep your faith to yourself in the presence of God. The man is to be congratulated who does not pronounce judgement on himself in what his actions sanction.
28304	45	14	23	 But he who has misgivings and yet eats meat is condemned already, because his conduct is not based on faith; for all conduct not based on faith is sinful.
28305	45	15	1	 As for us who are strong, our duty is to bear with the weaknesses of those who are not strong, and not seek our own pleasure.
28306	45	15	2	 Let each of us endeavour to please his fellow Christian, aiming at a blessing calculated to build him up.
28307	45	15	3	 For even the Christ did not seek His own pleasure. His principle was, <"The reproaches which they  addressed to Thee have fallen on me.">
28308	45	15	4	 For all that was written of old has been written for our instruction, so that we may always have hope through the power of endurance and the  encouragement which the Scriptures afford.
28309	45	15	5	 And may God,  the giver of power of endurance and of that encouragement, grant you to be in full sympathy with one another in accordance with the example of Christ Jesus,
28310	45	15	6	 so that with oneness both of heart and voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
28311	45	15	7	 Habitually therefore give one another a friendly reception, just as Christ also has received you, and thus promote the glory of God.
28312	45	15	8	  My meaning is that Christ has become  a servant to the people of Israel in vindication of God's truthfulness--  in showing how sure are the promises made to our forefathers--
28313	45	15	9	 and that the Gentiles also have glorified God in acknowledgment of His mercy. So it is written, <"For this reason I will praise Thee among the Gentiles, and sing psalms in honour of Thy name.">
28314	45	15	10	 And again the Psalmist says, <"Be glad, ye Gentiles, in company with His People.">
28315	45	15	11	 And again, <"Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles, and let all the people extol Him.">
28316	45	15	12	 And again Isaiah says, <"There shall be the Root of Jesse and One who rises up to rule the Gentiles. On Him shall the Gentiles build their hopes.">
28317	45	15	13	 May God, the giver of hope, fill you with  continual joy and peace  because you trust in Him--so that you may have abundant hope through the power of the Holy Spirit.
28318	45	15	14	 But as to you, brethren, I am convinced--  yes, I Paul am convinced--that, even apart from my teaching, you are already full of goodness of heart, and enriched with complete Christian knowledge, and are also competent to instruct one another.
28319	45	15	15	 But I write to you the more boldly--partly as reminding you of what you already know--because of the  authority graciously entrusted to me by God,
28320	45	15	16	 that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus among the Gentiles, doing priestly duties in connexion with God's Good News so that the sacrifice--namely the Gentiles--may be acceptable to Him, being (as it is) an offering which the Holy Spirit has made holy.
28321	45	15	17	 I can therefore glory in Christ Jesus concerning the work for God in which I am engaged.
28322	45	15	18	 For I will not presume to mention any of the results that Christ has brought about by other agency than mine in securing the obedience of the Gentiles by word or deed,
28323	45	15	19	 with power manifested in signs and marvels, and through the power of the Holy Spirit.  But--to speak simply of my own labours--beginning in Jerusalem and the outlying districts, I  have proclaimed without reserve, even as far as Illyricum, the Good News of the Christ;
28324	45	15	20	 making it my ambition, however, not to tell the Good News where Christ's name was already known, for fear I should be building on another man's foundation.
28325	45	15	21	 But, as Scripture says, <"Those shall see, to whom no report about Him has hitherto come, and those who until now have not heard shall understand.">
28326	45	15	22	 And it is really  this which has again and again prevented my coming to you.
28327	45	15	23	 But now, as there is no more unoccupied ground in this part of the world, and I have for years past been eager to pay you a visit,
28328	45	15	24	 I hope, as soon as ever I extend my travels into Spain, to see you on my way and be helped forward by you on my journey, when I have first enjoyed being with you for a time.
28329	45	15	25	 But at present I am going to Jerusalem to serve God's people,
28330	45	15	26	 for Macedonia and Greece have kindly contributed a certain sum in relief of the poor among God's people, in Jerusalem.
28331	45	15	27	 Yes, they have kindly done this, and, in fact, it was a debt they owed them. For seeing that the Gentiles have been admitted in to partnership with the Jews in their spiritual blessings, they in turn are under an obligation to render sacred service to the Jews in temporal things.
28332	45	15	28	 So after  discharging this duty, and making sure that these kind gifts reach  those for whom they are intended, I shall start for Spain, passing through Rome on my way there;
28333	45	15	29	 and I know that when I come to you it will be with a vast amount of blessing from Christ.
28334	45	15	30	  But I entreat you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love which His Spirit inspires, to help me by wrestling in prayer to God on my behalf,
28335	45	15	31	 asking that I may escape unhurt from those in Judaea who are disobedient, and that the service which I am going to Jerusalem to render may be well received by the Church there,
28336	45	15	32	 in order that if God be willing I may come to you with a glad heart, and may enjoy a time of rest with you.
28337	45	15	33	 May God, who gives peace be with you all! Amen.
28338	45	16	1	 Herewith I introduce our sister Phoebe to you,  who is a  servant of the Church at Cenchreae,
28339	45	16	2	 that you may receive her as a fellow Christian in a manner worthy of God's people, and may assist her in any matter in which she may need help. For she has indeed been a kind friend to many, including myself.
28340	45	16	3	 Greetings to Prisca and Aquila my fellow labourers in the work of Christ Jesus--
28341	45	16	4	 friends who have endangered their own lives for mine. I am grateful to them, and not I alone, but all the Gentile Churches also.
28342	45	16	5	 Greetings, too, to  the Church that meets at their house. Greetings to my dear Epaenetus, who was the earliest convert to Christ in the province of Asia;
28343	45	16	6	 to Mary who has laboured strenuously among you;
28344	45	16	7	 and to Andronicus and  Junia, my  countrymen, who once shared my imprisonment. They  are of note among the Apostles, and  are Christians of longer standing than myself.
28345	45	16	8	 Greetings to Ampliatus, dear to me in the Lord;
28346	45	16	9	 to Urban, our fellow labourer in Christ, and to my dear Stachys.
28347	45	16	10	 Greetings to Apella, that veteran believer; and to the members of the household of Aristobulus.
28348	45	16	11	 Greetings to my countryman, Herodion; and to the believing members of the household of Narcissus.
28349	45	16	12	 Greetings to those Christian workers, Tryphaena and Tryphosa; also to dear Persis, who has laboured strenuously in the Lord's work.
28350	45	16	13	 Greetings to Rufus, who is one of the Lord's chosen people; and to his mother, who has also been a mother to me.
28351	45	16	14	 Greetings to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and to the brethren associated with them;
28352	45	16	15	 to Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister and Olympas, and to all God's people associated with them.
28353	45	16	16	 Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the Churches of Christ send greetings to you.
28354	45	16	17	 But I beseech you, brethren, to keep a watch on those who are causing the divisions among you, and are leading others into sin, in defiance of the instruction which you have received; and  habitually to shun them.
28355	45	16	18	 For men of that stamp are not bondservants of Christ our Lord, but are slaves to their own appetites; and by their plausible words and their flattery they utterly deceive the minds of the simple.
28356	45	16	19	 Your  fidelity to the truth is everywhere known. I rejoice over you, therefore, but I wish you to be wise as to what is good, and simple-minded as to what is evil.
28357	45	16	20	 And  before long, God  the giver of peace will crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus  Christ be with you!
28358	45	16	21	 Timothy, my fellow worker, sends you greetings, and so do my countrymen Lucius, Jason and Sosipater.
28359	45	16	22	 I, Tertius, who write this letter, send you Christian greetings.
28360	45	16	23	 Gaius, my host, who is also the host  of the whole Church, greets you. So do Erastus, the treasurer of the city, and Quartus our brother.
28361	45	16	24	  []
28362	45	16	25	  To Him who has it in His power to make you strong, as declared in the Good News which I am spreading, and the proclamation concerning Jesus Christ, in harmony with the unveiling of the Truth which in the periods of past Ages remained unuttered,
28363	45	16	26	 but has now been brought fully to light, and by the command of the God of the Ages has been made known by the writings of the Prophets among all the Gentiles to win them to  obedience to the faith--
28364	45	16	27	 to God, the only wise, through Jesus Christ,  even to Him be the glory through all the Ages! Amen.
28365	46	1	1	 Paul, called to be an Apostle of  Christ Jesus through the will of God--and our brother Sosthenes:
28366	46	1	2	 To the Church of God in Corinth, men and women  consecrated in Christ Jesus, called  to be  saints, with all in every place who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ--  their Lord as well as ours.
28367	46	1	3	 May grace and peace be granted to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
28368	46	1	4	 I thank my God continually on your behalf for the grace of God bestowed on you  in Christ Jesus--
28369	46	1	5	 that you have been  so richly blessed in Him, with readiness of speech and fulness of knowledge.
28370	46	1	6	 Thus my testimony as to the Christ has been confirmed in your experience,
28371	46	1	7	 so that there is no gift of God in which you  consciously come short while patiently waiting for the reappearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
28372	46	1	8	 who will also keep you stedfast to the very End, so that you will be free from reproach on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
28373	46	1	9	 God is ever true to His promises, and it was by Him that you were, one and all, called  into fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ, our Lord.
28374	46	1	10	 Now I entreat you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to  cultivate a spirit of harmony--all of you--and that there be no divisions among you, but rather a perfect union through your having one mind and one judgement.
28375	46	1	11	 For I have been distinctly informed, my brethren, about you by Chloe's people, that there are dissensions among you.
28376	46	1	12	 What I mean is that each of you is a partisan. One man says "I belong to Paul;" another "I belong to Apollos;" a third "I belong to  Peter;" a fourth "I belong to Christ."
28377	46	1	13	 Is the Christ  in fragments? Is it Paul who was crucified on your behalf? Or were you baptized  to be Paul's adherents?
28378	46	1	14	 I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius--
28379	46	1	15	 for fear people should say that you were baptized  to be my adherents.
28380	46	1	16	 I did, however, baptize Stephanas' household also: but I do not think that I baptized any one else.
28381	46	1	17	 Christ did not send me to baptize, but to proclaim the Good News; and not in merely wise words--lest the Cross of Christ should be deprived of its power.
28382	46	1	18	 For  the Message of the Cross is  foolishness to those who are on the way to perdition, but it is the power of God to those whom He is saving.
28383	46	1	19	 For so it stands written, <"I will exhibit the nothingness of the wisdom of  the wise, and the intelligence of the intelligent I will bring to nought.">
28384	46	1	20	 Where is your wise man? Where your expounder of the Law? Where your investigator of the questions of this present age? Has not God shown the world's wisdom to be utter foolishness?
28385	46	1	21	 For after the world by its wisdom--as God in His wisdom had ordained--had failed to gain the knowledge of God, God was pleased, by the apparent foolishness of the Message which we preach, to save those who accepted it.
28386	46	1	22	 Seeing that Jews demand  miracles, and Greeks go in search of wisdom,
28387	46	1	23	 while we proclaim a Christ who has been crucified--to the Jews a stumbling-block, to Gentiles foolishness,
28388	46	1	24	 but to those who have received the Call, whether Jews or Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
28389	46	1	25	 Because that which the world deems foolish in God is wiser than men's wisdom, and that which it deems feeble in God is mightier than men's might.
28390	46	1	26	 For consider, brethren, God's call to you.  Not many who are wise with merely human wisdom, not many of position and influence, not many of noble birth have been called.
28391	46	1	27	 But God has chosen the things which the world regards as foolish, in order to put its wise men to shame; and God has chosen the things which the world regards as destitute of influence, in order to put its powerful things to shame;
28392	46	1	28	 and the things which the world regards as base, and those which it sets utterly at nought--things  that have no existence--God has chosen in order to reduce to nothing things that do exist;
28393	46	1	29	 to prevent any mortal man from boasting in the presence of God.
28394	46	1	30	 But you--and it is all God's doing--are in Christ Jesus: He has become for us a wisdom which is from God, consisting of righteousness and sanctification and  deliverance;
28395	46	1	31	 in order that it may be as Scripture says, <"He who boasts--let his boast be in the Lord.">
28396	46	2	1	 And as for myself, brethren, when I came to you, it was not with surpassing power of eloquence or earthly wisdom that I came, announcing to you  that which God had commanded me to bear witness to.
28397	46	2	2	  For I determined to be utterly ignorant, when among you, of everything except of Jesus Christ, and of Him as having been crucified.
28398	46	2	3	 And so far as I myself was concerned, I came to you  in conscious feebleness and in fear and in deep anxiety.
28399	46	2	4	 And my language and the Message that I proclaimed were not adorned with persuasive words of earthly wisdom, but depended upon truths which the Spirit taught and mightily carried home;
28400	46	2	5	 so that your trust might rest not on the wisdom of man but on the power of God.
28401	46	2	6	 Yet when we are among mature believers we do speak words of wisdom; a wisdom not belonging, however, to the present age nor to the leaders of the present age who are soon to pass away.
28402	46	2	7	 But in dealing with truths hitherto kept secret we speak of God's wisdom--that hidden wisdom which, before the world began, God pre-destined, so that it should result in glory to us;
28403	46	2	8	 a wisdom which not one of the leaders of the present age  possesses, for if they had  possessed it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.
28404	46	2	9	 But--to use the words of Scripture--we speak of <things which eye has not seen nor ear heard,> and which have never entered the heart of man: <all that God has in readiness for them that love Him.>
28405	46	2	10	 For us, however, God has drawn aside the veil through the teaching of the Spirit; for the Spirit searches everything, including the depths of the divine nature.
28406	46	2	11	 For, among human beings, who knows a man's inner thoughts except the man's own spirit within him? In the same way, also, only God's Spirit is acquainted with God's inner thoughts.
28407	46	2	12	 But we have not received  the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which comes forth from God, that we may know the blessings that have been so freely given to us by God.
28408	46	2	13	 Of these we speak--not in language which man's wisdom teaches us, but in that which the Spirit teaches--adapting, as we do, spiritual words to spiritual  truths.
28409	46	2	14	 The  unspiritual man rejects the  things of the Spirit of God, and cannot attain to the knowledge of them, because they are spiritually judged.
28410	46	2	15	 But the spiritual man judges of everything, although he is himself judged by no one.
28411	46	2	16	 For <who has penetrated the mind of the Lord, and will instruct Him?> But *we* have the mind of Christ.
28412	46	3	1	 And as for myself, brethren, I found it impossible to speak to you as spiritual men. It had to be as to worldlings--mere babes in Christ.
28413	46	3	2	  I fed you with milk and not with solid food, since for this you were not yet strong enough. And even now you are not strong enough:
28414	46	3	3	 you are still unspiritual. For  so long as jealousy and strife continue among you, can it be denied that you are unspiritual and are living and acting like mere men of the world?
28415	46	3	4	 For when some one says, "I belong to Paul," and another says, "I belong to Apollos," is not this the way men of the world speak?
28416	46	3	5	 What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? They are just God's servants, through whose efforts, and as the Lord granted power to each, you accepted the faith.
28417	46	3	6	 I planted and Apollos watered; but it was God who was, all the time, giving the increase.
28418	46	3	7	 So that neither the planter nor the waterer is of any importance. God who gives the increase is all in all.
28419	46	3	8	 Now in aim and purpose the planter and the waterer are one; and yet each will receive his own special reward, answering to his own special work.
28420	46	3	9	  Apollos and I are simply fellow workers  for and with God, and you are *God's* field-- *God's* building.
28421	46	3	10	  In discharge of the task which God graciously entrusted to me, I--like a competent master-builder--have laid a foundation, and others are building upon it. But let every one be careful how and what he builds.
28422	46	3	11	 For no one can lay any other foundation in addition to that which is already laid, namely Jesus Christ.
28423	46	3	12	 And whether the building which any one  is erecting on that foundation be of gold or silver or costly stones, of timber or hay or straw--
28424	46	3	13	 the true character of each individual's work will become manifest. For  the day of Christ will disclose it, because that day  is soon to come upon us clothed in fire, and as for the quality of every one's work-- the fire is the thing which will test it.
28425	46	3	14	 If any one's work--the building which he has erected--stands the test, he will be rewarded.
28426	46	3	15	  If any one's work is burnt up, he will suffer the loss of it; yet he will himself be rescued, but only, as it were, by passing through the fire.
28427	46	3	16	 Do you not know that you are God's Sanctuary, and that the Spirit of God has His home within you?
28428	46	3	17	 If any one is marring the Sanctuary of God, him will God mar; for the Sanctuary of God is holy, which you all are.
28429	46	3	18	 Let no one deceive himself. If any man imagines that he is wise,  compared with the rest of you, with the wisdom of the present age, let him become "foolish" so that he may be wise.
28430	46	3	19	 This world's wisdom is "foolishness" in God's sight; for it is written, <"He snares the wise with their own cunning.">
28431	46	3	20	 And again, <"The Lord takes knowledge of the reasonings of the wise--how useless they are.">
28432	46	3	21	 Therefore let no one boast about  his human teachers.
28433	46	3	22	 For everything belongs to you--be it Paul or Apollos or  Peter, the world or life or death,  things present or future--everything belongs to you;
28434	46	3	23	 and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.
28435	46	4	1	 As for  us Apostles, let any one take this view of us--we are Christ's  officers, and stewards of God's secret truths.
28436	46	4	2	 This being so, it follows that fidelity is what is required in stewards.
28437	46	4	3	  I however am very little concerned at undergoing your scrutiny, or that of other men; in fact I do not even scrutinize myself.
28438	46	4	4	 Though I am not conscious of having been in any way unfaithful, yet I do not for that reason stand acquitted; but He whose scrutiny I must undergo is the Lord.
28439	46	4	5	 Therefore form no premature judgements, but wait until the Lord  returns. He will  both bring to light the secrets of darkness and will openly disclose the motives that have been in people's hearts; and then the praise which each man deserves will come to him from God.
28440	46	4	6	 In writing this much, brethren,  with special reference  to Apollos and myself, I have done so for your sakes, in order to teach you by our example what those words mean, which say, "Nothing beyond what is written!" --so that you may cease to take sides in boastful rivalry, for one teacher against another.
28441	46	4	7	  Why, who gives you your superiority, my brother? Or what have you that you did not receive? And if you really  did receive it, why boast as if this were not so?
28442	46	4	8	 Every one of you already  has all that heart can desire; already you  have grown rich; without waiting for us, you  have ascended your thrones! Yes indeed, would to God that you had ascended your thrones, that we also might reign with you!
28443	46	4	9	 God, it seems to me, has  exhibited us Apostles last of all, as men condemned to death; for we have come to be a spectacle to all creation--alike to angels and to men.
28444	46	4	10	 We, for Christ's sake, are labeled as "foolish";  you, as Christians, are men of shrewd intelligence. We are mere weaklings: you are strong. You are in high repute: we are outcasts.
28445	46	4	11	 To this very moment we endure both hunger and thirst, with scanty clothing and many a blow.
28446	46	4	12	 Homes we have none. Wearily we toil, working with our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we bear it patiently;
28447	46	4	13	 when slandered, we try to conciliate. We have  come to be regarded as the mere dirt and filth of the world--the refuse of the universe, even to this hour.
28448	46	4	14	 I am not writing all this to shame you, but I am offering you advice as my dearly-loved children.
28449	46	4	15	 For even if you were to have ten thousand  spiritual instructors--for all that you could not have several fathers. It is I who in Christ Jesus became your father through the Good News.
28450	46	4	16	 I entreat you therefore to become like me.
28451	46	4	17	 For this reason I  have sent Timothy to you.  Spiritually he is my dearly-loved and faithful child. He will remind you of my  habits as a Christian teacher--the manner in which I teach everywhere in every Church.
28452	46	4	18	 But some of you have been puffed up through getting the idea that I am not coming to  Corinth.
28453	46	4	19	 But, if the Lord is willing, I shall come to you without delay; and then I shall know not the fine speeches of these conceited people, but their power.
28454	46	4	20	 For  Apostolic authority is not a thing of words, but of power.
28455	46	4	21	 Which shall it be? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in a loving and tender spirit?
28456	46	5	1	 It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and of a kind unheard of even among the Gentiles--a man has his father's wife!
28457	46	5	2	 And you, instead of mourning and removing from among you the man who has done this deed of shame, are filled with self-complacency!
28458	46	5	3	 I for my part, present with you in spirit although absent in body, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has so acted.
28459	46	5	4	 In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are all assembled and my spirit is with you, together with the power of our Lord Jesus,
28460	46	5	5	 I have handed over such a man to Satan for the  destruction of his  body, that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord  Jesus.
28461	46	5	6	 It is no good thing--this which you make the ground of your boasting. Do you not know that a little  yeast  corrupts the whole of the dough?
28462	46	5	7	 Get rid of the old yeast so that you may be dough of a new kind; for in fact you *are*  free from corruption. For our Passover Lamb has already been offered in sacrifice--even Christ.
28463	46	5	8	 Therefore let us keep our festival not with old yeast nor with the yeast of what is evil and mischievous, but with bread free from yeast--the bread of  transparent sincerity and of truth.
28464	46	5	9	 I wrote to you  in that letter that you were not to associate with fornicators;
28465	46	5	10	  not that in this world you are to keep wholly aloof from such as they, any more than from people who are avaricious and greedy of gain, or from worshippers of idols. For that would mean that you would be compelled to go out of the world altogether.
28466	46	5	11	 But what I meant was that you were not to associate with any one bearing the name of "brother," if he was addicted to fornication or avarice or idol-worship or abusive language or hard-drinking or greed of gain. With such a man you ought not even to eat.
28467	46	5	12	 For what business of mine is it to judge outsiders? Is it not for you to judge those who are within the Church
28468	46	5	13	 while you leave to God's judgement those who are outside? Remove the wicked man from among you.
28469	46	6	1	 If one of you has a grievance against an opponent, does he dare to go to law before irreligious men and not before God's people?
28470	46	6	2	 Do you not know that God's people will sit in judgement upon the world? And if you are the court before which the world  is to be judged, are you unfit to deal with these petty matters?
28471	46	6	3	 Do you not know that we are to sit in judgement upon angels--to say nothing of things belonging to this life?
28472	46	6	4	 If therefore you have things belonging to this life which need to be decided, is it  men who are absolutely nothing in the Church--is it *they* whom you make your judges?
28473	46	6	5	 I say this to put you to shame. Has it come to this, that there does not exist among you a single wise man competent to decide between  a man and his brother,
28474	46	6	6	 but brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?
28475	46	6	7	  To say no more, then, it is altogether a defect in you that you have law-suits with one another. Why not rather endure injustice? Why not rather submit to being defrauded?
28476	46	6	8	 On the contrary you yourselves inflict injustice and fraud, and upon brethren too.
28477	46	6	9	 Do you not know that unrighteous men will not inherit God's Kingdom? Cherish no delusion here. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor any who are guilty of unnatural crime,
28478	46	6	10	 nor theives, nor avaricious people, nor any who are addicted to hard drinking, to abusive language or to greed of gain, will inherit God's Kingdom.
28479	46	6	11	 And all this describes what some of you were.  But now you have had every stain washed off: now you have been set apart as holy: now you have been pronounced free from guilt; in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and through the Spirit of our God.
28480	46	6	12	 Everything is allowable to me, but not everything is profitable. Everything is allowable to me, but  to nothing will I become a slave.
28481	46	6	13	 Food of all kinds is meant for the stomach, and the stomach is meant for food, and God will cause both of them to perish. Yet the body does not exist for the purpose of fornication, but for the Master's service, and the Master exists for the body;
28482	46	6	14	 and as God by His power raised the Master to life, so He will also raise us up.
28483	46	6	15	 Do you not know that your bodies are  members of Christ? Shall I then take away the members of Christ and make them the members of a prostitute? No, indeed.
28484	46	6	16	 Or do you not know that a man who has to do with a prostitute is one with her in body? For God says, <"The two shall become one.">
28485	46	6	17	 But he who is in union with the Master is one with Him in spirit.
28486	46	6	18	 Flee from fornication. Any other sin that a human being commits lies outside the body; but he who commits fornication sins against his own body.
28487	46	6	19	 Or do you not know that your bodies are a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit who is within you--the Spirit whom you have from God?
28488	46	6	20	 And you are not your own, for you have been  redeemed at infinite cost. Therefore glorify God in your bodies.
28489	46	7	1	 I now deal with the subjects mentioned in your letter. It is well for a man to abstain altogether from marriage.
28490	46	7	2	 But because there is so much fornication every man should have a wife of his own, and every woman should have a husband.
28491	46	7	3	 Let a man pay his wife her due, and let a woman also pay her husband his.
28492	46	7	4	 A married woman is not mistress of her own person: her husband has certain rights. In the same way a married man is not master of his own person: his wife has certain rights.
28493	46	7	5	  Do not refuse one another, unless perhaps it is just for a time and by mutual consent, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer and may then associate again; lest the Adversary begin to tempt you because of your deficiency in self-control.
28494	46	7	6	 Thus much in the way of concession, not of command.
28495	46	7	7	 Yet I would that everybody lived as I do; but each of us has his own special gift from God--one in one direction and one in another.
28496	46	7	8	 But I tell the unmarried, and women who are widows, that it is well for them to remain as I am.
28497	46	7	9	 If, however, they cannot maintain self-control, by all means let them marry; for marriage is better than the fever of passion.
28498	46	7	10	 But to those already married my instructions are--yet not mine, but the Lord's--that a wife is not to leave her husband;
28499	46	7	11	 or if she has already left him, let her either remain as she is or be reconciled to him; and that a husband is not to send away his wife.
28500	46	7	12	 To  the rest it is I who speak--not the Lord. If a brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, let him not send her away.
28501	46	7	13	 And a woman who has an unbelieving husband--if he consents to live with her, let her not separate from him.
28502	46	7	14	 For, in such cases, the unbelieving husband  has become--and is--holy through union with a Christian woman, and the unbelieving wife is holy through union with a Christian brother. Otherwise your children would be unholy, but in reality they have a place among God's people.
28503	46	7	15	 If, however, the unbeliever  is determined to leave, let him or her do so. Under such circumstances the Christian man or woman is no slave; God  has called us  to live lives of peace.
28504	46	7	16	 For what assurance have you, O woman, as to whether  you will save your husband? Or what assurance have you, O man, as to whether you will save your wife?
28505	46	7	17	  Only, whatever be  the condition in life which the Lord has assigned to each individual--and whatever the condition in which he was living when God called him--in that let him continue.
28506	46	7	18	 This is what I command in all the Churches. Was any one already circumcised when called? Let him not have recourse to the surgeons. Was any one uncircumcised when called? Let him remain uncircumcised.
28507	46	7	19	 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing: obedience to God's commandments is everything.
28508	46	7	20	 Whatever be the  condition in life in which a man was, when he was called, in that let him continue.
28509	46	7	21	 Were you a slave when God called you? Let not that weigh on your mind. And yet if you can get your freedom, take advantage of the opportunity.
28510	46	7	22	 For  a Christian, if he was a slave when called, is the Lord's freed man, and in the same way a free man, if called, becomes the slave of Christ.
28511	46	7	23	 You have all been  redeemed at infinite cost:  do not become slaves to men.
28512	46	7	24	 Where each one stood when he was called, there, brethren, let him still stand--close to God.
28513	46	7	25	 Concerning unmarried women I have no command to give you from the Lord; but I offer you my opinion, which is that of a man who, through the Lord's mercy, is deserving of your confidence.
28514	46	7	26	 I think then that, taking into consideration the distress which is now upon us, it is well for a man to remain as he is.
28515	46	7	27	 Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to get free. Are you free from the marriage bond? Do not seek for a wife.
28516	46	7	28	 Yet  if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a maiden marries, she has not sinned. Such people, however, will have  outward trouble. But I am for sparing you.
28517	46	7	29	 Yet of this I warn you, brethren:  the time has been  shortened--so that henceforth those who have wives should be as though they had none,
28518	46	7	30	 those who weep as though they did not weep, those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, those who buy as though they did not possess,
28519	46	7	31	 and those who use the world as not using it to the full. For the world as it now exists is passing away.
28520	46	7	32	 And I would have you free from worldly anxiety. An unmarried man concerns himself with the Lord's business--how he shall please the Lord;
28521	46	7	33	 but a married man concerns himself with the business of the world--how he shall please his wife.
28522	46	7	34	 There is a difference too between a married and an unmarried woman. She who is unmarried concerns herself with the Lord's business--that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but the married woman concerns herself with the business of the world--how she shall please her husband.
28523	46	7	35	 Thus much I say in your own interest; not to lay a trap for you, but to help towards what is becoming, and enable you to wait on the Lord without distraction.
28524	46	7	36	 If, however, a father thinks he is acting unbecomingly towards his still unmarried daughter if she be past the bloom of her youth, and so the matter is urgent, let him do what she desires; he commits no sin;  she and her suitor should be allowed to marry.
28525	46	7	37	 But if a father stands firm in his resolve, being free from all external constraint and having a legal right to act as he pleases, and in his own mind has come to the decision to keep his daughter unmarried, he will do well.
28526	46	7	38	 So that he who gives his daughter in marriage does well, and yet he who does not give her in marriage will do better.
28527	46	7	39	 A woman is bound to her husband during the whole period that he lives; but if her husband  dies, she is at liberty to marry whom she will, provided that he is a Christian.
28528	46	7	40	 But in my judgement, her state is a  more enviable one if she remains as she is; and I also think that I have the Spirit of God.
28529	46	8	1	 Now as to things which have been sacrificed to idols. This is a subject which we  already understand--because we all have knowledge of it. Knowledge, however, tends to make people conceited; it is love that builds us up.
28530	46	8	2	 If any one imagines that he already possesses any true knowledge, he has as yet attained to no knowledge of the kind to which he ought to have attained;
28531	46	8	3	 but if any one loves God, that man is known by God.
28532	46	8	4	 As to eating things which have been sacrificed to idols, we are fully aware  that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but One.
28533	46	8	5	 For if so-called gods do exist, either in Heaven or on earth--and in fact there are many such gods and many such lords--
28534	46	8	6	 yet *we* have but one God, the Father, who is the source of all things and for whose service we exist, and but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom we and all things exist.
28535	46	8	7	 But  all believers do not recognize these facts. Some,  from force of habit in relation to the idol, even now eat idol sacrifices as such, and their consciences, being but weak, are polluted.
28536	46	8	8	 It is true that a particular kind of food will not bring us into God's presence; we are neither inferior to others if we abstain from it, nor superior to them if we eat it.
28537	46	8	9	 But take care lest this liberty of yours should prove a hindrance to the progress of weak believers.
28538	46	8	10	 For if any one were to see you, who know the real truth of this matter, reclining  at table in an idol's temple, would not his conscience (supposing him to be a weak believer)  be emboldened to eat the food which has been sacrificed to the idol?
28539	46	8	11	 Why,  your knowledge becomes the ruin of the weak believer--your brother, for whom Christ died!
28540	46	8	12	 Moreover when you thus sin against the brethren and wound their weak consciences, you are, in reality, sinning against Christ.
28541	46	8	13	 Therefore if what I eat causes my brother to fall, never again to the end of my days will I touch any kind of animal food, for fear I should cause my brother to fall.
28542	46	9	1	 Am I not free? Am I not an Apostle? Can it be denied that I  have seen Jesus, our Lord? Are not you yourselves my work in the Lord?
28543	46	9	2	 If to other men I am not an Apostle, yet at any rate I am one to you; for your very existence as a Christian Church is the seal of my Apostleship.
28544	46	9	3	 That is how I vindicate myself to those who criticize me.
28545	46	9	4	 Have we not a right  to claim food and drink?
28546	46	9	5	 Have we not a right to take with us on our journeys a Christian sister as our wife, as the rest of the Apostles do--and the Lord's brothers and  Peter?
28547	46	9	6	 Or again, is it only  Barnabas and myself who are not at liberty to give up working with our hands?
28548	46	9	7	 What soldier ever serves at his own cost? Who plants a vineyard and yet does not eat any of the grapes? Or who tends a  herd of cattle and yet does not taste their milk?
28549	46	9	8	 Am I making use of merely worldly illustrations? Does not the Law speak in the same tone?
28550	46	9	9	 For in the Law of Moses it is written, <"Thou shalt not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.">
28551	46	9	10	 Is God simply thinking about the oxen? Or is it really in our interest that He speaks? Of course, it was written in our interest, because  it is His will that when a plough-man ploughs, and a thresher threshes, it should be in the hope of sharing that which comes as the result.
28552	46	9	11	 If it is we who sowed the spiritual grain in you, is it a great thing that we should reap a temporal harvest from you?
28553	46	9	12	 If other teachers  possess that right over you, do not we possess it much more? Yet we have not availed ourselves of the right, but we patiently endure all things rather than hinder in the least degree the progress of the Good News of the Christ.
28554	46	9	13	 Do you not know that those who perform the sacred rites have their food from  the sacred place, and that those who serve at the altar all alike share with the altar?
28555	46	9	14	 In the same way the Lord also  directed those who proclaim the Good News to maintain themselves by the Good News.
28556	46	9	15	 But I, for my part,  have not used, and do not use, my full rights in any of  these things. Nor do I now write with that object so far as I myself am concerned, for I would rather die than have anybody make this boast of mine an empty one.
28557	46	9	16	 If I go on preaching the Good News, that is nothing for me to boast of; for the necessity is imposed upon me; and alas for me, if I fail to preach it!
28558	46	9	17	 And if I preach willingly, I receive my wages; but if against my will, a stewardship has nevertheless been entrusted to me.
28559	46	9	18	 What are  my wages then? The very fact that the Good News which I preach will cost my hearers nothing,  so that I cannot be charged with  abuse of my privileges as a Christian preacher.
28560	46	9	19	 Though free from all human control, I  have made myself the slave of all in the hope of winning  as many converts as possible.
28561	46	9	20	 To the Jews I have become like a Jew in order to win Jews; to men under the Law as if I were under the Law--although I am not--in order to win those who are under the Law;
28562	46	9	21	 to men without Law as if I were without Law--although I am not without Law in relation to God but am abiding in Christ's Law--in order to win those who are without Law.
28563	46	9	22	 To the weak I have become weak, so as to gain the weak. To all men I have become all things, in the hope that in every one of these ways I may save some.
28564	46	9	23	 And I do everything for the sake of the Good News, that I may share with my hearers in its benefits.
28565	46	9	24	  Do you not know that in the foot-race the runners all run, but that only one gets the prize? You must run like him, in order to win with certainty.
28566	46	9	25	 But every competitor in an athletic contest practices abstemiousness in all directions. They indeed do this for the sake of securing a perishable wreath, but we for the sake of securing one that will not perish.
28567	46	9	26	 That is how I run, not being in any doubt as to my goal. I am a boxer who does not inflict blows on the air,
28568	46	9	27	 but I hit hard and straight at my own body and lead it off into slavery, lest possibly,  after I have been a herald to others, I should myself be  rejected.
28569	46	10	1	 For I would have you remember, brethren, how our forefathers were all of them  sheltered by the cloud, and all got safely through the  Red Sea.
28570	46	10	2	 All were baptized in the cloud and in the sea  to be followers of Moses.
28571	46	10	3	 All ate the same  spiritual food,
28572	46	10	4	 and all drank the same  spiritual drink; for they long drank the water that flowed from the spiritual rock that went with them--and that rock was the Christ.
28573	46	10	5	 But with most of them God was not well pleased; for they were laid low in the Desert.
28574	46	10	6	 And in this they became a warning to us, to teach us not to be eager, as they were eager, in pursuit of what is evil.
28575	46	10	7	 And you must not be worshippers of idols, as some of them were. For it is written, <"The People sat down to eat and drink, and stood up  to dance.">
28576	46	10	8	 Nor may we be fornicators, like some of them who committed fornication and on a single day  23,000 of them fell dead.
28577	46	10	9	 And do not let us  test the Lord too far, as some of them tested Him and were destroyed by the serpents.
28578	46	10	10	 And do not be discontented, as some of them were, and they were destroyed by the Destroyer.
28579	46	10	11	 All this kept happening to them with a figurative meaning; but it was put on record by way of admonition to us  upon whom the  ends of the Ages have come.
28580	46	10	12	 So then let him who thinks he is standing securely beware of falling.
28581	46	10	13	 No  temptation  has you in its power but such as is common to human nature; and God is faithful and will not allow you to be tempted beyond your strength. But, when the temptation comes, He will also provide the way of escape; so that you may be able to bear it.
28582	46	10	14	 Therefore, my dear friends, avoid all connection with the worship of idols.
28583	46	10	15	 I speak as to men of sense: judge for yourselves of what I say.
28584	46	10	16	 The cup of blessing, which we bless, does it not mean a joint-participation in the blood of Christ? The loaf of bread which we break, does it not mean a joint-participation in the body of Christ?
28585	46	10	17	  Since there is one loaf, we who are many are one body; we, all of us, share in that one loaf.
28586	46	10	18	 Look at the Israelites--the nation and their ritual. Are not those who eat the sacrifices joint-partakers in the altar?
28587	46	10	19	 Do I mean that a thing sacrificed to an idol is what it claims to be, or that an idol is a real thing?
28588	46	10	20	 No, but that which  the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, not to God; and I would not have you  have fellowship with one another through the demons.
28589	46	10	21	 You cannot drink the Lord's cup and the cup of demons: you cannot be joint-partakers both in the table of the Lord and in the table of demons.
28590	46	10	22	 Or are we actually arousing the Lord  to jealousy. Are we stronger than He is?
28591	46	10	23	 Everything is allowable, but not everything is profitable. Everything is allowable, but everything does not build others up.
28592	46	10	24	 Let no one be for ever seeking his own good, but let each seek that of his fellow man.
28593	46	10	25	 Anything that is for sale in the meat market, eat, and ask no questions  for conscience' sake;
28594	46	10	26	 for <the earth is the Lord's, and all that it contains.>
28595	46	10	27	 If an unbeliever gives you an invitation and you are disposed to accept it, eat whatever is put before you, and ask no questions for conscience' sake.
28596	46	10	28	 But  if any one tells you, "This food has been offered in sacrifice;" abstain from eating it--out of respect for him who warned you, and, as before, for conscience' sake.
28597	46	10	29	 But now I mean his conscience, not your own.  "Why, on what ground," you may object, "is the question of my liberty of action to be decided by a conscience not my own?
28598	46	10	30	 If, so far as I am concerned, I partake with a grateful heart, why am I to be found fault with in regard to a thing for which I give thanks?"
28599	46	10	31	 Whether, then, you are eating or drinking, or whatever you are doing, let everything be done to the glory of God.
28600	46	10	32	 Do not be causes of stumbling either to Jews or to Gentiles, nor to the Church of God.
28601	46	10	33	 That is the way that I also seek in everything the approval of all men, not aiming at my own profit, but at that of the many, in the hope that they may be saved.
28602	46	11	1	 Be imitators of me, in so far as I in turn am an imitator of Christ.
28603	46	11	2	 Now I commend you for remembering me in everything, and because you hold fast truths and practices precisely as I have taught them to you.
28604	46	11	3	 I would have you know, however, that of every man, Christ is the Head, that of a woman her husband is the Head, and that God is Christ's Head.
28605	46	11	4	 A man  who wears a veil when praying or  prophesying dishonors his Head;
28606	46	11	5	 but  a woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her Head, for  it is exactly the same as if she had her hair cut short.
28607	46	11	6	 If a woman will not wear a veil, let her also cut off her hair. But since it is a dishonor to a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, let her wear a veil.
28608	46	11	7	 For a man ought not to have a veil on his head, since he is the image and glory of God; while woman is the glory of man.
28609	46	11	8	 Man does not take his origin from woman, but woman takes hers from man.
28610	46	11	9	 For man was not created for woman's sake, but woman for man's.
28611	46	11	10	 That is why a woman ought to have on her head  a symbol of subjection,  because of the angels.
28612	46	11	11	 Yet,  in the Lord, woman is not independent of man nor man independent of woman.
28613	46	11	12	 For  just as woman originates from man, so also man comes into existence through woman, but everything springs originally from God.
28614	46	11	13	 Judge of this for your own selves: is it seemly for a woman to pray to God when she is unveiled?
28615	46	11	14	 Does not  Nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair it is a dishonor to him,
28616	46	11	15	 but that if a woman has long hair it is her glory, because her hair  was given her for a covering?
28617	46	11	16	 But if any one is inclined to be contentious on the point, we have no such custom, nor have the Churches of God.
28618	46	11	17	 But while giving you these instructions, there is one thing I cannot praise--your meeting together, with bad rather than good results.
28619	46	11	18	 for, in the first place, when you meet  as a Church, there are divisions among you. This is what I am told, and I believe that there is some truth in it.
28620	46	11	19	  For there must of necessity be differences of opinion among you, in order that it may be plainly seen who are the men of sterling worth among you.
28621	46	11	20	 When, however, you meet in one place, there is no eating the Supper of the Lord;
28622	46	11	21	 for it is his own supper of which each of you is in a hurry to partake, and  one eats like a hungry man, while another has already drunk to excess.
28623	46	11	22	 Why, have you no homes in which to eat and drink? Or do you wish to show your contempt for the Church of God and make those who have no homes feel ashamed? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this matter I certainly do not praise you.
28624	46	11	23	 For it was from the Lord that I received the facts which, in turn, I handed on to you;  how that the Lord Jesus, on the night He  was to be betrayed, took some bread,
28625	46	11	24	 and after giving thanks He broke it and said, "This is my body which is  about to be broken for you. Do this in memory of me."
28626	46	11	25	 In the same way, when the meal was over, He also took the cup. "This cup," He said, "is the new Covenant  of which my blood is the pledge. Do this, every time that you drink it, in memory of me."
28627	46	11	26	 For every time that you eat this bread and drink from the cup, you are proclaiming the Lord's death--until He  returns.
28628	46	11	27	 Whoever, therefore,  in an unworthy manner, eats the bread or drinks from the cup of the Lord  sins against the body and blood of the Lord.
28629	46	11	28	 But let a man examine himself, and, having done that, then let him eat the bread and drink from the cup.
28630	46	11	29	 For any one who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgement to himself, if he fails to  estimate the body aright.
28631	46	11	30	 That is why many among you are sickly and out of health, and why not a few  die.
28632	46	11	31	 If, however, we estimated ourselves aright, we should not be judged.
28633	46	11	32	 But when we are judged by the Lord, chastisement follows, to save us from being condemned along with the world.
28634	46	11	33	 Therefore, brethren, when you come together for this meal, wait for one another.
28635	46	11	34	 If any one is hungry, let him eat at home; so that your coming together may not lead to judgement.  The other matters I will deal with whenever I come.
28636	46	12	1	 It is important, brethren, that you should have clear knowledge on the subject of spiritual  gifts.
28637	46	12	2	 You know that when you were heathens you went astray after dumb idols, wherever you  happened to be led.
28638	46	12	3	 For this reason I would have you understand that no one speaking under the influence of The Spirit of God ever says, "Jesus is accursed," and that no one is able to say, "Jesus is Lord," except under the influence of the Holy Spirit.
28639	46	12	4	 Now there are various kinds of gifts, but there is one and the same Spirit;
28640	46	12	5	 various forms of official service, and yet one and the same Lord;
28641	46	12	6	 diversities in work, and yet one and the same God--He who in each person brings about the whole result.
28642	46	12	7	 But to each of us a manifestation of the Spirit has been granted for the common good.
28643	46	12	8	 To one the utterance of wisdom has been granted through the Spirit; to another the utterance of knowledge  in accordance with the will of the same Spirit;
28644	46	12	9	 to a third man, by means of the same Spirit, special faith; to another various gifts of healing, by means of the one Spirit;
28645	46	12	10	 to another the exercise of miraculous powers;  to another the gift of  prophecy; to another the power of discriminating between prophetic utterances; to another varieties of the gift of `tongues;' to another the interpretation of tongues.
28646	46	12	11	 But these results are all brought about by one and the same Spirit, who  bestows His gifts upon each of us in accordance with His own will.
28647	46	12	12	 For just as the human body is one and yet has many parts, and all its parts, many as they are, constitute but one body,  so it is with  the Church of Christ.
28648	46	12	13	 For, in fact, in one Spirit all of us--whether we are Jews or  Gentiles, slaves or free men--were baptized to form but one body; and we were all  nourished by that one Spirit.
28649	46	12	14	 For the human body does not consist of one part, but of many.
28650	46	12	15	 Were the foot to say, "Because I am not a  hand I am not a part of the body," that would not make it any the less a part of the body.
28651	46	12	16	 Or were the ear to say, "Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body," that would not make it any the less a part of the body.
28652	46	12	17	 If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the nostrils be?
28653	46	12	18	 But, as a matter of fact, God has arranged the parts in the body--every one of them--as He has seen fit.
28654	46	12	19	 If they were all one part, where would the body be?
28655	46	12	20	 But, as a matter of fact, there are many parts and but one body.
28656	46	12	21	 It is also impossible for the eye to say to the hand, "I do not need you;" or again for the head to say to the feet, "I do not need you."
28657	46	12	22	 No, it is quite otherwise. Even those parts of the body which are apparently somewhat feeble are yet indispensable;
28658	46	12	23	 and those which we deem less honorable we clothe with more abundant honor; and so our ungraceful parts come to have a more abundant grace, while our graceful parts have everything they need.
28659	46	12	24	 But it was God who  built up the body, and bestowed more abundant honor on the part that felt the need,
28660	46	12	25	 that there might be no disunion in the body, but that all the members might entertain the same anxious care for one another's welfare.
28661	46	12	26	 And if one part is suffering, every other part suffers with it; or if one part is receiving special honor, every other part  shares in the joy.
28662	46	12	27	 As for you, you are the body of Christ, and individually you are members of it.
28663	46	12	28	 And  by God's appointment there are in the Church--first Apostles, secondly  Prophets, thirdly teachers. Then come miraculous powers, and then ability to cure diseases or render loving service, or powers of organization, or varieties of the gift of `tongues.'
28664	46	12	29	 Are all Apostles? Are all Prophets? Are all teachers?
28665	46	12	30	 Have all miraculous powers? Have all ability to cure diseases? Do all speak in `tongues'? Do all interpret?
28666	46	12	31	 But always seek to excel in the greater gifts. And now I will point out to you a way of life which transcends all others.
28667	46	13	1	 If I can speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but am destitute of Love, I have but become a loud-sounding trumpet or a clanging cymbal.
28668	46	13	2	 If I possess the gift of prophecy and am versed in all mysteries and all knowledge, and have such absolute faith that I can remove mountains, but am destitute of Love, I am nothing.
28669	46	13	3	 And if I  distribute all my possessions to the poor, and give up my body  to be burned, but am destitute of Love, it profits me nothing.
28670	46	13	4	 Love is patient and kind. Love knows neither envy nor jealousy.  Love is not forward and self-assertive, nor boastful and conceited.
28671	46	13	5	 She does not behave unbecomingly, nor seek to aggrandize herself, nor blaze out in passionate anger, nor brood over wrongs.
28672	46	13	6	 She finds no pleasure in injustice done to others, but joyfully sides with the truth.
28673	46	13	7	 She knows how to be silent. She is full of trust, full of hope, full of patient endurance.
28674	46	13	8	 Love never fails. But if there are prophecies, they will be  done away with; if there are languages, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be  brought to an end.
28675	46	13	9	 For our knowledge is imperfect, and so is our prophesying;
28676	46	13	10	 but when the perfect state of things is come, all that is imperfect will be brought to an end.
28677	46	13	11	 When I was a child, I talked like a child,  felt like a child, reasoned like a child: when I  became a man,  I  put from me childish ways.
28678	46	13	12	 For the present we see things as if in a mirror,  and are puzzled; but then we shall see them face to face. For the present the knowledge I gain is imperfect; but then I shall know fully, even as  I am fully known.
28679	46	13	13	  And so there remain Faith, Hope, Love--these three; and of these the greatest is Love.
28680	46	14	1	 Be eager in your pursuit of this Love, and be earnestly ambitious for spiritual gifts, but let it be chiefly so in order that you may prophesy.
28681	46	14	2	 For he who speaks in an unknown tongue is not speaking to men, but to God; for no one understands him. Yet in the Spirit he is speaking secret truths.
28682	46	14	3	 But he who  prophesies speaks to men words of edification,  encouragement and comfort.
28683	46	14	4	 He who speaks in an unknown tongue  does good to himself, but he who prophesies  does good to the Church.
28684	46	14	5	 I should be right glad were you all to speak in `tongues,' but yet more glad were you all to prophesy. And, in fact, the man who prophesies is superior to him who speaks in `tongues,' except when the latter  can interpret in order that the Church may get a blessing.
28685	46	14	6	 But, brethren, as things are, if I come to you speaking in `tongues,' what benefit shall I confer on you,  if the utterance is neither in the form of a revelation nor of additional knowledge nor of prophecy nor of teaching?
28686	46	14	7	 Even inanimate things--flutes or harps, for instance--when yielding a sound, if they make no distinction in the notes, how shall the tune which is played on the flute or the harp be known?
28687	46	14	8	 If the bugle--to take another example--gives an uncertain sound, who will prepare for battle?
28688	46	14	9	 And so with you; if with the living voice you fail to utter intelligible words, how will people know what you are saying? You will be talking to the winds.
28689	46	14	10	 There are, we will suppose, a great number of languages in the world, and no creature is without a language.
28690	46	14	11	 If, however, I do not know the meaning of the particular language, I shall seem to the speaker of it, and he to me, to be merely talking some foreign tongue.
28691	46	14	12	 Therefore, seeing that you are ambitious for spiritual gifts, seek to excel in them so as to  benefit the Church.
28692	46	14	13	 Therefore let a man who has the gift of tongues pray for the power of interpreting them.
28693	46	14	14	 For if I pray in an unknown tongue,  my spirit prays, but my understanding is barren.
28694	46	14	15	 How then does the matter stand? I will pray in spirit, and I will pray with my understanding also. I will  praise God in spirit, and I will praise Him with my understanding also.
28695	46	14	16	 Otherwise, if you bless God in spirit only, how shall he who is in the position of an ungifted man say the `Amen' to your giving of thanks, when he does not know what your words mean?
28696	46	14	17	 Rightly enough you are giving thanks, and yet your neighbor is not  benefited.
28697	46	14	18	 I speak in a tongue, thank God, more than all of you;
28698	46	14	19	 but in the Church I would rather speak five words with my understanding--so as to instruct others also--than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.
28699	46	14	20	 Brethren, do not prove yourselves to be children in your minds. As regards evil, indeed, be utter babes, but as regards your minds prove yourselves to be men of ripe years.
28700	46	14	21	 In the Law it stands written, <"`By men of unknown tongues and by the lips of an unknown nation will I speak to this People, but even then they will not listen to Me',> says the Lord."
28701	46	14	22	 This shows that the gift of tongues is intended as a sign not to those who believe but to unbelievers, but  prophecy is intended not for unbelievers but for those who believe.
28702	46	14	23	 Accordingly if the whole Church has assembled and all are speaking in `tongues,' and there come in ungifted men, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are all mad?
28703	46	14	24	 If, on the other hand, every one is prophesying and an unbeliever or an ungifted man comes in, he is convicted by all and closely examined by all,
28704	46	14	25	 and the hidden evils of his heart are brought to light. And, as the result, he will fall on his face and worship God, and will report to others that of a truth God is among you.
28705	46	14	26	 What then, brethren? Whenever you assemble, there is not one of you who is not ready either with a song of praise, a sermon, a revelation, a `tongue,' or an interpretation. Let everything be done with a view to the  building up of faith and character.
28706	46	14	27	 If there is speaking in an unknown tongue, only two or at the most three should speak, and they should do so one at a time, and one should interpret;
28707	46	14	28	 or if there is no interpreter, let the man with the gift be silent in the Church, speaking to himself and to God.
28708	46	14	29	 But if there are Prophets, let two or three speak and let the rest  judge.
28709	46	14	30	 And if anything is revealed to some one else who is  seated there, let the first be silent.
28710	46	14	31	 For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged:
28711	46	14	32	 and the spirits of Prophets yield submission to Prophets.
28712	46	14	33	 For God is not a God of disorder, but of peace,  as He is in all the Churches of His people.
28713	46	14	34	 Let  married women be silent in the Churches, for they are not permitted to speak. They must be content with a subordinate place, as the Law also says;
28714	46	14	35	 and if they wish to ask questions, they should ask  their own husbands at home. For it is disgraceful for a married woman to speak at a Church assembly.
28715	46	14	36	  Was it from you that God's Message first went forth, or is it to you only that it has come?
28716	46	14	37	 If any one deems himself to be a Prophet or a man with spiritual gifts,  let him recognize as the Lord's command all that I am now writing to you.
28717	46	14	38	 But if any one is ignorant,  let him be ignorant.
28718	46	14	39	 The conclusion, my brethren, is this. Be earnestly ambitious to prophesy, and do not check speaking with tongues;
28719	46	14	40	 only let everything be done in a becoming and orderly manner.
28720	46	15	1	 But let me recall to you, brethren, the Good News which I brought you, which you accepted, and on which you are standing,
28721	46	15	2	 through which also you are obtaining salvation, if you bear in mind the words in which I proclaimed it--unless indeed your faith has been unreal  from the very first.
28722	46	15	3	 For I repeated to you the all-important fact which also I had been taught, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures;
28723	46	15	4	 that He was buried; that He rose to life again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,
28724	46	15	5	 and was seen by  Peter, and then by the Twelve.
28725	46	15	6	 Afterwards He was seen by more than five hundred brethren  at once, most of whom are still alive, although some of them have now fallen asleep.
28726	46	15	7	 Afterwards He was seen by James, and then by all the Apostles.
28727	46	15	8	 And last of all, as to one of untimely birth, He appeared to me also.
28728	46	15	9	 For I am  the least of the Apostles, and am not fit to be called an Apostle--because I persecuted the Church of God.
28729	46	15	10	 But what I am I am by the grace of God, and His grace bestowed upon me did not prove ineffectual. But I labored more strenuously than all the rest--yet it was not I, but God's grace working with me.
28730	46	15	11	 But whether it is I or they, this is the way we preach and the way that you came to believe.
28731	46	15	12	 But if Christ is preached as having risen from the dead, how is it that some of you say that there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead?
28732	46	15	13	 If there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead, then Christ Himself has not risen to life.
28733	46	15	14	 And if Christ has not risen, it follows that what we preach is a delusion, and that your faith also is  a delusion.
28734	46	15	15	 Nay more, we are actually being discovered to be bearing false witness about God, because we have testified that God raised Christ to life, whom He did not raise, if in reality none of the dead are raised.
28735	46	15	16	 For if none of the dead are raised to life, then Christ has not risen;
28736	46	15	17	 and if Christ has not risen, your faith is  a vain thing--you are still in your sins.
28737	46	15	18	 It follows also that those who  have fallen asleep in Christ  have perished.
28738	46	15	19	 If in this present life we  have a *hope* resting on Christ,  and nothing more, we are more to be pitied than all the rest of the world.
28739	46	15	20	 But, in reality, Christ *has* risen from among the dead, being the first to do so of those who are asleep.
28740	46	15	21	 For seeing that death came through man, through man comes also the resurrection of the dead.
28741	46	15	22	 For just as through Adam all die, so also through Christ all will be made alive again.
28742	46	15	23	 But this will happen to each in the right order--Christ having been the first to rise, and afterwards Christ's people rising at His return.
28743	46	15	24	  Later on, comes  the End, when He is to surrender the Kingship  to God, the Father, when He shall have  overthrown all other government and all other authority and power.
28744	46	15	25	 For He must continue King until  He shall have put all His enemies under His feet.
28745	46	15	26	 The last enemy that is to be  overthrown is Death;
28746	46	15	27	 for He  will have put all things in subjection under His feet. And when He shall have declared that "All things  are in subjection," it will be with the manifest exception of Him who has reduced them all to subjection to Him.
28747	46	15	28	 But when the whole universe has been made subject to Him, then the Son Himself will also become subject to Him who has made the universe subject to Him, in order that GOD may be  all in all.
28748	46	15	29	  Otherwise  what will become of those who got themselves baptized for the dead? If the dead do not rise at all,  why are these baptized for them?
28749	46	15	30	 Why also do  we Apostles expose ourselves to danger every hour?
28750	46	15	31	 I protest, brethren, as surely as I glory over you--which I may justly do in Christ Jesus our Lord--that I die day by day.
28751	46	15	32	 If from merely human motives I  have fought with  wild beasts in Ephesus, what profit is it to me? If the dead do not rise, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we are to die.
28752	46	15	33	 Do not deceive yourselves: "Evil companionships corrupt good morals."
28753	46	15	34	 Wake from this drunken fit; live righteous lives, and cease to sin; for some have no knowledge of God: I speak thus in order to move you to shame.
28754	46	15	35	 But some one will say, "How can the dead rise? And with what kind of body do they come back?"
28755	46	15	36	  Foolish man! the seed you yourself sow has no life given to it unless it first dies;
28756	46	15	37	 and as for what you sow, it is not the plant which is to be that you are sowing, but a bare grain, of wheat (it may be) or of something else, and God gives it a body as He has seen fit,
28757	46	15	38	 and to each kind of seed a body of its own.
28758	46	15	39	 All flesh is not the same: there is human flesh, and flesh of cattle, of birds, and of fishes.
28759	46	15	40	 There are bodies which are celestial and there are bodies which are earthly, but the glory of the celestial ones is one thing, and that of the earthly ones is another.
28760	46	15	41	 There is one glory of the sun, another of the moon, and another of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.
28761	46	15	42	  It is the same with the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown in a state of decay, it is raised free from decay;
28762	46	15	43	 it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;
28763	46	15	44	  an  animal body is sown, a spiritual body is raised.  As surely as there is an animal body, so there is also a spiritual body.
28764	46	15	45	 In the same way also it is written, <"The first man Adam became a living animal";> the last Adam is a life-giving Spirit.
28765	46	15	46	 Nevertheless, it is not what is spiritual that came first, but what is animal; what is spiritual came afterwards.
28766	46	15	47	 The first man is a man of earth, earthy; the second man is from Heaven.
28767	46	15	48	 What the earthy one is, that also are those who are earthy; and what the heavenly One is, that also are those who are heavenly.
28768	46	15	49	 And as we have borne a resemblance to the earthy one, let us see to it that we also bear a resemblance to the heavenly One.
28769	46	15	50	 But this I tell you, brethren:  our mortal bodies cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, nor will what is perishable inherit what is imperishable.
28770	46	15	51	 I tell you  a truth hitherto kept secret: we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
28771	46	15	52	 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the sounding of  the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incapable of decay, and *we* shall be changed.
28772	46	15	53	 For so it must be: this perishable nature must clothe itself with what is imperishable, and this mortality must clothe itself with immortality.
28773	46	15	54	 But when this perishable nature has put on what is imperishable, and this mortality has put on immortality, then will the words of Scripture be fulfilled, <"Death has been swallowed up in victory.">
28774	46	15	55	 <"Where, O death, is thy victory? Where, O death, is thy  sting?">
28775	46	15	56	 Now sin is the sting of death, and sin derives its power from the Law;
28776	46	15	57	 but God be thanked who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!
28777	46	15	58	 Therefore, my dear brethren, be firm, unmovable, busily occupied at all times in the Lord's work, knowing that your toil is not fruitless  in the Lord.
28778	46	16	1	 As to the collection for God's people, what I have directed the Churches of Galatia to do, you must do also.
28779	46	16	2	 On the first day of every week let each of you put on one side and store up at his home  whatever gain has been granted to him; so that whenever I come, there may then be no collections going on.
28780	46	16	3	 And when I am with you, whatever brethren you accredit by letter I will send to carry your kind gift to Jerusalem.
28781	46	16	4	 And if it is worth while for me also to make the journey, they shall go as my companions.
28782	46	16	5	 I shall come to you after passing through Macedonia; for my plan will be to pass through Macedonia;
28783	46	16	6	 and I shall make some stay with you perhaps, or even spend the winter with you, in order that you may help me forward, whichever way I travel.
28784	46	16	7	 For I do not wish to see you on this occasion merely in passing; but if the Lord permits, I hope to remain some time with you.
28785	46	16	8	 I shall remain in Ephesus, however, until  the time of the Harvest Festival,
28786	46	16	9	 for a wide door stands open before me which demands great efforts, and we have many opponents.
28787	46	16	10	 If Timothy pays you a visit, see that he is free from fear in his relations with you; for he is engaged in the Master's work just as I am.
28788	46	16	11	 Therefore let no one slight him, but all of you should help him forward in peace to join me; for I am waiting for him and  others of the brethren.
28789	46	16	12	 As for our brother Apollos, I have repeatedly urged him to accompany the brethren who are  coming to you: but he is quite resolved not to do so at present. He will come, however, when he has a good opportunity.
28790	46	16	13	  Be on the alert; stand firm in the faith; acquit yourselves like men; be strong.
28791	46	16	14	 Let all that you do be done  from motives of love.
28792	46	16	15	 And I beseech you, brethren--you know the household of Stephanas, how they were the earliest Greek converts to Christ, and have devoted themselves to the service of God's people--
28793	46	16	16	 I beseech you, on your part, to show deference to such men, and to every one who participates in their work and toils hard.
28794	46	16	17	 It is a joy to me that Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus have now arrived, because  what was wanting so far as you are concerned they have supplied.
28795	46	16	18	 They have refreshed my spirit,  and yours. Acknowledge such men as these.
28796	46	16	19	 The Churches in the province of Asia send you greetings; and Aquila and Prisca, in hearty Christian love, do the same, together with the Church which meets  at their house.
28797	46	16	20	 The brethren all send greetings to you. Greet one another  with a holy kiss.
28798	46	16	21	 The final greeting of me--Paul--with my own hand.
28799	46	16	22	 If any one is destitute of love to the Lord, let him be accursed.  OUR LORD IS COMING.
28800	46	16	23	 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
28801	46	16	24	 My love in Christ Jesus be with you all.
28802	47	1	1	 Paul, an Apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God--and our brother Timothy: To the Church of God in Corinth, with all God's people throughout  Greece.
28803	47	1	2	 May grace and peace be granted to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
28804	47	1	3	 Heartfelt thanks be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ--the  Father who is full of compassion and the God who gives all  comfort.
28805	47	1	4	 He comforts us in our every affliction so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any kind of affliction by means of the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
28806	47	1	5	 For just as we have more than our share of suffering for the Christ, so also through the Christ we have more than our share of comfort.
28807	47	1	6	 But if, on the one hand, we are enduring affliction, it is  for your comfort and salvation; and if, on the other hand, we are receiving comfort, it is for your comfort which is produced within you through your patient fortitude under the same sufferings as those which we also are enduring.
28808	47	1	7	 And our hope for you is stedfast; for we know that as you are partners with us in the sufferings, so you are also partners in the comfort.
28809	47	1	8	 For as for our troubles which came upon us in  the province of Asia, we would have you know, brethren, that we were exceedingly weighed down,  and felt overwhelmed, so that we renounced all hope even of life.
28810	47	1	9	 Nay, we had, as we still have, the  sentence of death within our own selves, in order that our confidence may repose, not on ourselves, but on God who raised the dead to life.
28811	47	1	10	 He it is who rescued us from so imminent a death, and will do so again; and we have a firm hope in Him that He will also rescue us in all the future,
28812	47	1	11	 while you on your part lend us your aid in entreaty for us, so that from many lips thanksgivings may rise on our behalf for the boon granted to us at the intercession of many.
28813	47	1	12	 For the reason for our boasting is this--the testimony of our own conscience that it was in holiness and with  pure motives before God, and in reliance not on worldly wisdom but on the gracious help of God, that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and above all in our relations with you.
28814	47	1	13	 For we are writing to you nothing different from what we have written before, or from what indeed you already recognize as truth and will, I trust, recognize as such to the very end;
28815	47	1	14	 just as some few of you have recognized us as your reason for boasting, even as you will be ours, on the day of Jesus our Lord.
28816	47	1	15	 It was because I entertained this confidence that I intended to visit you  before going elsewhere--so that you might receive a twofold  proof of God's favour--
28817	47	1	16	 and to pass by way of Corinth into Macedonia. Then my plan was to return from Macedonia to you, and be helped forward by you to Judaea.
28818	47	1	17	 Did I display any  vacillation or caprice in this? Or the purposes which I form--do I form them on worldly principles, now crying "Yes, yes," and now "No, no"?
28819	47	1	18	 As certainly as God is faithful, our language to you is not now "Yes" and now "No."
28820	47	1	19	 For Jesus Christ the Son of God--He who was proclaimed among you by us, that is by  Silas and Timothy and myself--did not show Himself a waverer between "Yes" and "No." But it  was and always is "Yes" with Him.
28821	47	1	20	 For all the promises of God, whatever their number, have  their confirmation in Him; and for this reason through Him also our "Amen" acknowledges their truth  and promotes the glory of God through our faith.
28822	47	1	21	 But He who is making us as well as you stedfast through union with  the Anointed One, and has anointed us, is God,
28823	47	1	22	 and He has also set His seal upon us, and has  put  His Spirit into our hearts as a pledge and foretaste of future blessing.
28824	47	1	23	 But as for me, as my soul shall answer for it, I appeal to God as my witness, that it was to spare you pain that I gave up my visit to Corinth.
28825	47	1	24	  Not that we want to lord it over you in respect of your faith--we do, however, desire to help your joy--for in the matter of your faith you are standing firm.
28826	47	2	1	 But, so far as I am concerned, I have resolved not to have a painful visit the next time I come to see you.
28827	47	2	2	 For if I of all men give you pain, who then is there to gladden my heart, but the very persons to whom I give pain?
28828	47	2	3	 And I write this to you in order that when I come I may not receive pain from those who ought to give me joy, confident as I am as to all of you that my joy is the joy of you all.
28829	47	2	4	 For with many tears I write to you, and in deep suffering and depression of spirit, not in order to grieve you, but in the hope of showing you how brimful my heart is with love for you.
28830	47	2	5	 Now if any one has caused sorrow, it has been caused not so much to me, as in some degree--for I have no wish to exaggerate--to all of you.
28831	47	2	6	 In the case of such a person the punishment which was inflicted by the majority of you is enough.
28832	47	2	7	 So that you may now take the opposite course, and forgive him  rather and comfort him, for fear he should perhaps be driven to despair by his excess of grief.
28833	47	2	8	 I beg you therefore fully to reinstate him in your love.
28834	47	2	9	 For in writing to you I have also this object in view--to discover by experience whether you are prepared to be obedient in every respect.
28835	47	2	10	 When you forgive a man an offence I also forgive it; for in fact what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has always been for your sakes in the presence of Christ,
28836	47	2	11	 for fear Satan should gain an advantage over us. For we are not ignorant of his  devices.
28837	47	2	12	 Now when I came into  the Troad to spread there the Good News about the Christ, even though in the Lord's providence a door stood open before me,
28838	47	2	13	 yet, obtaining no relief for my spirit because I did not find our brother Titus, I bade them farewell and went on into Macedonia.
28839	47	2	14	 But to God be the thanks who in Christ ever heads our  triumphal procession, and by our hands waves in every place that sweet incense, the knowledge of Him.
28840	47	2	15	 For we are a fragrance of Christ grateful to God in those  whom He is saving and in those who are perishing;
28841	47	2	16	 to the last-named an odor of death predictive of death, and to the others an odor of life predictive of life. And for such service as this who is competent?
28842	47	2	17	  We are; for,  unlike most teachers, we are not fraudulent hucksters of God's Message; but with  transparent motives, as commissioned by God, in God's presence and in communion with Christ, so we speak.
28843	47	3	1	 Do you say that this is self-recommendation once more? Or do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you or from you?
28844	47	3	2	 Our letter of recommendation is yourselves--a letter written on our hearts and everywhere known and read.
28845	47	3	3	 For all can see that you are a letter of Christ entrusted to our care, and written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the  ever-living God--and not on tablets of stone, but on  human hearts as tablets.
28846	47	3	4	 Such is the confidence which we have through Christ in the presence of God;
28847	47	3	5	 not that of ourselves we are competent to decide anything by our own reasonings, but our competency comes from God.
28848	47	3	6	 It is He also who has made us competent to serve Him in connexion with a new  Covenant, which is not a written code but a Spirit; for the written code inflicts death, but the Spirit gives Life.
28849	47	3	7	 If, however, the service  that proclaims death--its code being engraved in writing upon stones--came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look steadily on the face of Moses because of the brightness of his face--a vanishing brightness;
28850	47	3	8	 will not the service of the Spirit be far more glorious?
28851	47	3	9	 For if the service which pronounces doom  had glory, far more glorious still is the service which tells of righteousness.
28852	47	3	10	 For, in fact, that which was once resplendent in glory has no glory at all in this respect, that it pales before the glory which surpasses it.
28853	47	3	11	 For if that which was to be abolished came with glory, much more is that which is permanent arrayed in glory.
28854	47	3	12	 Therefore, cherishing a hope like this, we speak without reserve, and we do not imitate Moses,
28855	47	3	13	 who used to throw a veil over his face to hide from the gaze of the children of Israel the passing away of what was but transitory.
28856	47	3	14	 Nay, their minds were made dull; for to this very day during the reading of the book of the  ancient Covenant, the same veil  remains unlifted, because it is only in Christ that it is to be abolished.
28857	47	3	15	 Yes, to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies upon their  hearts.
28858	47	3	16	 But whenever  the heart of the nation shall have returned to the Lord, the veil will be withdrawn.
28859	47	3	17	 Now by "the Lord" is meant the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is,  freedom is enjoyed.
28860	47	3	18	 And all of us, with unveiled faces, reflecting like bright mirrors the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same likeness, from one degree of radiant holiness to another, even as derived from the Lord the Spirit.
28861	47	4	1	 Therefore, being engaged in this service and being mindful of the mercy which has been shown us, we are not cowards.
28862	47	4	2	 Nay, we have renounced the secrecy which marks a feeling of shame. We practice no cunning tricks, nor do we adulterate God's Message. But by a full clear statement of the truth we strive to commend ourselves in the presence of God to every human conscience.
28863	47	4	3	 If, however, the meaning of our Good News has been veiled,  the veil has been on the hearts of those who are on the way to perdition,
28864	47	4	4	 in whom the god of this present age has blinded their unbelieving minds so as to shut out the sunshine of the Good News of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God.
28865	47	4	5	 (For we do not proclaim ourselves, but we proclaim Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your bondservants for the sake of Jesus.)
28866	47	4	6	 For God who said, "Out of darkness let light shine," is He who has shone in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God's glory, which is radiant on the face of Christ.
28867	47	4	7	 But we have  this treasure in  a fragile vase of clay, in order that the surpassing greatness of the power may be seen to belong to God, and not to originate in us.
28868	47	4	8	  We are hard pressed, yet never in absolute distress; perplexed, yet never utterly baffled;
28869	47	4	9	 pursued, yet never left unsuccoured; struck to the ground, yet never slain;
28870	47	4	10	 always, wherever we go, carrying with us in our bodies the putting to death of Jesus, so that in our bodies it may also be clearly shown that Jesus lives.
28871	47	4	11	 For we, alive though we are, are continually surrendering ourselves to death for the sake of Jesus, so that in this mortal nature of ours it may also be clearly shown that Jesus lives.
28872	47	4	12	 Thus we are constantly dying, while you are in full enjoyment of Life.
28873	47	4	13	 But possessing the same Spirit of faith as he who wrote, <"I believed, and therefore I have spoken,"> we also believe, and therefore we speak.
28874	47	4	14	 For we know that He who  raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will raise us also to be with Jesus, and will cause  both us and you to stand in His own presence.
28875	47	4	15	 For  everything is for your sakes, in order that grace, being more richly bestowed because of the thanksgivings of the increased number, may more and more promote the glory of God.
28876	47	4	16	 Therefore we are not cowards. Nay, even though our outward man is wasting away, yet our inward man is being renewed day by day.
28877	47	4	17	 For this  our light and transitory burden of suffering is achieving for us a preponderating, yes, a vastly preponderating, and eternal weight of glory;
28878	47	4	18	 while  we look not at things seen, but things unseen; for things seen are temporary, but things unseen are eternal.
28879	47	5	1	 For we know that if this poor tent, our earthly house, is taken down, we have in Heaven a building which God has provided, a house not built by human hands, but eternal.
28880	47	5	2	 For in this one we sigh, because we long to put on over it our dwelling which comes from Heaven--
28881	47	5	3	  if indeed having really put on a  robe we shall not be found to be unclothed.
28882	47	5	4	 Yes, we who are in this tent certainly do sigh under our burdens, for  we do not wish to lay aside that with which we are now clothed, but to put on more, so that our mortality may be  absorbed in Life.
28883	47	5	5	 And He who formed us with this very end in view is God, who has given us His Spirit as  a pledge and foretaste of that bliss.
28884	47	5	6	 We have therefore a cheerful confidence. We know that while we are at home in the body we are banished from the Lord;
28885	47	5	7	 for we are living a life of faith, and not one of sight.
28886	47	5	8	 So we have a cheerful confidence, and we anticipate with greater delight being banished from the body and going home to the Lord.
28887	47	5	9	 And for this reason also we make it our ambition, whether at home or in exile, to please Him perfectly.
28888	47	5	10	 For we must all of us appear before Christ's judgement-seat in our true characters, in order that each may then receive an award for his actions in this life, in accordance with what he has done, whether it be good or whether it be  worthless.
28889	47	5	11	 Therefore, because we realize how greatly the Lord is to be feared, we are endeavouring to win men over, and God recognizes what our motives are, and I hope that you, in your hearts, recognize them too.
28890	47	5	12	 We are not again commending ourselves to your favour, but are furnishing you with a ground of boasting on our behalf, so that you may have a reply ready for those with whom superficial appearances are everything and sincerity of heart counts for nothing.
28891	47	5	13	 For if we have been beside ourselves, it has been for God's glory; or if we are now in our right senses, it is in order to be of service to you.
28892	47	5	14	 For the love of Christ overmasters us, the conclusion at which we have arrived being this--that One having died for all, His death was their death,
28893	47	5	15	 and that He died for all in order that the living may no longer live to themselves, but to Him who died for them and rose again.
28894	47	5	16	 Therefore for the future we know no one simply as a man. Even if we have known Christ as a man, yet now we do so no longer.
28895	47	5	17	 So that if any one is in Christ,  he is a new creature: the old state of things has passed away; a new state of things has come into existence.
28896	47	5	18	 And all this is from God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Christ, and has appointed us to serve in the ministry of reconciliation.
28897	47	5	19	 We are to tell how God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not charging men's transgressions to their account, and that He has entrusted  to us the Message of this reconciliation.
28898	47	5	20	 On Christ's behalf therefore we come as ambassadors, God, as it were, making entreaty through our lips: we, on Christ's behalf, beseech men to be reconciled to God.
28899	47	5	21	 He has made Him who knew nothing of sin to be sin for us, in order that in Him we may become the righteousness of God.
28900	47	6	1	 And you also we, as God's fellow workers, entreat not to be found to have received His grace to no purpose.
28901	47	6	2	 For He says, <"At a time of welcome I have listened to you, and on a day of salvation I have succoured you."> Now is the time of loving welcome! Now is the day of salvation!
28902	47	6	3	  We endeavour to give people no cause for stumbling in anything, lest the work we are doing should fall into discredit.
28903	47	6	4	 On the contrary, as God's servants, we seek their full approval--by unwearied endurance, by afflictions, by distress, by helplessness;
28904	47	6	5	 by floggings, by imprisonments; by facing riots, by toil, by sleepless watching, by hunger and thirst;
28905	47	6	6	 by purity of life, by knowledge, by patience, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love;
28906	47	6	7	 by the proclamation of the truth, by the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness, wielded in both hands;
28907	47	6	8	 through honour and ignominy, through calumny and praise. We are looked upon as impostors and yet are true men;
28908	47	6	9	 as obscure persons, and yet are well known; as on the point of death, and yet, strange to tell, we live; as under God's discipline, and yet we are not deprived of life;
28909	47	6	10	 as sad, but we are always joyful; as poor, but we bestow wealth on many; as having nothing, and yet we securely possess all things.
28910	47	6	11	 O Corinthians, our lips are unsealed to you: our heart is expanded.
28911	47	6	12	 There is no narrowness in our love to you: the narrowness is in your own feelings.
28912	47	6	13	 And in just requital--I speak as to my children--let your hearts expand also.
28913	47	6	14	 Do not come into close association with unbelievers, like oxen yoked with asses. For what is there in common between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what partnership has light with darkness?
28914	47	6	15	 Where can harmony between Christ and Belial be found? Or what participation has a believer with an unbeliever?
28915	47	6	16	 And what compact has the Temple of God with idols? For *we* are the Temple of the  ever-living God; as God has said, <"I will dwell among them, and walk about among them; and will be their God, and it is they who shall be My people.">
28916	47	6	17	 Therefore, <"`Come out from among them and separate yourselves,' says the Lord, `and touch nothing impure; and I will receive you, and will be a Father to you,
28917	47	6	18	 and you shall be My sons and daughters,' says the Lord the Ruler of all.">
28918	47	7	1	 Having therefore these promises, beloved friends, let us purify ourselves from all defilement of body and of spirit, and secure perfect holiness through the fear of God.
28919	47	7	2	 Make room for us in your hearts. There is not one of you whom we have wronged, not one to whom we have done harm, not one over whom we have gained any selfish advantage.
28920	47	7	3	 I do not say this  to imply blame, for, as I have already said, you have such a place in our hearts that we would die with you or live with you.
28921	47	7	4	 I have great confidence in you: very loudly do I boast of you. I am filled with comfort: my heart overflows with joy amid all our affliction.
28922	47	7	5	 For even after our arrival in Macedonia we could get no relief such as human nature craves. We were greatly harassed; there were conflicts without and fears within.
28923	47	7	6	 But He who comforts the depressed--even God--  comforted us by the coming of Titus, and not by his coming only,
28924	47	7	7	 but also by the fact that he had felt comforted on your account, and by the report which he brought of your eager affection, of your grief, and of your jealousy on my behalf, so that I rejoiced more than ever.
28925	47	7	8	 For if I gave you pain by that letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret it then.  I see that that letter, even though for a time it gave you pain,  had a salutary effect.
28926	47	7	9	 Now I rejoice, not in your grief, but because the grief led to repentance; for you sorrowed with a godly sorrow, which prevented you from receiving injury from us in any respect.
28927	47	7	10	 For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, a repentance not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world finally produces death.
28928	47	7	11	 For mark the effects of this very thing--your having sorrowed with a godly sorrow--what earnestness it has called forth in you,  what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing affection, what jealousy, what meting out of justice! You have completely wiped away reproach from yourselves in the matter.
28929	47	7	12	 Therefore, though I wrote to you, it was not to punish the offender, nor to secure justice for him who had suffered the wrong, but it was chiefly in order that your earnest feeling on our behalf might become manifest to yourselves in the sight of God.
28930	47	7	13	 For this reason we feel comforted; and--in addition to this our comfort--we have been filled with all the deeper joy at Titus's joy, because his spirit  has been set at rest by you all.
28931	47	7	14	 For however I may have boasted to him about you, I have no reason to feel ashamed; but as we have in all respects spoken the truth to you, so also our boasting to Titus about you has turned out to be the truth.
28932	47	7	15	 And his strong and tender affection is all the more drawn out towards you when he recalls to mind  the obedience which all of you manifested by the timidity and nervous anxiety with which you welcomed him.
28933	47	7	16	 I rejoice that I have absolute confidence in you.
28934	47	8	1	 But we desire to let you know, brethren, of the grace of God which has been bestowed on the Churches of Macedonia;
28935	47	8	2	 how, while passing through great trouble, their boundless joy even amid their deep poverty has overflowed to increase their generous liberality.
28936	47	8	3	 For I can testify that to the utmost of their power, and even beyond their power, they have of their own free will given help.
28937	47	8	4	 With earnest entreaty they begged from us the  favour of being allowed to share in the service now being rendered to God's people.
28938	47	8	5	 They not only did this, as we had expected, but first of all in obedience to God's will they gave  their own selves to the Lord and to us.
28939	47	8	6	 This led us to urge Titus that, as he had previously been the one who commenced the work, so he should now go and complete among you this act of beneficence also.
28940	47	8	7	 Yes, just as you are already  very rich in faith, readiness of speech, knowledge, unwearied zeal, and in the love  that is in you, implanted by us, see to it that this grace of liberal giving also flourishes in you.
28941	47	8	8	 I am not saying this by way of command, but to test by the standard of other men's earnestness the genuineness of your love also.
28942	47	8	9	 For you know the condescending goodness of our Lord Jesus Christ--how for your sakes He became poor, though He was rich, in order that you through His poverty might grow rich.
28943	47	8	10	 But in this matter I give you an opinion; for my doing this helps forward your own intentions, seeing that not only have you begun operations, but a year ago you already had the desire to do so.
28944	47	8	11	 And now complete the doing also, in order that, just as there was then the eagerness in desiring, there may now be the accomplishment in proportion to your means.
28945	47	8	12	 For, assuming the earnest willingness, the gift is acceptable according to whatever a man has, and not according to what he has not.
28946	47	8	13	 I do not urge you to give in order that others may have relief while you are unduly pressed,
28947	47	8	14	 but that, by equalization of burdens, your superfluity having in the present emergency supplied their deficiency, their superfluity may in turn be a supply for your deficiency later on, so that there may be equalization of burdens.
28948	47	8	15	 Even as it is written, <"He who gathered much had not  too much, and he who gathered little had not  too little.">
28949	47	8	16	 But thanks be to God that He inspires the heart of Titus with the same deep interest in you;
28950	47	8	17	 for Titus welcomed our request, and, being thoroughly in earnest, comes to you of his own free will.
28951	47	8	18	 And we send with him the brother whose  praises for his earnestness in proclaiming the Good News are heard throughout all the Churches.
28952	47	8	19	 And more than that, he is the one who was chosen by the  vote of the Churches to travel with us, sharing our commission in the administration of this generous gift to promote the Lord's glory and gratify our own strong desire.
28953	47	8	20	 For against one thing we are on our guard--I mean against blame being thrown upon us in respect to these large and liberal contributions which are under our charge.
28954	47	8	21	 For we seek not only God's approval of our integrity, but man's also.
28955	47	8	22	 And we send with them our brother, of whose zeal we have had frequent proof in many matters, and who is now more zealous than ever through the strong confidence which he has in you.
28956	47	8	23	 As for Titus, remember that he is a partner with me, and is my comrade in my labours for you. And as for our brethren, remember that they are  delegates from the Churches, and are men in whom Christ is glorified.
28957	47	8	24	 Exhibit therefore to the Churches a proof of your love, and a justification of our boasting to these brethren about you.
28958	47	9	1	 As to the services which are being rendered to God's people, it is really unnecessary for me to write to you.
28959	47	9	2	 For I know your earnest willingness, on account of which I habitually boast of you to the Macedonians, pointing out to them that for a whole year you in Greece have been ready; and the greater number of them have been spurred on by your ardour.
28960	47	9	3	 Still I send the brethren in order that in this matter our boast about you may not turn out to have been an idle one; so that, as I have said, you may be ready;
28961	47	9	4	 for fear that, if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we--not to say you yourselves--should be put to the blush in respect to this confidence.
28962	47	9	5	 I have thought it absolutely necessary therefore to request these brethren to visit you before I myself come, and to make sure beforehand that the  gift of love which you have already promised may be ready as a gift of love, and may not seem to have been something which I have extorted from you.
28963	47	9	6	 But do not forget that he who sows with a niggardly hand will also reap a niggardly crop, and that he who sows  bountifully will also reap bountifully.
28964	47	9	7	 Let each contribute  what he has decided upon in his own mind, and not do it reluctantly or under compulsion. <"It is a cheerful giver that God loves.">
28965	47	9	8	 And God is able to bestow every blessing on you in abundance, so that  richly enjoying all sufficiency at all times, you may have ample means for all good works.
28966	47	9	9	 As it is written, <"He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor, his  almsgiving remains for ever.">
28967	47	9	10	 And God who  continually supplies seed for the sower and bread for eating,  will supply you with seed and multiply it, and will cause your almsgiving to yield a plentiful harvest.
28968	47	9	11	 May you be  abundantly enriched so as to show all liberality, such as through our instrumentality brings thanksgiving to God.
28969	47	9	12	 For the service rendered in this sacred gift not only helps to relieve the wants of God's people, but it is also rich in its results and awakens a chorus of thanksgiving to God.
28970	47	9	13	  For,  by the practical proof of it which you exhibit in this service, you cause God to be extolled for your  fidelity to your professed adherence to the Good News of the Christ, and for the liberality of your contributions for them and for  all who are in need,
28971	47	9	14	 while they themselves also in supplications on your behalf pour out their longing love towards you because of God's surpassing grace which is resting upon you.
28972	47	9	15	 Thanks be to God for His  unspeakably precious  gift!
28973	47	10	1	 But as for me Paul, I entreat you by the gentleness and self-forgetfulness of Christ--I who when among you have not an imposing personal presence, but when absent am fearlessly outspoken in dealing with you.
28974	47	10	2	 I beseech you not to compel me when present to make a bold display of the confidence with which I reckon I shall show my `courage' against some who reckon that we are guided by worldly principles.
28975	47	10	3	 For, though we are still living in the world, it is no worldly warfare that we are waging.
28976	47	10	4	 The weapons with which we fight are not human weapons, but are mighty for God in overthrowing strong fortresses.
28977	47	10	5	 For we overthrow arrogant `reckonings,' and every stronghold that towers high in defiance of the knowledge of God, and we carry off every thought as if into slavery--into subjection to Christ;
28978	47	10	6	 while we hold ourselves in readiness to punish every act of disobedience, as soon as ever you  as a Church have fully shown your obedience.
28979	47	10	7	 Is it outward appearances you look to? If any man is confident as regards himself that he specially belongs to Christ, let him consider again and reflect that just as he belongs to Christ, so also do we.
28980	47	10	8	 If, however, I were to boast more loudly of our  Apostolic authority, which the Lord has given us that we may build you up, not  pull you down, I should have no reason to feel ashamed.
28981	47	10	9	 Let it not seem as if I wanted to frighten you by my letters.
28982	47	10	10	 For they say "His letters are authoritative and forcible, but his personal presence is unimpressive, and as for eloquence, he has none."
28983	47	10	11	 Let such people take this into their reckoning, that whatever we are in word by our letters when absent, the same are we also in act when present.
28984	47	10	12	 For we have not the `courage' to rank ourselves among, or compare ourselves with, certain persons distinguished by their self-commendation. Yet they are not wise, measuring themselves, as they do, by one another and comparing themselves with one another.
28985	47	10	13	 We, however, will not exceed due limits in our boasting, but will keep within the limits of the sphere which God has assigned to us as a limit, which reaches even to you.
28986	47	10	14	 For there is no undue stretch of authority on our part, as though it did not extend to you. We pressed on even to Corinth, and were the first to proclaim to you the Good News of the Christ.
28987	47	10	15	 We do not exceed our due limits, and take credit for other men's labours; but we entertain the hope that, as your faith grows, we shall gain promotion among you--still keeping within our own sphere--promotion to a larger field of labour,
28988	47	10	16	 and shall tell the Good News in the districts beyond you, not boasting in another man's sphere about work already done by him.
28989	47	10	17	 But <"whoever boasts, let his boast be in the Lord.">
28990	47	10	18	 For it is not the man that commends himself who is really approved, but he whom the Lord commends.
28991	47	11	1	 I wish you could have borne with a little  foolish boasting on my part. Nay, do bear with me.
28992	47	11	2	 I am jealous over you with God's own jealousy. For I have betrothed you to Christ to present you to Him like a faithful bride to her one husband.
28993	47	11	3	 But I am afraid that, as the serpent in his craftiness deceived Eve, so your minds may be led astray from their single-heartedness and their fidelity to Christ.
28994	47	11	4	 If indeed  some visitor is proclaiming among you another Jesus whom we did not proclaim, or if you are receiving a Spirit different from the One you have already received or a Good News different from that which you have already welcomed, your toleration is admirable!
28995	47	11	5	 Why, I reckon myself in no respect inferior to those superlatively great Apostles.
28996	47	11	6	 And if in the matter of speech I am no orator, yet in knowledge I am not deficient. Nay, we have in every way made that  fully evident to you.
28997	47	11	7	 Is it a sin that I abased myself in order for you to be exalted, in that I proclaimed God's Good News to you without fee or reward?
28998	47	11	8	 Other Churches I robbed, receiving pay from them in order to do you service.
28999	47	11	9	 And when I was with you and my resources failed, there was no one to whom I became a burden--for the brethren when they came from Macedonia fully supplied my wants--and I kept myself from being in the least a burden to you, and will do so still.
29000	47	11	10	 Christ knows that it is true when I say that I will not be stopped from boasting of this anywhere in Greece.
29001	47	11	11	 And why? Because I do not love you? God knows that I do.
29002	47	11	12	 But I will persist in the same line of conduct in order to cut the ground from under the feet of those who desire an opportunity of getting themselves recognized as being on a level with us in the matters about which they boast.
29003	47	11	13	 For men of this stamp are sham apostles, dishonest workmen, assuming the garb of Apostles of Christ.
29004	47	11	14	 And no wonder.  Satan, their master, can disguise himself as an angel of light.
29005	47	11	15	 It is therefore no great thing for his servants also to disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will be in accordance with their actions.
29006	47	11	16	 To return to what I was saying. Let no one suppose that I am  foolish. Or if you must, at any rate make allowance for me as being foolish, in order that I, as well as they, may boast a little.
29007	47	11	17	 What I am now saying, I do not say by the Lord's command, but as a fool in his folly might, in this reckless boasting.
29008	47	11	18	 Since many boast for merely human reasons, I too will boast.
29009	47	11	19	 Wise as you yourselves are, you find pleasure in tolerating fools.
29010	47	11	20	 For you tolerate it, if any one enslaves you, lives at your expense, makes off with your property, gives himself airs, or  strikes you on the face.
29011	47	11	21	 I use the language of self-disparagement, as though I were admitting our own feebleness. Yet for whatever reason any one is `courageous' --I speak in mere folly--I also am courageous.
29012	47	11	22	 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.
29013	47	11	23	 Are they servants of Christ? (I speak as if I were out of my mind.) Much more am I His servant; serving Him more thoroughly than they by my labours, and more thoroughly also by my imprisonments, by excessively cruel floggings, and with risk of life many a time.
29014	47	11	24	 From the Jews I five times have received forty lashes all but one.
29015	47	11	25	 Three times I have been beaten with Roman rods, once I have been stoned, three times I have been shipwrecked, once for full four and twenty hours  I was floating on the open sea.
29016	47	11	26	 I have served Him by frequent travelling, amid dangers in crossing rivers, dangers from robbers; dangers from my own countrymen, dangers from the Gentiles; dangers in the city, dangers in the Desert, dangers by sea, dangers from spies in our midst;
29017	47	11	27	 with labour and toil, with many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, in frequent fastings, in cold, and with insufficient clothing.
29018	47	11	28	 And besides other things, which I pass over, there is that which presses on me daily--my anxiety for all the Churches.
29019	47	11	29	 Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is  led astray into sin, and I am not aflame with indignation?
29020	47	11	30	 If boast I must, it shall be of things which display my weakness.
29021	47	11	31	 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ--He who is blessed throughout the Ages--knows that I am speaking the truth.
29022	47	11	32	 In Damascus the governor under King Aretas kept guards at the gates of the city in order to apprehend me,
29023	47	11	33	 but through an  opening in the wall I was let down in a basket, and so escaped his hands.
29024	47	12	1	 I am compelled to boast. It is not a profitable employment, but I will proceed to  visions and revelations  granted me by the Lord.
29025	47	12	2	 I know a Christian man who fourteen years ago--  whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know; God knows--was caught up (this man of whom I am speaking) even to the highest Heaven.
29026	47	12	3	 And I know that this man--  whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know;
29027	47	12	4	 God knows--was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable things which no human being is permitted to repeat.
29028	47	12	5	 Of such a one I will boast; but of myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.
29029	47	12	6	 If however I  should choose to boast, I should not be a fool for so doing, for I should be speaking the truth. But I forbear, lest any one should be led to estimate me more highly than what his own eyes attest, or more highly than what he hears from my lips.
29030	47	12	7	 And  judging by the stupendous grandeur of the revelations--therefore lest I should be over-elated there has been sent to me, like the agony of impalement, Satan's angel dealing blow after blow, lest I should be over-elated.
29031	47	12	8	 As for this, three times have I besought the Lord to rid me of him;
29032	47	12	9	 but His reply has been, "My grace suffices for you, for  power matures in weakness." Most gladly therefore will I boast of my infirmities rather than complain of them--in order that Christ's power may overshadow me.
29033	47	12	10	 In fact I take pleasure in infirmities, in the bearing of insults, in distress, in persecutions, in grievous difficulties--for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong.
29034	47	12	11	 It is foolish of me to write all this, but you have compelled me to do so. Why, you ought to have been my vindicators; for in no respect have I been inferior to these superlatively great Apostles, even though in myself I am nothing.
29035	47	12	12	 The signs that characterize the true Apostle have been done among you, accompanied by unwearied fortitude, and by tokens and marvels and displays of power.
29036	47	12	13	 In what respect, therefore, have you been worse dealt with than other Churches, except that I myself never hung as  a dead weight upon you? Forgive the injustice I thus did you!
29037	47	12	14	 See, I am now for the third time prepared to visit you, but I will not be  a dead weight to you. I desire not your money, but yourselves; for children ought not to put by for their parents, but parents for their children.
29038	47	12	15	 And as for me, most gladly will I spend all I have and be utterly spent for your salvation.
29039	47	12	16	  If I love you  so intensely, am I the less to be loved? Be that as it may: I was not a burden to you. But  being by no means scrupulous, I entrapped you, they say!
29040	47	12	17	 Have I gained any selfish advantage over you through any one of the messengers I have sent to you?
29041	47	12	18	 I begged Titus to visit you, and sent our other brother with him. Did Titus gain any selfish advantage over you? Were not  he and I guided by one and the same Spirit, and did we not walk in the same steps?
29042	47	12	19	 You are imagining, all this time, that we are making our defense at your bar. In reality it is as in God's presence and in communion with Christ  that we speak; but, dear friends, it is all with a view to your progress in goodness.
29043	47	12	20	 For I am afraid that perhaps when I come I may not find you to be what I desire, and that you may find me to be what you do not desire; that perhaps there may be contention, jealousy, bitter feeling, party spirit, ill-natured talk, backbiting, undue eulogy, unrest;
29044	47	12	21	 and that upon re-visiting you I may be humbled by my God in your presence, and may have to mourn over many  whose hearts still cling to their old sins, and who have not repented of the impurity, fornication, and gross sensuality, of which they have been guilty.
29045	47	13	1	 This intended visit of mine is my third visit to you. <"On the evidence of two or three witnesses every charge shall be sustained.">
29046	47	13	2	 Those who cling to their old sins, and indeed all of you, I have forewarned and still forewarn (as I did on my second visit when present, so I do now, though absent) that, when I come again, I shall not spare you;
29047	47	13	3	 since you want a practical proof of the fact that Christ speaks by my lips--He who is not feeble towards you, but powerful among you.
29048	47	13	4	 For though it is true that He was crucified through weakness, yet He now lives through the power of God. We also are weak,  sharing His weakness, but with Him we shall be full of life to deal with you through the power of God.
29049	47	13	5	 Test yourselves to discover whether you are true believers: put your own selves under examination. Or do you not know that Jesus Christ is within you, unless you are insincere?
29050	47	13	6	 But I trust that you will recognize that we are not insincere.
29051	47	13	7	 And our prayer to God is that you may do nothing wrong; not in order that our sincerity may be demonstrated, but  that you may do what is right, even though our sincerity may seem to be doubtful.
29052	47	13	8	  For we have no power against the truth, but only for the furtherance of the truth;
29053	47	13	9	 and it is a joy to us when we are powerless, but you are strong. This we also pray for--the perfecting of your characters.
29054	47	13	10	 For this reason I write thus while absent, that when present I may not have to act severely in the exercise of the authority which the Lord has given me for building up, and not for pulling down.
29055	47	13	11	 Finally, brethren,  be joyful, secure perfection of character, take courage, be of one mind, live in peace. And then God who gives love and peace will be with you.
29056	47	13	12	 Salute one another with a holy kiss.
29057	47	13	13	 All God's people here send greetings to you.
29058	47	13	14	 May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and  the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.
29059	48	1	1	 Paul, an Apostle sent not from men nor by any man, but by Jesus Christ and by God the Father, who raised Jesus from among the dead--
29060	48	1	2	 and all the brethren who are with me: To the Churches of Galatia.
29061	48	1	3	 May grace and peace be granted to you from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,
29062	48	1	4	 who gave Himself to suffer for our sins in order to rescue us from the present wicked age in accordance with the will of our God and Father.
29063	48	1	5	 To Him be the glory to the Ages of the Ages! Amen.
29064	48	1	6	 I marvel that you are so readily leaving Him who called you by the grace of Christ, and are adhering to a different Good News.
29065	48	1	7	 For other "Good News" there is none; but there are some persons who are troubling you, and are seeking to distort the Good News concerning Christ.
29066	48	1	8	 But if even we or an angel from Heaven should bring you a Good News different from that which we have already brought you, let him be accursed.
29067	48	1	9	 What I have just said I repeat--if any one is preaching to you a Good News other than that which you originally received, let him be accursed.
29068	48	1	10	 For is it man's favour or God's that I aspire to? Or am I seeking to please men? If I were still a man-pleaser, I should not be Christ's bondservant.
29069	48	1	11	 For I must tell you, brethren, that the Good News which was proclaimed by me is not such as man approves of.
29070	48	1	12	 For, in fact, it was not from man that I received or learnt it, but by a revelation from Jesus Christ.
29071	48	1	13	 For you have heard of my early career in Judaism--how I furiously persecuted the Church of God, and made havoc of it;
29072	48	1	14	 and how in devotion to Judaism I outstripped many men of my own age among my people, being far more zealous than they on behalf of the traditions of my forefathers.
29073	48	1	15	 But when He who set me apart even from my birth, and called me by His grace,
29074	48	1	16	 saw fit to reveal His Son within me in order that I might tell among the Gentiles the Good News concerning Him, at once I did not confer with any human being,
29075	48	1	17	 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were my seniors in the Apostleship, but I went away into Arabia, and afterwards came back to Damascus.
29076	48	1	18	 Then, three years later, I went up to Jerusalem to inquire for  Peter, and I spent a fortnight with him.
29077	48	1	19	 I saw none of the other Apostles, except James, the Lord's brother.
29078	48	1	20	 In making these assertions I am speaking the truth, as in the sight of God.
29079	48	1	21	 Afterwards I visited Syria and Cilicia.
29080	48	1	22	 But to the Christian Churches in Judaea I was personally unknown.
29081	48	1	23	 They only heard it said, "He who was once our persecutor is now telling the Good News of the faith of which he formerly made havoc."
29082	48	1	24	 And they gave glory to God on my account.
29083	48	2	1	 Later still, after an interval of fourteen years, I again went up to Jerusalem in company with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.
29084	48	2	2	 I went up in obedience to a revelation of God's will; and I explained to them the Good News which I proclaim among the Gentiles. To the leaders of the Church this explanation was made in private, lest by any means I should be running, or should already have run, in vain.
29085	48	2	3	  But although my companion Titus was a Greek they did not insist upon even his being circumcised.
29086	48	2	4	 Yet there was danger of this through the false brethren secretly introduced into the Church, who had stolen in to spy out the  freedom which is ours in Christ Jesus, in order to rob us of it.
29087	48	2	5	 But not for an hour did we give way and submit to them; in order that the Good News might continue with you in its integrity.
29088	48	2	6	 From those leaders I gained nothing new. Whether they were men of importance or not, matters nothing to me--God recognizes no external distinctions. To me, at any rate, the leaders imparted nothing new.
29089	48	2	7	  Indeed, when they saw that I was entrusted with the preaching of the Good News to the Gentiles as Peter had been with that to the Jews--
29090	48	2	8	 for He who had been at work within Peter with a view to his Apostleship to the Jews had also been at work within me with a view to my Apostleship to the Gentiles--
29091	48	2	9	 and when they perceived the  mission which was graciously entrusted to me, they (that is to say, James,  Peter, and John, who were considered to be the pillars of the Church) welcomed Barnabas and me to their fellowship on the understanding that we were to go to the Gentiles and they to the Jews.
29092	48	2	10	 Only they urged that we should remember their poor--a thing which was uppermost in my own mind.
29093	48	2	11	 Now when  Peter visited Antioch, I remonstrated with him to his face, because he had incurred just censure.
29094	48	2	12	 For until certain persons came from James he had been accustomed to eat with Gentiles; but as soon as these persons came, he withdrew and separated himself for fear of the Circumcision party.
29095	48	2	13	 And along with him the other Jews also concealed their real opinions, so that even Barnabas was carried away by their lack of straightforwardness.
29096	48	2	14	 As soon as I saw that they were not walking uprightly in the spirit of the Good News, I said to  Peter, before them all, "If you, though you are a Jew, live as a Gentile does, and not as a Jew, how can you make the Gentiles follow Jewish customs?
29097	48	2	15	 You and I, though we are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners,
29098	48	2	16	 know that it is not through obedience to Law that a man can be declared free from guilt, but only through faith in Jesus Christ. We have therefore believed in Christ Jesus, for the purpose of being declared free from guilt, through faith in Christ and not through obedience to Law. For through obedience to Law no human being shall be declared free from guilt.
29099	48	2	17	 But if while we are seeking in Christ acquittal from guilt we ourselves are convicted of sin, Christ then encourages us to sin! No, indeed.
29100	48	2	18	 Why, if I am now rebuilding that structure of sin which I had demolished, I am thereby constituting myself a transgressor;
29101	48	2	19	 for it is by the Law that I have died to the Law, in order that I may live to God.
29102	48	2	20	 I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I that live, but Christ that lives in me; and the life which I now live in the body I live through faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself up to death on my behalf.
29103	48	2	21	 I do not nullify the grace of God; for if acquittal from guilt is obtainable through the Law, then Christ has died in vain."
29104	48	3	1	 You foolish Galatians! Whose sophistry has bewitched you--you to whom Jesus Christ has been vividly portrayed  as on the Cross?
29105	48	3	2	 Answer me this one question, "Is it on the ground of your obedience to the Law that you received the Spirit, or is it because, when you heard, you believed?"
29106	48	3	3	 Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now going to reach perfection through what is external?
29107	48	3	4	 Have you  endured such sufferings to no purpose--if indeed it has been to no purpose?
29108	48	3	5	 He who gives you His Spirit and works miracles among you--does He do so on the ground of your obedience to the Law, or is it the result of your having heard and believed:
29109	48	3	6	 even as <Abraham believed God, and his faith was placed to his account as righteousness?>
29110	48	3	7	 Notice therefore that those who possess faith are true sons of Abraham.
29111	48	3	8	 And the Scripture, foreseeing that in consequence of faith God would declare the nations to be free from guilt, sent beforehand the Good News to Abraham, saying, <"In you all the nations shall be blessed.">
29112	48	3	9	 So we see that it is those who possess faith that are blessed with believing Abraham.
29113	48	3	10	 All who are depending upon their own obedience to the Law are under a curse, for it is written, <"Cursed is every one who does not remain faithful to all the precepts of the Law, and practise them.">
29114	48	3	11	 It is evident, too, that no one can find acceptance with God simply by obeying the Law, because <"the righteous shall live by faith,">
29115	48	3	12	 and the Law has nothing to do with faith. It teaches that <"he who does these things shall live by doing them.">
29116	48	3	13	 Christ has purchased our freedom from the curse of the Law by becoming accursed for us--because <"Cursed is every one who is hanged upon a tree.">
29117	48	3	14	 Our freedom has been thus purchased in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing belonging to Abraham may come upon the nations, so that through faith we may receive the promised Spirit.
29118	48	3	15	 Brethren, even a covenant made by a man--to borrow an illustration from daily life--when once formally sanctioned is not liable to be set aside or added to.
29119	48	3	16	 (Now the promises were given to Abraham and to his seed. God did not say "and to seeds," as if speaking of many, but "and to your seed," since He spoke of only one--and this is Christ.)
29120	48	3	17	 I mean that the Covenant which God had already formally made is not abrogated by the Law which was given four hundred and thirty years later--so as to annul the promise.
29121	48	3	18	 For if the inheritance comes through obedience to Law, it no longer comes because of a promise. But, as a matter of fact, God has granted it to Abraham in fulfilment of a promise.
29122	48	3	19	 Why then was the Law given? It was imposed later on for the sake of  defining sin, until the seed should come to whom God had made the promise; and its details were laid down by a mediator with the help of angels.
29123	48	3	20	 But there cannot be a mediator where only one individual is concerned.
29124	48	3	21	  God, however, is only one. Is the Law then opposed to the promises of God? No, indeed; for if a Law had been given which could have conferred Life, righteousness would certainly have come by the Law.
29125	48	3	22	 But Scripture has shown that all mankind are the prisoners of sin, in order that the promised blessing, which depends on faith in Jesus Christ, may be given to those who believe.
29126	48	3	23	 Before this faith came, we Jews were perpetual prisoners under the Law, living under restraints and limitations in preparation for the faith which was soon to be revealed.
29127	48	3	24	 So that the Law has acted the part of a tutor-slave  to lead us to Christ, in order that through faith we may be declared to be free from guilt.
29128	48	3	25	 But now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor-slave.
29129	48	3	26	 You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus;
29130	48	3	27	 for all of you who have been baptized  into Christ, have clothed yourselves with Christ.
29131	48	3	28	  In Him the distinctions between Jew and Gentile, slave and free man, male and female, disappear; you are all one in Christ Jesus.
29132	48	3	29	 And if you belong to Christ, then you are indeed true descendants of Abraham, and are heirs in fulfilment of the promise.
29133	48	4	1	 Now I say that so long as  an heir is a child, he in no respect differs from a slave, although he is the owner of everything,
29134	48	4	2	 but he is under the control of guardians and trustees until the time his father has appointed.
29135	48	4	3	 So we also, when spiritually we were children, were subject to the world's rudimentary notions, and were enslaved.
29136	48	4	4	 But, when the time was fully come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born subject to Law,
29137	48	4	5	 in order to purchase the freedom of all who were subject to Law, so that we might receive recognition as sons.
29138	48	4	6	 And because you are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of His Son to enter your hearts and cry "Abba! our Father!"
29139	48	4	7	 Therefore you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir also through God's own act.
29140	48	4	8	 But at one time, you Gentiles, having no knowledge of God, were slaves to gods which in reality do not exist.
29141	48	4	9	 Now, however, having come to know God--or rather to be known by Him--how is it you are again turning back to weak and worthless rudimentary notions to which you are once more willing to be enslaved?
29142	48	4	10	 You scrupulously observe days and months, special seasons, and years.
29143	48	4	11	 I am alarmed about you, and am afraid that I have perhaps bestowed labour upon you to no purpose.
29144	48	4	12	 Brethren, become as I am, I beseech you; for I have also become like you. In no respect did you behave badly to me.
29145	48	4	13	 And you know that in those early days it was on account of  bodily infirmity that I proclaimed the Good News to you,
29146	48	4	14	 and yet the bodily infirmity which was such a trial to you, you did not regard with contempt or loathing, but you received me as if I had been an angel of God or Christ Jesus Himself!
29147	48	4	15	 I ask you, then, what has become of your  self-congratulations? For I bear you witness that had it been possible you would have torn out your own eyes and have given them to me.
29148	48	4	16	 Can it be that I have become your enemy through speaking the truth to you?
29149	48	4	17	 These men pay court to you, but not with honourable motives. They want to exclude you, so that you may pay court to them.
29150	48	4	18	 It is always an honourable thing to be courted in an honourable cause; always, and not only when I am with you, my children--
29151	48	4	19	 you for whom I am again, as it were, undergoing the pains of childbirth, until Christ is fully formed within you.
29152	48	4	20	 Would that I were with you and could  change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.
29153	48	4	21	 Tell me--you who want to continue to be subject to Law--will you not listen to the Law?
29154	48	4	22	 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave-girl and one by the free woman.
29155	48	4	23	 But we see that the child of the slave-girl was born in the common course of nature; but the child of the free woman in fulfilment of the promise.
29156	48	4	24	 All this is allegorical; for the women represent two Covenants. One has its origin on Mount Sinai, and bears children destined for slavery.
29157	48	4	25	 This is Hagar;  for the name Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, which is in bondage together with her children.
29158	48	4	26	 But the Jerusalem which is above is free, and *she* is *our* mother.
29159	48	4	27	 For it is written, <"Rejoice, thou  barren woman that bearest not, break forth into a joyful cry, thou that dost not travail with child. For the desolate woman has many children--more indeed than she who has the husband.">
29160	48	4	28	 But you, brethren, like Isaac, are children born in fulfilment of a promise.
29161	48	4	29	 Yet just as, at that time, the child born in the common course of nature persecuted the one whose birth was due to the power of the Spirit, so it is now.
29162	48	4	30	 But what says the Scripture? <"Send away the slave-girl and her son, for never shall the slave-girl's son share the inheritance with the son of the free woman.">
29163	48	4	31	 Therefore, brethren, since we are not the children of a slave-girl, but of the free woman--
29164	48	5	1	 Christ having made us gloriously free--stand fast and do not again be hampered with the yoke of slavery.
29165	48	5	2	 Remember that it is I Paul who tell you that if you receive circumcision Christ will avail you nothing.
29166	48	5	3	 I once more protest to every man who receives circumcision that he is under obligation to obey the whole Law of Moses.
29167	48	5	4	  Christ has become nothing to any of you who are seeking acceptance with God through the Law: you have fallen away from grace.
29168	48	5	5	 *We* have not, for through the Spirit we wait with longing hope for an  acceptance with God which is to come through faith.
29169	48	5	6	 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any importance; but only faith working through love.
29170	48	5	7	 You were running the race nobly! Who has interfered and caused you to swerve from the truth?
29171	48	5	8	  No such teaching ever proceeded from Him who is calling you.
29172	48	5	9	 A little  yeast  corrupts the whole of the dough.
29173	48	5	10	 For my part I have  strong confidence in you in the Lord that you will adopt my view of the matter. But the man--be he who he may--who is troubling you, will have to bear the full weight of the judgement to be pronounced on him.
29174	48	5	11	 As for me, brethren, if I am still a preacher of circumcision, how is it that I am still suffering persecution? In that case the Cross has ceased to be a stumbling-block!
29175	48	5	12	 Would to God that those who are unsettling your faith would even  mutilate themselves.
29176	48	5	13	 You  however, brethren, were called to  freedom. Only do not turn your freedom into an excuse for giving way to your lower natures; but become bondservants to one another in a spirit of love.
29177	48	5	14	 For the entire Law has been obeyed when you have kept the single precept, which says, <"You are to love your  fellow man equally with yourself.">
29178	48	5	15	 But if you are perpetually snarling and snapping at one another, beware lest you are destroyed by one another.
29179	48	5	16	 This then is what I mean. Let your lives be guided by the Spirit, and then you will certainly not  indulge the cravings of  your lower natures.
29180	48	5	17	 For the cravings of the lower nature are opposed to those of the Spirit, and the cravings of the Spirit are opposed to those of the lower nature; because these are antagonistic to each other, so that you cannot do everything to which you are inclined.
29181	48	5	18	 But if  the Spirit is leading you, you are not subject to Law.
29182	48	5	19	 Now you know full well the doings of our lower natures. Fornication, impurity, indecency, idol-worship, sorcery;
29183	48	5	20	 enmity, strife, jealousy, outbursts of passion, intrigues, dissensions, factions,  envyings;
29184	48	5	21	 hard drinking, riotous feasting, and the like. And as to these I forewarn you, as I have already forewarned you, that those who are guilty of such things will have no share in the Kingdom of God.
29185	48	5	22	 The Spirit, on the other hand, brings a harvest of love, joy, peace; patience towards others, kindness, benevolence;
29186	48	5	23	 good faith, meekness, self-restraint.
29187	48	5	24	 Against such things as these there is no law. Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified their lower nature with its passions and appetites.
29188	48	5	25	 If we are living by the Spirit's power, let our conduct also be governed by the Spirit's power.
29189	48	5	26	 Let us not become vain-glorious, challenging one another, envying one another.
29190	48	6	1	 Brethren, if anybody be detected in any misconduct, you who are spiritual should restore such a one in a spirit of meekness. And let each of you keep watch over himself, lest  he also fall into temptation.
29191	48	6	2	 Always carry one another's burdens, and so  obey the whole of Christ's Law.
29192	48	6	3	 For if there is any one who thinks himself to be somebody when he is nobody, he is deluding himself.
29193	48	6	4	 But let every man scrutinize his own conduct, and then he will find out, not with reference to another but with reference to himself, what he has to boast of.
29194	48	6	5	 For every man will have to carry his own load.
29195	48	6	6	 But let those who receive instruction in Christian truth share with their instructors all temporal blessings.
29196	48	6	7	 Do not deceive yourselves. God is not to be scoffed at. For whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.
29197	48	6	8	 He who sows in the field of his lower nature, will from that nature reap  destruction; but he who sows to serve the Spirit will from the Spirit reap the Life of the Ages.
29198	48	6	9	 Let us not abate our courage in doing what is right; for in due time we shall reap a reward, if we do not faint.
29199	48	6	10	 So then,  as we have opportunity, let us labour for the good of all, and especially of those who belong  to the household of the faith.
29200	48	6	11	 See in what large letters  I am writing to you with my own hand.
29201	48	6	12	 All who desire to display their zeal for external observances try to compel you to receive circumcision, but their real object is simply to escape being persecuted for the Cross of Christ.
29202	48	6	13	 For these very men do not really keep the Law of Moses, but they would have you receive circumcision in order that they may glory in *your* bodies.
29203	48	6	14	 But as for me, God forbid that I should glory in anything except the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,  upon which the world  is crucified to me, and I am crucified to the world.
29204	48	6	15	  For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any importance; but only a renewed nature.
29205	48	6	16	 And all who  shall regulate their lives by this principle--may peace and mercy be given to them--and to the true Israel of God.
29206	48	6	17	 From this time onward let no one trouble me; for, as for me, I bear, branded on my body,  the scars of Jesus as my Master.
29207	48	6	18	 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirits, brethren. Amen.
29208	49	1	1	 Paul, an Apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God: To God's people who are in Ephesus--believers in Christ Jesus.
29209	49	1	2	 May grace and peace be granted to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
29210	49	1	3	 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has crowned us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms in Christ;
29211	49	1	4	 even as, in His love,  He chose us as His own in Christ before the creation of the world, that we might be holy and without blemish in His presence.
29212	49	1	5	 For He pre-destined us to be adopted by Himself as sons through Jesus Christ--such being His gracious will and pleasure--
29213	49	1	6	 to the praise of the splendour of His grace with which He has  enriched us in the beloved One.
29214	49	1	7	 It is in Him, and through the shedding of His blood, that we have our  deliverance--the forgiveness of our offences--so abundant was God's grace,
29215	49	1	8	 the grace which He, the possessor of all wisdom and understanding, lavished upon us,
29216	49	1	9	 when He made known to us the secret of His will. And this is in harmony with God's merciful purpose
29217	49	1	10	 for the government of the world when the times are ripe for it--the purpose which He has cherished in His own mind  of restoring the whole creation to find its one Head in Christ; yes, things in Heaven and things on earth, to find their one Head in Him.
29218	49	1	11	 In Him we Jews have been made heirs, having been chosen beforehand in accordance with the intention of Him whose might carries out in everything the design of His own will,
29219	49	1	12	 so that we should be devoted to the extolling of His glorious attributes--we who were the first to fix our hopes on Christ.
29220	49	1	13	 And in Him you Gentiles also, after listening to the Message of the truth, the Good News of your salvation--having believed in Him--were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit;
29221	49	1	14	 that Spirit being a pledge and foretaste of our inheritance, in anticipation of its full redemption--the inheritance which He has purchased  to be specially His for the extolling of His glory.
29222	49	1	15	 For this reason I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which prevails among you, and  of your love for all God's people,
29223	49	1	16	 offer never ceasing thanks on your behalf while I make mention of you in my prayers.
29224	49	1	17	 For I always beseech the God of our Lord Jesus Christ--the Father  most glorious--to give you  a spirit of wisdom and penetration through an intimate knowledge of Him,
29225	49	1	18	 the eyes of your  understanding being enlightened so that you may know what is the hope which His call to you inspires, what the wealth of the glory of His inheritance in God's people,
29226	49	1	19	 and what the transcendent greatness of His power  in us believers as seen in the working of His infinite might
29227	49	1	20	 when He displayed it in Christ by raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His own right hand in the heavenly realms,
29228	49	1	21	  high above all other government and authority and power and dominion, and every title of sovereignty used either in this Age or in the Age to come.
29229	49	1	22	 God has put all things under His feet, and has appointed Him universal and supreme Head of the Church, which is His Body,
29230	49	1	23	  the completeness of Him who everywhere fills the universe with Himself.
29231	49	2	1	 To you Gentiles also, who were dead through your offences and sins,
29232	49	2	2	 which were once habitual to you while you walked in the ways of this world and obeyed the Prince of the  powers of the air, the spirits that are now at work in the hearts of the sons of disobedience--to you God has given Life.
29233	49	2	3	 Among them all of us also formerly passed our lives, governed by the inclinations of our  lower natures, indulging the cravings of those  natures and of our own thoughts, and were in our original state  deserving of anger like all others.
29234	49	2	4	 But God, being rich in mercy, because of the intense love which He bestowed on us,
29235	49	2	5	 caused us, dead though we were through our offences, to live with Christ--it is by grace that  you have been saved--
29236	49	2	6	 raised us with Him from the dead, and enthroned us with Him in the heavenly realms as being in Christ Jesus,
29237	49	2	7	 in order that, by His goodness to us in Christ Jesus, He might display in the Ages to come the transcendent riches of His grace.
29238	49	2	8	 For it is by grace that  you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves. It is God's gift, and is not on the ground of merit--
29239	49	2	9	 so that it may be impossible for any one to boast.
29240	49	2	10	 For we are God's own handiwork, created in Christ Jesus for good works which He has  pre-destined us to practise.
29241	49	2	11	 Therefore, do not forget that formerly you were Gentiles as to your bodily condition. You were called the Uncircumcision by those who style themselves the Circumcised--their circumcision being one which the knife has effected.
29242	49	2	12	 At that time you were living apart from Christ, estranged from the Commonwealth of Israel, with no share by birth in the Covenants which are based on the Promises, and you had no hope and no God, in all the world.
29243	49	2	13	 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were so far away have been brought near through the death of Christ.
29244	49	2	14	 For He is our peace--He who has made  Jews and Gentiles one, and in His own human nature has broken down the hostile dividing wall,
29245	49	2	15	 by setting aside the Law with its commandments, expressed, as they were, in definite decrees. His design was to unite the two sections of humanity in Himself so as to form one new man,
29246	49	2	16	 thus effecting peace, and to reconcile Jews and Gentiles in one body to God, by means of His cross--slaying by it their mutual enmity.
29247	49	2	17	 So He came and proclaimed good news of peace to you who were so far away, and peace to those who were near;
29248	49	2	18	 because it is through Him that Jews and Gentiles alike have  access through one Spirit to the Father.
29249	49	2	19	 You are therefore no longer mere foreigners or persons excluded from civil rights. On the contrary you share citizenship with God's people and are members of His family.
29250	49	2	20	 You are a building which has been reared on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, the cornerstone being Christ Jesus Himself,
29251	49	2	21	 in union with whom  the whole fabric, fitted and closely joined together, is growing so as to form a holy sanctuary in the Lord;
29252	49	2	22	 in whom you also are being built up together to become a fixed abode for God through the Spirit.
29253	49	3	1	  For this reason I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles--
29254	49	3	2	 if, that is, you have heard of the  work which God has graciously entrusted to me for your benefit,
29255	49	3	3	 and that by a revelation the truth hitherto kept secret was made known to me as I have already briefly explained it to you.
29256	49	3	4	 By means of that explanation, as you read it, you can judge of my insight into the truth of Christ
29257	49	3	5	 which in earlier ages was not made known to the human race, as it has now been revealed to His holy Apostles and Prophets through the Spirit--
29258	49	3	6	 I mean the truth that the Gentiles are joint heirs with us Jews, and that they form one body with us, and have the same interest as we have in the promise which has been made good in Christ Jesus through the Good News,
29259	49	3	7	 in which I have been appointed to serve, in virtue of the work which God, in the exercise of His power within me, has graciously entrusted to me.
29260	49	3	8	 To me who am  less than the least of all God's people has this work been graciously entrusted--to proclaim to the Gentiles the Good News of the  exhaustless wealth of Christ,
29261	49	3	9	 and to show  all men in a clear light what my stewardship is. It is the stewardship of the truth which from all the Ages lay concealed in the mind of God, the Creator of all things--
29262	49	3	10	 concealed in order that the Church might now be used to display to the powers and authorities in the heavenly realms the innumerable aspects of God's wisdom.
29263	49	3	11	 Such was the  eternal purpose which He had formed in Christ Jesus our Lord,
29264	49	3	12	 in whom we have this bold and confident access through our faith in Him.
29265	49	3	13	 Therefore I entreat you not to lose heart in the midst of my sufferings on your behalf, for they bring you honour.
29266	49	3	14	 For this reason, on bended knee I beseech the Father,
29267	49	3	15	 from whom  the whole family in Heaven and on earth derives its name,
29268	49	3	16	 to grant you--in accordance with the wealth of His glorious perfections--to be strengthened by His Spirit with power penetrating to your inmost being.
29269	49	3	17	 I pray that Christ may make His home in your hearts through your faith; so that having your roots deep and your foundations strong, in love, you may become mighty to grasp the idea,
29270	49	3	18	 as it is grasped by all God's people, of the breadth and length, the height and depth--
29271	49	3	19	 yes, to attain to a knowledge of the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, so that you may be made complete in accordance with God's own standard of completeness.
29272	49	3	20	 Now to Him who, in exercise of His power that is at work within us, is able to do infinitely beyond all our highest prayers or thoughts--
29273	49	3	21	 to Him be the glory in the Church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, world without end! Amen.
29274	49	4	1	 I, then, the prisoner for the Master's sake, entreat you to live and act as becomes those who have received the call that you have received--
29275	49	4	2	 with all lowliness of mind and unselfishness, and with patience, bearing with one another lovingly, and earnestly striving to maintain,
29276	49	4	3	 in the uniting bond of peace, the unity given by the Spirit.
29277	49	4	4	 There is but one body and but one Spirit, as also when you were called you had one and the same hope held out to you.
29278	49	4	5	 There is but one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
29279	49	4	6	 and one God and Father of all, who rules over all, acts through all, and dwells in all.
29280	49	4	7	 Yet to each of us individually  grace was given, measured out with the munificence of Christ.
29281	49	4	8	 For this reason Scripture says: <"He  re-ascended on high, He led captive  a host of captives,  and gave gifts to men.">
29282	49	4	9	 (Now this "re-ascended" --what does it mean but that He had first descended into  the lower regions of the earth?
29283	49	4	10	 He who descended is the same as He who ascended again far above all the Heavens in order  to fill the universe.)
29284	49	4	11	 And He Himself appointed some to be Apostles, some to be Prophets, some to be evangelists, some to be pastors and teachers,
29285	49	4	12	 in order fully to equip His people for the work of serving--for the building up of Christ's body--
29286	49	4	13	  till we all of us arrive at oneness in faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, and at mature manhood and the stature of full-grown men in Christ.
29287	49	4	14	 So we shall no longer be babes nor shall we resemble mariners tossed on the waves and carried about with every changing wind of doctrine according to men's cleverness and unscrupulous cunning, making use of every shifting device to mislead.
29288	49	4	15	 But we shall lovingly hold to the truth, and shall in all respects grow up into union with Him who is our Head, even Christ.
29289	49	4	16	 Dependent on Him, the whole body--its various parts closely fitting and firmly adhering to one another--  grows by the aid of every  contributory link, with power proportioned to the need of each individual part, so as to build itself up in a spirit of love.
29290	49	4	17	 Therefore I  warn you, and I implore you in the name of the Master, no longer to live as the Gentiles in their perverseness live,
29291	49	4	18	 with darkened understandings, having by reason of the ignorance which is deep-seated in them and the insensibility of their moral nature, no share in the Life which God gives.
29292	49	4	19	 Such men being past feeling  have abandoned themselves to impurity, greedily indulging in every kind of profligacy.
29293	49	4	20	 But these are not the lessons which you have learned from Christ;
29294	49	4	21	 if at least you have heard His voice and in Him have been taught--and this is true Christian teaching--
29295	49	4	22	 to put away, in regard to your former mode of life, your original evil nature which  is doomed to perish as befits its misleading impulses,
29296	49	4	23	 and to get yourselves renewed in the temper of your minds and clothe yourselves
29297	49	4	24	 with that new and better self which has been created to resemble God in the righteousness and holiness which come from the truth.
29298	49	4	25	 For this reason, laying aside falsehood, every one of you should speak the truth to his fellow man; for we are, as it were, parts of one another.
29299	49	4	26	 If angry, beware of sinning. Let not your irritation last until the sun goes down;
29300	49	4	27	 and do not leave room for the Devil.
29301	49	4	28	 He who has been a thief must steal no more, but, instead of that, should work with his  own hands in honest industry, so that he may have something of which he can give the needy a share.
29302	49	4	29	 Let no unwholesome words ever pass your lips, but let all your words be good for benefiting others according to the need of the moment, so that they may be a means of blessing to the hearers.
29303	49	4	30	 And beware of grieving the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you have been sealed in preparation for the day of Redemption.
29304	49	4	31	 Let all bitterness and all passionate feeling, all anger and loud insulting language, be unknown among you--and also every kind of malice.
29305	49	4	32	 On the contrary learn to be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, just as God in Christ  has also forgiven you.
29306	49	5	1	 Therefore be imitators of God, as His dear children.
29307	49	5	2	 And live and act lovingly, as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up to death on our behalf as an offering and sacrifice to God, yielding a fragrant odor.
29308	49	5	3	 But fornication and every kind of impurity, or covetousness, let them not even be mentioned among you, for they  ought not to be named among God's people.
29309	49	5	4	 Avoid shameful and foolish talk and low jesting--they are all alike discreditable--and in place of these give thanks.
29310	49	5	5	 For be well assured that no fornicator or immoral person and no money-grubber--or in other words idol-worshipper--has any share awaiting him in the Kingdom of Christ and of God.
29311	49	5	6	 Let no one deceive you with empty words, for it is on account of these very sins that God's anger is coming upon the  disobedient.
29312	49	5	7	 Therefore do not become sharers with them.
29313	49	5	8	 There was a time when you were nothing but darkness. Now, as Christians, you are Light itself.
29314	49	5	9	 Live and act as sons of Light--for the effect of the Light is seen in every kind of goodness, uprightness and truth--
29315	49	5	10	 and learn in your own experiences what is fully pleasing to the Lord.
29316	49	5	11	 Have nothing to do with the barren unprofitable deeds of darkness, but, instead of that,  set your faces against them;
29317	49	5	12	 for the things which are done by these people in secret it is disgraceful even to speak of.
29318	49	5	13	 But everything can be tested by the light and thus be shown in its true colors; for whatever shines of itself is light.
29319	49	5	14	 For this reason it is said, "Rise, sleeper; rise from among the dead, and Christ will shed light upon you."
29320	49	5	15	 Therefore be very careful how you live and act. Let it not be as unwise men, but as wise.
29321	49	5	16	 Buy up your opportunities, for these are evil times.
29322	49	5	17	 On this account do not prove yourselves wanting in sense, but try to understand what the Lord's will is.
29323	49	5	18	 Do not over-indulge in wine--a thing in which excess is so easy--
29324	49	5	19	 but  drink deeply of God's Spirit. Speak to one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and offer praise in your hearts to the Lord.
29325	49	5	20	 Always and for everything let your thanks to God the Father be presented in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
29326	49	5	21	 and submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
29327	49	5	22	 Married women, submit to your own husbands as if to the Lord;
29328	49	5	23	 because a husband is the Head of his wife as Christ also is the Head of the Church, being indeed the Saviour of this His Body.
29329	49	5	24	 And just as the Church submits to Christ, so also married women should be entirely submissive to their husbands.
29330	49	5	25	 Married men, love your wives, as Christ also loved the Church and gave Himself up to death for her;
29331	49	5	26	 in order to make her holy, cleansing her with  the baptismal water by the word,
29332	49	5	27	 that He might present the Church to Himself a glorious bride, without spot or wrinkle or any other defect, but to be holy and unblemished.
29333	49	5	28	 So too married men ought to love their wives as much as they love themselves. He who loves his wife loves himself.
29334	49	5	29	 For never yet has a man hated his own body. On the contrary he feeds and cherishes it, just as Christ feeds and cherishes the Church;
29335	49	5	30	 because we are, as it were, parts of His Body.
29336	49	5	31	 <"For this reason a man is to leave his father and his mother and be united to his wife, and the two shall be as one.">
29337	49	5	32	 That is a great truth hitherto kept secret: I mean the truth concerning Christ and the Church.
29338	49	5	33	 Yet I insist that among you also, each man is to love his own wife as much as he loves himself, and let a married woman see to it that she treats her husband with respect.
29339	49	6	1	 Children,  be obedient to your parents as a Christian duty, for it is a duty.
29340	49	6	2	 <"Honour your father and your mother"> --this is the first Commandment which has a promise added to it--
29341	49	6	3	 <"so that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth.">
29342	49	6	4	 And you, fathers, do not  irritate your children, but bring them up tenderly with true Christian training and advice.
29343	49	6	5	 Slaves,  be obedient to your earthly masters, with respect and eager anxiety to please and with simplicity of motive as if you were obeying Christ.
29344	49	6	6	 Let it not be in acts of eye-service as if you had but to please men, but as Christ's bondservants who are doing God's will from the heart.
29345	49	6	7	 With right good will, be faithful to your duty as service rendered to the Lord and not to man.
29346	49	6	8	 You well know that whatever right thing any one does, he will receive a requital for it from the Lord, whether he is a slave or a free man.
29347	49	6	9	 And you masters, act towards your slaves on the same principles, and refrain from threats. For you know that in Heaven there is One who is your Master as well as theirs, and that  merely earthly distinctions there are none with Him.
29348	49	6	10	 In conclusion, strengthen yourselves in the Lord and in the power which His supreme might imparts.
29349	49	6	11	 Put on the complete armour of God, so as to be able to stand firm against all the stratagems of the Devil.
29350	49	6	12	 For ours is not a conflict with mere flesh and blood, but with the despotisms, the empires, the forces that control and govern this dark world--the spiritual hosts of evil arrayed against us in the heavenly warfare.
29351	49	6	13	 Therefore put on the complete armour of God, so that you may be able to stand your ground on  the day of battle, and, having fought to the end, to remain victors on the field.
29352	49	6	14	 Stand therefore, first fastening round you the girdle of truth and putting on the breastplate of uprightness
29353	49	6	15	 as well as the shoes of the Good News of peace--  a firm foundation for your feet.
29354	49	6	16	 And  besides all these take the great shield of faith, on which you will be able to quench all the flaming darts of the Wicked one;
29355	49	6	17	 and  take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God.
29356	49	6	18	 Pray with  unceasing prayer and entreaty on every fitting occasion in the Spirit, and be always on the alert to seize opportunities for doing so, with  unwearied persistence and entreaty on behalf of all God's people,
29357	49	6	19	 and ask on my behalf that words may be given to me so that, outspoken and fearless, I may make known the truths (hitherto kept secret) of the Good News--
29358	49	6	20	 to spread which I am an ambassador in chains--so that when telling them I may speak out boldly as I ought.
29359	49	6	21	 But in order that you also may know how I am doing, Tychicus our dearly-loved brother and faithful helper in the Lord's service will tell you everything.
29360	49	6	22	 I have sent him to you for the very purpose--that you may know about us and that he may encourage you.
29361	49	6	23	 Peace be to the brethren, and love combined with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
29362	49	6	24	 May grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with perfect sincerity.
29363	50	1	1	 Paul and Timothy, bondservants of Christ Jesus: To all God's people in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with  the ministers of the Church and their assistants.
29364	50	1	2	  May grace and peace be granted to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
29365	50	1	3	 I thank my God at  my every remembrance of you--
29366	50	1	4	 always when offering any prayer on behalf of you all, finding a joy in offering it.
29367	50	1	5	 I thank my God, I say, for your cooperation in spreading the Good News, from the time it first came to you even until now.
29368	50	1	6	 For of this I am confident, that He who has begun a good work within you will go on to perfect it in preparation for the day of Jesus Christ.
29369	50	1	7	 And I am justified in having this confidence about you all, because, both during my imprisonment and when I stand up in  defence of the Good News or to confirm its truth, I have you in my heart, sharers as you all are in the same grace as myself.
29370	50	1	8	 For God is my witness how I yearn over all of you with tender Christian affection.
29371	50	1	9	 And it is my prayer that your love may be more and more accompanied by clear knowledge and keen perception, for  testing things that differ,
29372	50	1	10	 so that you may be men of transparent character, and may be blameless, in preparation for the day of Christ,
29373	50	1	11	 being filled with these fruits of righteousness which come through Jesus Christ--  to the glory and praise of God.
29374	50	1	12	 Now I would have you know, brethren, that what I have gone through has turned out to the furtherance of the Good News rather than otherwise.
29375	50	1	13	 And thus it has become notorious among all the Imperial Guards, and everywhere, that it is  for the sake of Christ that I am a prisoner;
29376	50	1	14	 and the greater part of the brethren, made confident in the Lord  through my imprisonment, now speak of God's Message without fear, more boldly than ever.
29377	50	1	15	 Some indeed actually preach Christ out of envy and contentiousness but there are also others who do it from good will.
29378	50	1	16	 These latter preach Him from love to me, knowing that I am here for the defence of the Good News;
29379	50	1	17	 while  the others proclaim Him from motives of rivalry, and insincerely, supposing that by this they are embittering my imprisonment.
29380	50	1	18	 What does it matter, however? In any case Christ is preached--either perversely or in honest truth; and in that I rejoice, yes,  and will rejoice.
29381	50	1	19	 For I know that it will result in my  salvation through your prayers and a bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
29382	50	1	20	 in fulfilment of my  eager expectation and hope that I shall never have reason to feel ashamed, but that by my perfect freedom of speech Christ will be glorified in me, now as always, either by my life or by my death.
29383	50	1	21	 For, with me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.
29384	50	1	22	  But since to live means a longer stay on earth, that implies more labour for me--and not unsuccessful labour; and which I am to choose I cannot tell.
29385	50	1	23	 I am in a dilemma, my earnest desire being to depart and be with Christ, for that is far, far better.
29386	50	1	24	 But for your sakes it is more important that I should still remain in the body.
29387	50	1	25	 I am convinced of this, and I know that I shall remain, and shall go on working side by side with you all, to promote your progress and joy in the faith;
29388	50	1	26	 so that, as Christians, you may have additional reason for glorying about me as the result of my being with you again.
29389	50	1	27	 Only let the lives you live be worthy of the Good News of the Christ, in order that, whether I come and see you or, being absent, only hear of you, I may know that you are standing fast in one spirit and with one mind, fighting shoulder to shoulder  for the faith of the Good News.
29390	50	1	28	 Never for a moment quail before your antagonists. Your fearlessness will be to them a sure token of impending destruction, but to you it will be a sure token of your salvation--a token coming from God.
29391	50	1	29	 For you have had the privilege granted you on behalf of Christ--not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer on His behalf;
29392	50	1	30	 maintaining, as you do, the same kind of conflict that  you once saw in me and which you still hear  that I am engaged in.
29393	50	2	1	  If then I can appeal to you as the followers of Christ, if there is any persuasive power in love and any common sharing of the Spirit, or if you have any tender-heartedness and compassion, make my joy complete by being of one mind,
29394	50	2	2	 united by mutual love, with harmony of feeling giving your minds to one and the same object.
29395	50	2	3	 Do nothing in a spirit of factiousness or of vainglory, but, with true humility, let every one regard the rest as being of more account than himself;
29396	50	2	4	 each fixing his attention, not simply on his own  interests, but on those of others also.
29397	50	2	5	 Let the same disposition be in you which was in Christ Jesus.
29398	50	2	6	  Although from the beginning He  had the nature of God He did not reckon His equality with God a treasure to be tightly grasped.
29399	50	2	7	 Nay,  He stripped Himself of His glory, and took on Him the nature of  a bondservant by becoming a man like other men.
29400	50	2	8	 And  being recognized as truly human, He humbled Himself and even stooped to die; yes, to die on a cross.
29401	50	2	9	 It is in consequence of this that God has also so highly exalted Him, and has conferred on Him the Name which is supreme above every other,
29402	50	2	10	 in order that in the Name of JESUS every knee should bow, of beings in Heaven, of those on the earth, and of those in the underworld,
29403	50	2	11	 and that every tongue should confess that JESUS CHRIST is LORD, to the glory of God the Father.
29404	50	2	12	 Therefore, my dearly-loved friends, as I have always found you obedient, labour earnestly with fear and trembling--not merely as though I were present with you, but much more now since I am absent from you--labour earnestly, I say, to make sure of your own salvation.
29405	50	2	13	 For it is God Himself whose power creates within you the desire to do His gracious will and also brings about the accomplishment of the desire.
29406	50	2	14	 Be ever on your guard against a grudging and contentious spirit,
29407	50	2	15	 so that you may always prove yourselves to be blameless and spotless--irreproachable children of God in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you are seen as heavenly lights  in the world,
29408	50	2	16	  holding out to them a Message of Life. It will then be my glory on the day of Christ that I did not run my race in vain nor toil in vain.
29409	50	2	17	 Nay, even if my life is to be poured as a libation upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I rejoice, and I congratulate you all.
29410	50	2	18	 And I bid you also share my gladness, and congratulate me.
29411	50	2	19	 But, if the Lord permits it, I hope before long to send Timothy to you, that I, in turn, may be cheered by getting news of you.
29412	50	2	20	 For I have no one likeminded with him, who will cherish a genuine care for you.
29413	50	2	21	 Everybody concerns himself about his own interests, not about those of Jesus Christ.
29414	50	2	22	 But you know Timothy's approved worth--how, like a child working with his father, he has served with me in furtherance of the Good News.
29415	50	2	23	 So it is he that I hope to send as soon as ever I see how things go with me;
29416	50	2	24	 but trusting, as I do, in the Lord, I believe that I shall myself also come to you before long.
29417	50	2	25	 Yet I  deem it important to send Epaphroditus to you now--he is my brother and comrade both in labour and in arms, and is your messenger who has ministered to my needs.
29418	50	2	26	 I send him because he is longing  to see you all and is distressed at your having heard of his illness.
29419	50	2	27	 For it is true that he has been ill, and was apparently at the point of death; but God had pity on him, and not only on him, but also on me, to save me from having sorrow upon sorrow.
29420	50	2	28	 I am therefore all the more eager to send him, in the hope that when you see him  again you may be glad and I may have the less sorrow.
29421	50	2	29	 Receive him therefore with heartfelt Christian joy, and hold in honour men like him;
29422	50	2	30	 because it was for the sake of Christ's work that he came so near death, hazarding, as he did, his very life in endeavouring to make good any deficiency that there might be in your gifts to me.
29423	50	3	1	 In conclusion, my brethren, be joyful in the Lord. For me to give you the same warnings as before is not irksome to me, while so far as you are concerned it is a safe precaution.
29424	50	3	2	 Beware of `the dogs,' the  bad workmen, the self-mutilators.
29425	50	3	3	 For we are the true circumcision--we who  render to God a spiritual worship and make our boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in  outward ceremonies:
29426	50	3	4	 although I myself might have some excuse for confidence in outward ceremonies. If any one else claims a right to trust in them, far more may I:
29427	50	3	5	 circumcised, as I was, on the eighth day, a member of the race of Israel and of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew sprung from Hebrews; as to the Law a Pharisee;
29428	50	3	6	 as to zeal, a persecutor of the Church; as to the righteousness which comes through Law, blameless.
29429	50	3	7	 Yet all that was gain to me--for Christ's sake I have reckoned it loss.
29430	50	3	8	 Nay, I even reckon all things as  pure loss because of the priceless privilege of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. And for His sake I have suffered the loss of everything, and reckon it all as mere refuse, in order that I may win Christ and be found in union with Him,
29431	50	3	9	 not having a righteousness of my own, derived from the Law, but that which arises from faith in Christ--the righteousness which comes from God through faith.
29432	50	3	10	 I long to know Christ and the power which is in His resurrection, and to share in His sufferings and die even as He died;
29433	50	3	11	 in the hope that I may attain to  the resurrection from among the dead.
29434	50	3	12	 I do not say that I have already won the race or have already  reached perfection. But I am pressing on, striving to lay hold of the prize for which also Christ has laid hold of me.
29435	50	3	13	 Brethren, I do not imagine that I have yet laid hold of it. But this one thing I do--forgetting everything which is past and stretching forward to what lies in front of me,
29436	50	3	14	 with my eyes fixed on the goal I push on to secure the prize of God's  heavenward call in Christ Jesus.
29437	50	3	15	 Therefore let all of us who are mature believers cherish these thoughts; and if in any respect you think differently, that also God will make clear to you.
29438	50	3	16	 But whatever be the point that we have already reached, let us persevere in the same course.
29439	50	3	17	 Brethren, vie with one another in imitating me, and carefully observe those who follow the example which we have set you.
29440	50	3	18	 For there are  many whom I have often described to you, and I now even with tears describe them, as being enemies to the Cross of Christ.
29441	50	3	19	 Their end is destruction, their bellies are their God, their glory is in their shame, and their minds are devoted to earthly things.
29442	50	3	20	 We, however, are free citizens of Heaven, and we are waiting with longing expectation for the coming from Heaven of  a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ,
29443	50	3	21	 who, in the exercise of the power which He has even to subject all things to Himself, will transform this body of our humiliation until it resembles His own glorious body.
29444	50	4	1	 Therefore, my brethren, dearly loved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, my dearly-loved ones.
29445	50	4	2	 I entreat Euodia, and I entreat Syntyche, to be of one mind,  as sisters in Christ.
29446	50	4	3	 Yes, and I beg you also, my faithful yoke-fellow, to help these women who have shared my toil in connection with the Good News, together with Clement and the rest of my fellow labourers, whose names are recorded in the Book of Life.
29447	50	4	4	 Always be glad in the Lord: I will repeat it, be glad.
29448	50	4	5	 Let your  forbearing spirit be known to every one--the Lord is near.
29449	50	4	6	 Do not be over-anxious about anything, but by prayer and earnest pleading, together with thanksgiving, let your request be unreservedly made known in the presence of God.
29450	50	4	7	 And then the peace of God, which transcends all our powers of thought, will be a garrison to guard your hearts and minds in union with Christ Jesus.
29451	50	4	8	 Finally, brethren, whatever is  true, whatever wins respect, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovable, whatever is of good repute--if there is any virtue or anything deemed worthy of praise--cherish the thought of these things.
29452	50	4	9	 The doctrines and  the line of conduct which I taught you--both what you heard and what you saw in me--  hold fast to them; and God who gives peace will be with you.
29453	50	4	10	 But I rejoice with a deep and holy joy that now at length you have revived your thoughtfulness for my welfare. Indeed you have always been thoughtful for me, although opportunity failed you.
29454	50	4	11	 I do not refer to this through fear of privation, for (for my part) I have learned, whatever be my outward experiences, to be content.
29455	50	4	12	 I know both how to live in humble circumstances and how to live amid abundance. I am  fully initiated into all the mysteries both of fulness and of hunger, of abundance and of want.
29456	50	4	13	 I have strength for anything through Him who gives me power.
29457	50	4	14	 Yet I thank you for taking your share in my troubles.
29458	50	4	15	 And you men and women of Philippi also know that at the first preaching of the Good News, when I had left Macedonia, no other Church except yourselves held communication with me about giving and receiving;
29459	50	4	16	 because even in Thessalonica you sent several times to minister to my needs.
29460	50	4	17	 Not that I crave for gifts from you, but I do want to see abundant fruit bring you honour.
29461	50	4	18	 I have enough of everything--and more than enough. My wants are fully satisfied now that I have received from the hands of Epaphroditus the generous gifts which you sent me--they are a fragrant odor, an acceptable sacrifice, truly pleasing to God.
29462	50	4	19	 But my God--so great is His  wealth of glory in Christ Jesus--will fully supply every need of yours.
29463	50	4	20	 And to our God and Father be the glory throughout the Ages of the Ages! Amen.
29464	50	4	21	 My Christian greetings to every one of God's people. The brethren who are with me send their greetings.
29465	50	4	22	 All God's people here greet you--especially the members of Caesar's household.
29466	50	4	23	 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirits.
29467	51	1	1	 Paul, an Apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God--and Timothy our brother:
29468	51	1	2	 To the people of God and the believing brethren at  Colossae who are in Christ. May grace and peace be granted to you from God our Father.
29469	51	1	3	 We give thanks  to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, constantly praying for you as we do,
29470	51	1	4	 because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which you cherish towards all God's people,
29471	51	1	5	 on account of the hope treasured up for you in Heaven. Of this hope you have already heard in the Message of the truth of the Good News.
29472	51	1	6	 For it has reached you, and remains with you, just as  it has also spread through the whole world, yielding fruit there and increasing, as it has done among you from the day when  first you heard it and came really to know the grace of God,
29473	51	1	7	 as you learned it from Epaphras our dearly-loved fellow servant. He is to you a faithful minister of Christ in our stead,
29474	51	1	8	 and moreover he has informed us of your love, which is inspired by the Spirit.
29475	51	1	9	 For this reason we also, from the day we  first received these tidings,  have never ceased to pray for you and to entreat that you may be filled with a clear knowledge of His will accompanied by thorough wisdom and discernment in spiritual things;
29476	51	1	10	 so that your lives may be worthy of the Lord and perfectly pleasing to Him, while you exhibit the results of right action of every sort and grow into a fuller knowledge of God.
29477	51	1	11	 Since His power is so glorious, may you be strengthened with strength of every kind, and be prepared for cheerfully enduring all things with patience and long-suffering;
29478	51	1	12	 and give thanks to the Father who has made us fit to receive our share of the inheritance of God's people in Light.
29479	51	1	13	 It is God who has delivered us out of the dominion of darkness, and has transferred us into the Kingdom of His dearly-loved Son,
29480	51	1	14	 in whom we have our redemption--the forgiveness of our sins.
29481	51	1	15	 Christ is the  visible representation of the invisible God,  the Firstborn and Lord of all creation.
29482	51	1	16	 For  in Him was created the universe of things in heaven and on earth, things seen and things unseen,  thrones, dominions, princedoms, powers--all were created,  and exist through and for Him.
29483	51	1	17	 And  HE IS before all things and in and through Him the universe is a harmonious whole.
29484	51	1	18	 Moreover He is the Head of His Body, the Church. He is the Beginning, the Firstborn from among the dead, in order that He Himself may in all things occupy the foremost place.
29485	51	1	19	 For it was the Father's gracious will that the whole of the divine perfections should dwell in Him.
29486	51	1	20	 And God purposed through Him to reconcile the universe to Himself, making peace through His blood, which was shed upon the Cross--to reconcile to Himself through Him, I say, things on earth and things in Heaven.
29487	51	1	21	 And you, estranged as you once were and even hostile in your minds, amidst your evil deeds,
29488	51	1	22	  He has now, in His human body, reconciled to God by His death, to bring you, holy and faultless and irreproachable, into His presence;
29489	51	1	23	 if, indeed, you are still firmly holding to faith as your foundation, without ever shifting from your hope that rests on the Good News that you have heard, which has been proclaimed in the whole creation under Heaven, and in which I Paul have been appointed to serve.
29490	51	1	24	 Now I can find joy amid my sufferings for you, and I fill up in my own person whatever is lacking in Christ's afflictions on behalf of His Body, the Church.
29491	51	1	25	 I have been appointed to serve the Church in the position of responsibility entrusted to me by God for your benefit, so that I may fully deliver God's Message--
29492	51	1	26	 the truth which has been kept secret from all ages and generations, but has now been revealed to His people,
29493	51	1	27	 to whom it was His will to make known how vast a wealth of glory for the Gentile world is implied in this truth--the truth that `Christ is in you, the hope of glory.'
29494	51	1	28	 Him we preach, admonishing every one and instructing every one, with all possible wisdom, so that we may bring every one into God's presence, made perfect through Christ.
29495	51	1	29	 To this end, like an earnest wrestler, I exert all my strength in reliance upon the power of Him who is mightily at work within me.
29496	51	2	1	 For I would have you know in how severe a struggle I am engaged on behalf of you and the brethren in Laodicea and of all who have not known me personally,
29497	51	2	2	 in order that their hearts may be cheered, they themselves being welded together in love and enjoying all the advantages of a reasonable certainty, till at last they attain the full knowledge of God's truth, which is Christ Himself.
29498	51	2	3	 In Him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are stored up, hidden from view.
29499	51	2	4	 I say this to prevent your being misled by any one's plausible sophistry.
29500	51	2	5	 For although, as you say, I am absent from you in body, yet in spirit I am present with you and am delighted to witness your good  discipline and the  solid front presented by your faith in Christ.
29501	51	2	6	 As therefore you have received the Christ, even Jesus our Lord,  live and act in vital union with Him;
29502	51	2	7	 having the roots of your being firmly planted in Him, and continually building yourselves up in Him, and always being increasingly confirmed in the faith as you were taught it, and abounding  in it with thanksgiving.
29503	51	2	8	 Take care lest there be some one who leads you away as prisoners by means of his philosophy and idle fancies, following human traditions and the world's crude notions instead of following Christ.
29504	51	2	9	 For it is in Christ that the fulness of God's nature dwells embodied, and in Him you are made complete,
29505	51	2	10	 and He is the  Lord of all  princes and rulers.
29506	51	2	11	 In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not performed by hand, when you threw off your sinful nature in true Christian circumcision;
29507	51	2	12	 having been buried with Him in your baptism, in which you were also raised with Him through faith produced within you by God who raised Him from among the dead.
29508	51	2	13	 And to you--dead as you once were in your transgressions and in the uncircumcision of your natural state--He has nevertheless given Life with Himself, having forgiven us all our transgressions.
29509	51	2	14	 The bond,  with its requirements, which was in force against us and was hostile to us, He cancelled, and cleared it out of the way, nailing it to His Cross.
29510	51	2	15	  And the hostile princes and rulers He shook off from Himself, and boldly displayed them as His conquests, when by the Cross He triumphed over them.
29511	51	2	16	  Therefore suffer no one to sit in judgement on you as to eating or drinking or with regard to a festival, a new moon or a sabbath.
29512	51	2	17	 These were a shadow of things that were soon to come, but the substance belongs to Christ.
29513	51	2	18	 Let no one defraud you of your prize,  priding himself on his humility and on his worship of the angels, and taking his stand on the visions he has seen, and idly puffed up with his unspiritual thoughts.
29514	51	2	19	 Such a one does not keep his hold upon Christ, the Head, from whom the Body, in all its parts nourished and strengthened by its points of contact and its connections, grows with a divine growth.
29515	51	2	20	 If you have died with Christ and have escaped from the world's rudimentary notions, why, as though your life still belonged to the world, do you submit to such precepts as
29516	51	2	21	 "Do not handle this;" "Do not taste that;" "Do not touch that other thing" --
29517	51	2	22	 referring to things which are all intended to be used up and perish--in obedience to mere human injunctions and teachings?
29518	51	2	23	 These rules have indeed an appearance of wisdom where self-imposed worship exists, and an affectation of humility and an ascetic severity. But not one of them is of any value in combating the indulgence of our lower natures.
29519	51	3	1	  If however you  have risen with Christ,  seek the things that are above, where Christ is, enthroned at God's right hand.
29520	51	3	2	 Give your minds to the things that are above, not to the things that are on the earth.
29521	51	3	3	 For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
29522	51	3	4	 When Christ appears--He is  our true Life--then you also will appear with Him in glory.
29523	51	3	5	 Therefore put to death your earthward inclinations--fornication, impurity, sensual passion, unholy desire, and all greed, for that is a form of idolatry.
29524	51	3	6	 It is on account of these very sins that God's anger is coming,
29525	51	3	7	 and you also were once addicted to them, while you were living under their power.
29526	51	3	8	 But now you must rid yourselves of every kind of sin--angry and passionate outbreaks, ill-will, evil speaking, foul-mouthed abuse--so that these may never soil your lips.
29527	51	3	9	 Do not speak falsehoods to one another, for you have stripped off the old self with its doings,
29528	51	3	10	 and have clothed yourselves with the new self which is being remoulded into full knowledge so as to become like Him who created it.
29529	51	3	11	 In that new creation  there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free man, but Christ is everything and is  in all of us.
29530	51	3	12	 Clothe yourselves therefore, as God's own people holy and dearly loved, with tender-heartedness, kindness, lowliness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;
29531	51	3	13	 bearing with one another and readily forgiving each other, if any one has a grievance against another. Just as  the Lord has forgiven you, you also must forgive.
29532	51	3	14	 And over all these put on love, which is the perfect bond of union;
29533	51	3	15	 and let the peace which Christ gives settle all questionings in your hearts, to which peace indeed you were called as belonging to His one Body; and be thankful.
29534	51	3	16	 Let the teaching  concerning Christ remain as a rich treasure in your hearts.  In all wisdom teach and admonish one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, and sing with grace in your hearts to God.
29535	51	3	17	 And whatever you do, in word or in deed, do everything  in the name of the Lord Jesus, and let it be through Him that you give thanks to God the Father.
29536	51	3	18	 Married women, be submissive to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
29537	51	3	19	 Married men, be affectionate to your wives, and do not treat them harshly.
29538	51	3	20	 Children be obedient to your parents in everything; for that is right for Christians.
29539	51	3	21	 Fathers, do not fret and harass your children, or you may make them sullen and morose.
29540	51	3	22	 Slaves, be obedient in everything to your earthly masters; not  in acts of eye service, as aiming only to please men, but with simplicity of purpose, because you fear the Lord.
29541	51	3	23	 Whatever you are doing, let your hearts be in your work, as a thing done for the Lord and not for men.
29542	51	3	24	 For you know that it is from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. Christ is the Master whose bondservants you are.
29543	51	3	25	 The man who perpetrates a wrong will find the wrong repaid to him; and with God there are  no merely earthly distinctions.
29544	51	4	1	 Masters, deal justly and equitably with your slaves, knowing that you too have a Master in Heaven.
29545	51	4	2	 Be earnest and unwearied in prayer, being on the alert in it and in your giving of thanks.
29546	51	4	3	 And pray at the same time for us also, that God may open for us a door for preaching, for us to tell the truth concerning Christ for the sake of which I am even a prisoner.
29547	51	4	4	 Then I shall proclaim it fully, as it is my duty to do.
29548	51	4	5	 Behave wisely in relation to the outside world, buying up your opportunities.
29549	51	4	6	 Let your language be always seasoned with the salt of grace, so that you may know how to give every man  a fitting answer.
29550	51	4	7	 Tychicus, our much-loved brother, a trusty assistant and fellow servant with us in the Lord's work, will give you every information about me.
29551	51	4	8	 And for this very purpose I send him to you that you may know how we are faring; and that he may cheer your hearts.
29552	51	4	9	 And with him I send our dear and trusty brother Onesimus, who is one of yourselves. They will inform you of everything here.
29553	51	4	10	 Aristarchus my fellow prisoner sends greeting to you, and so does Barnabas's cousin Mark. You have received instructions as to him; if he comes to you, give him a welcome.
29554	51	4	11	 Jesus, called Justus, also sends greeting. These three are Hebrew converts. They alone among such have worked loyally with me for the Kingdom of God--they are men who have been a comfort to me.
29555	51	4	12	 Epaphras, who is one of yourselves, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, sends greetings to you, always wrestling on your behalf in his prayers, that you may stand firm--Christians of ripe character and of clear conviction as to everything which is God's will.
29556	51	4	13	 For I can bear witness to the deep interest he takes in you and in the brethren at Laodicea and in those at Hierapolis.
29557	51	4	14	 Luke, the dearly-loved physician, salutes you, and so does Demas.
29558	51	4	15	 Christian greetings to the brethren at Laodicea, especially to Nymphas, and to  the Church that meets at their house.
29559	51	4	16	 And when this Letter has been read  among you, let it be read also in the Church of the Laodiceans, and you in turn must read the one I am sending to Laodicea.
29560	51	4	17	 And tell Archippus to discharge carefully the duties devolving upon him as a servant of the Lord.
29561	51	4	18	 I Paul add with my own hand this final greeting. Be mindful of me in my imprisonment. Grace be with you.
29562	52	1	1	 Paul,  Silas, and Timothy: To the Church  of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. May grace and peace be granted to you.
29563	52	1	2	 We continually give thanks to God because of you all, while we make mention of you in our prayers.
29564	52	1	3	 For we never fail to remember your works of faith and labours of love and your persistent and unwavering hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father;
29565	52	1	4	 knowing as we do, brethren, that you are beloved by God and that He has chosen you.
29566	52	1	5	 The Good News that we brought you did not come to you in words only, but also with power and with the Holy Spirit and with much certainty, for you know the sort of men we became among you, as examples for your sakes.
29567	52	1	6	 And you followed the pattern set you by us and by the Master, after you had received the Message amid severe persecution, and yet with the joy which the Holy Spirit gives,
29568	52	1	7	 so that you became a pattern to all the believers throughout Macedonia and  Greece.
29569	52	1	8	 For it was not only from you that the Master's Message  sounded forth throughout Macedonia and  Greece; but everywhere your faith in God has become known, so that it is unnecessary for us to say anything about it.
29570	52	1	9	 For when  others speak of us they report the reception we had from you, and how you turned from your idols to God, to be bondservants of the true and ever-living God,
29571	52	1	10	 and to await the return from Heaven of His Son, whom He raised from among the dead--even Jesus, our Deliverer from God's coming anger.
29572	52	2	1	 For you yourselves, brethren, know that our visit to you  did not fail of its purpose.
29573	52	2	2	 But, as you will remember, after we had already met with suffering and outrage at Philippi, we summoned up boldness, by the help of our God, to tell you God's Good News amid much opposition.
29574	52	2	3	 For our  preaching was not grounded on a delusion, nor prompted by mingled motives, nor was there fraud in it.
29575	52	2	4	 But as God tested and approved us before entrusting us with His Good News, so in what we say we are seeking not to please men but to please God, who tests and approves our motives.
29576	52	2	5	 For, as you are well aware, we have never used the language of flattery nor have we found pretexts for enriching ourselves--God is our witness;
29577	52	2	6	 nor did we seek glory either from you or from any other mere men, although we might have stood on our dignity as Christ's Apostles.
29578	52	2	7	 On the contrary, in our relations to you  we showed ourselves as gentle as a mother is when she tenderly nurses her own children.
29579	52	2	8	 Seeing that we were thus drawn affectionately towards you, it would have been a joy to us to have imparted to you not only God's Good News, but to have given our very  lives also, because you had become very dear to us.
29580	52	2	9	  For  you remember, brethren, our labour and toil: how, working night and day so as not to become a burden to any one of you, we came and proclaimed among you God's Good News.
29581	52	2	10	 You yourselves are witnesses--and God is witness--how holy and upright and blameless our dealings with you believers were.
29582	52	2	11	 For you know that we acted towards every one of you as a father does towards his own children, encouraging and cheering you,
29583	52	2	12	 and imploring you to live lives worthy of fellowship with God who is inviting you to share His own Kingship and glory.
29584	52	2	13	 And for this further reason we render unceasing thanks to God, that when you received God's Message from our lips, it was as no mere message from men that you embraced it, but as--what it really is--God's Message, which also does its work  in the hearts of you who believe.
29585	52	2	14	 For you, brethren, followed the example of the Churches of God in Christ Jesus which are in Judaea; seeing that you endured the same ill-treatment at the hands of your countrymen, as they did at the hands of the Jews.
29586	52	2	15	 Those Jewish persecutors killed both the Lord Jesus and the Prophets, and drove us out of their midst. They are displeasing to God, and are the enemies of all mankind;
29587	52	2	16	 for they still try to prevent our preaching to the Gentiles so that they may find salvation. They thus continually fill up the measure of their own sins, and God's anger in its severest form has overtaken them.
29588	52	2	17	 But we, brethren, having been for a short time separated from you in bodily presence, though not in heart, endeavoured all the more earnestly, with intense longing, to see you face to face.
29589	52	2	18	 On this account we wanted to come to you--at least I Paul wanted again and again to do so--but Satan hindered us.
29590	52	2	19	 For what is our hope or joy, or the crown of which we boast? Is it not you yourselves in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His Coming?
29591	52	2	20	 Yes, you are our glory and our joy.
29592	52	3	1	 So when we could endure it no longer, we decided to remain behind in Athens alone;
29593	52	3	2	 and sent Timothy our brother and  God's minister in the service of Christ's Good News, that he might help you spiritually and encourage you in your faith;
29594	52	3	3	 that none of you might be unnerved by your present trials: for you yourselves know that they are our appointed lot.
29595	52	3	4	 For even when we were with you, we forewarned you, saying, "We are soon to suffer affliction;" and this actually happened, as you well know.
29596	52	3	5	 For this reason I also, when I could no longer endure the uncertainty, sent to know the condition of your faith, lest perchance the Tempter might have tempted you and our labour have been lost.
29597	52	3	6	 But now that Timothy has recently come back to us from you, and has brought us the happy tidings of your faith and love, and has told us how you still cherish a constant and affectionate recollection of us, and are longing to see us as we also long to see you--
29598	52	3	7	 for this reason in our distress and trouble we have been comforted about you, brethren, by your faith.
29599	52	3	8	 For now life is for us life indeed, since you are standing fast in the Lord.
29600	52	3	9	 For what thanksgiving on your behalf can we possibly offer to God in return for all the joy which fills our souls before our God for you,
29601	52	3	10	 while night and day, with intense earnestness, we pray that we may see your faces, and may bring to perfection whatever may be still lacking in your faith?
29602	52	3	11	 But may our God and Father Himself--and our Lord Jesus--guide us on our way to you;
29603	52	3	12	 and as for you, may the Lord teach you to love one another and all men, with a growing and a glowing love, resembling our love for you.
29604	52	3	13	 Thus He will build up your characters, so that you will be faultlessly holy in the presence of our God and Father at the Coming of our Lord Jesus with all His  holy ones.
29605	52	4	1	  Moreover, brethren, as you learnt from our lips the lives which you ought to live, and do live, so as to please God, we beg and exhort you in the name of the Lord Jesus to live them more and more truly.
29606	52	4	2	 For you know the commands which we laid upon you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.
29607	52	4	3	 For this is God's will--your purity of life, that you abstain from fornication;
29608	52	4	4	 that each man among you shall know how to procure a  wife who shall be his own in purity and honour;
29609	52	4	5	 that you be not overmastered by lustful cravings, like the Gentiles who have no knowledge of God;
29610	52	4	6	 and  that in this matter there be no encroaching on the rights of a brother Christian and no overreaching him. For the Lord is an avenger in all such cases, as we have already taught you and solemnly warned you.
29611	52	4	7	 God has not called us to an unclean life, but to one of purity.
29612	52	4	8	 Therefore  a defiant spirit in such a case provokes not man but God, who puts His Holy Spirit into your hearts.
29613	52	4	9	 But on the subject of love for the brotherhood it is unnecessary for me to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another;
29614	52	4	10	 and indeed you do love all the brethren throughout Macedonia. And we exhort you to do so more and more,
29615	52	4	11	 and to vie with one another in eagerness for peace, every one minding his own business and working with his hands, as we ordered you to do:
29616	52	4	12	 so as to live worthy lives in relation to outsiders, and  not be a burden to any one.
29617	52	4	13	 Now, concerning  those who from time to time pass away, we would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, lest you should mourn as others do who have no hope.
29618	52	4	14	 For if we believe that Jesus has died and risen again, we also believe that, through Jesus, God will bring with Him those who shall have passed away.
29619	52	4	15	 For this we declare to you on the Lord's own authority--that  we who are alive and continue on earth until the Coming of the Lord, shall certainly not forestall those who  shall have previously  passed away.
29620	52	4	16	 For the Lord Himself will come down from Heaven with a loud word of command, and with an archangel's voice and the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
29621	52	4	17	 Afterwards we who are alive and are still on earth will be  caught up in their company amid clouds to meet the Lord in the air.
29622	52	4	18	 And so we shall be with the Lord for ever. Therefore encourage one another with these words.
29623	52	5	1	 But as to times and dates it is unnecessary that anything be written to you.
29624	52	5	2	 For you yourselves know perfectly well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.
29625	52	5	3	 While they are saying "Peace and safety!" then in a moment destruction falls upon them, like birth-pains on a woman who is with child; and escape there is none.
29626	52	5	4	 But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that daylight should surprise you like a thief;
29627	52	5	5	 for all of you are sons of Light and sons of the day. We belong neither to the night nor to darkness.
29628	52	5	6	 So then let us not sleep, like the rest of the world, but let us keep awake and be sober.
29629	52	5	7	 For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who drink freely, drink at night.
29630	52	5	8	 But let us, belonging--as we do--to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation.
29631	52	5	9	 For God has not pre-destined us to meet His anger, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ;
29632	52	5	10	 who died on our behalf, so that whether we are  awake or are sleeping we may share His Life.
29633	52	5	11	 Therefore encourage one another, and let each one help to strengthen his friend, as in fact you do.
29634	52	5	12	 Now we beg you, brethren, to  show respect for those who labour among you and are your leaders in Christian work, and are your advisers;
29635	52	5	13	 and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves.
29636	52	5	14	 And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the unruly, comfort the timid, sustain the weak, and be patient towards all.
29637	52	5	15	 See to it that no one ever repays another with evil for evil; but always seek opportunities of doing good both to one another and to all the world.
29638	52	5	16	 Be always joyful.
29639	52	5	17	 Be unceasing in prayer.
29640	52	5	18	 In every circumstance of life be thankful; for this is God's will in Christ Jesus respecting you.
29641	52	5	19	 Do not quench the Spirit.
29642	52	5	20	 Do not think meanly of utterances of prophecy;
29643	52	5	21	 but test all such, and retain hold of the good.
29644	52	5	22	 Hold yourselves aloof from every form of evil.
29645	52	5	23	 And may God Himself who gives peace, make you entirely holy; and may your spirits, souls and  bodies be preserved complete and be found blameless at the Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
29646	52	5	24	 Faithful is He who calls you, and He will also perfect His work.
29647	52	5	25	 Brethren, pray for us.
29648	52	5	26	 Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.
29649	52	5	27	 I solemnly charge you in the Lord's name to have this Letter read to all the brethren.
29650	52	5	28	 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
29651	53	1	1	 Paul,  Silas, and Timothy: To the Church of the Thessalonians which is in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
29652	53	1	2	 May grace and peace be granted to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
29653	53	1	3	 Unceasing thanks are due from us to God on your behalf, brethren. They are appropriate because your faith is growing greatly, and the love of every one of you for all the others goes on increasing.
29654	53	1	4	 It so increases that we ourselves make honourable mention of you among the Churches of God because of your patience and faith amid all your persecutions and amid the afflictions which you are enduring.
29655	53	1	5	 For these are a plain token of God's righteous judgement, which has in view your being deemed worthy of admission to God's Kingdom, for the sake of which, indeed, you are sufferers.
29656	53	1	6	 A plain token of God's righteous judgement, I say, since it is a righteous thing for Him to requite with affliction those who are now afflicting you;
29657	53	1	7	 and to requite with rest you who are suffering affliction now--rest with us at the  re-appearing of the Lord Jesus from Heaven, attended by His mighty angels.
29658	53	1	8	 He will come in flames of fire to take vengeance on those who have no knowledge of God, and do not obey the Good News as to Jesus, our Lord.
29659	53	1	9	 They will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, being banished from the presence of the Lord and from  His glorious majesty,
29660	53	1	10	 when He  comes on that day to be glorified in His people and to be wondered at among all who  have believed, including you--because you believed the testimony which we brought for your acceptance.
29661	53	1	11	 It is with this view also that we continually pray to our God for you, asking that He will count you worthy of His call, and by His mighty power fully gratify your every desire for what is truly good and make your work of faith complete;
29662	53	1	12	 in order that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and that you may be glorified in Him--so wonderful is the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ!
29663	53	2	1	 But with respect to the Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and  our being  gathered to meet Him, we entreat you, brethren,
29664	53	2	2	 not readily to become unsettled in mind or troubled--either by any pretended spiritual revelation or by any message or letter claiming to have been sent by us--through fancying that the day of the Lord is now here.
29665	53	2	3	 Let no one in any way deceive you, for that day cannot come without the coming of the apostasy first, and  the appearing of  the man of sin, the son of perdition, who sets himself against,
29666	53	2	4	 and exalts himself above, every so-called `god' or object of worship, and goes the length of taking his seat in the very temple of God, giving it out that he himself is God.
29667	53	2	5	 Do you not remember that while I was still with you I used to tell you all this?
29668	53	2	6	 And now you know  what restrains him, in order that his true character may be revealed at his appointed time.
29669	53	2	7	 For lawlessness is already at work in secret; but only until the man who is now exercising a restraining influence is removed,
29670	53	2	8	 and then the Lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will sweep away with the  tempest of His anger, and utterly overwhelm by the awful splendour of His Coming.
29671	53	2	9	 The appearing of the Lawless one will be attended by various miracles and tokens and delusive marvels--for so Satan works--
29672	53	2	10	 and by every kind of wicked deception for those who are on the way to perdition because they did not welcome into their hearts the love of the truth, so that they might be saved.
29673	53	2	11	 And for this reason God sends them a misleading influence that they may believe  the lie;
29674	53	2	12	 in order that all may come under judgement who have refused to believe the truth and have taken pleasure in unrighteousness.
29675	53	2	13	 And from us thanks are always due to God on your behalf--brethren whom the Lord loves--because God  from the beginning has chosen you for salvation  through the Spirit's sanctifying influence and your belief in the truth.
29676	53	2	14	 To this blessing God has called you by our Good News, so that you may have a share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
29677	53	2	15	 So then, brethren, stand your ground, and hold fast to the teachings which you have received from us, whether by word of mouth or by letter.
29678	53	2	16	 And may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself--and God our Father who has loved us and has given us in His grace eternal consolation and a bright hope--
29679	53	2	17	 comfort your hearts and make you stedfast in every good work and word.
29680	53	3	1	 Finally, brethren, pray for us, asking that the Lord's Message  may be spread rapidly and its glory be displayed, as it was displayed among you;
29681	53	3	2	 and that we may be delivered from wrong-headed and wicked men; for it is not everybody who has faith.
29682	53	3	3	 But the Lord is faithful, and He will make you stedfast and will guard you from the Evil one.
29683	53	3	4	 And we have confidence in the Lord in regard to you that you are doing, and will do, what we command.
29684	53	3	5	 And may the Lord guide your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Christ.
29685	53	3	6	 But,  by the authority of  the Lord, we command you, brethren, to stand aloof from every brother whose life is disorderly and not in accordance with the teaching which all received from us.
29686	53	3	7	 For you yourselves know that it is your duty to follow our example. There was no disorder in our lives among you,
29687	53	3	8	 nor did we eat any one's bread  without paying for it, but we laboured and toiled, working hard night and day in order not to be a burden to any of you.
29688	53	3	9	 This was not because we had not  a claim upon you, but it arose from a desire to set you an example--for you to imitate us.
29689	53	3	10	 For even when we were with you, we laid down this rule for you: "If a man does not choose to work, neither shall he eat."
29690	53	3	11	 For we hear that there are some of you who live disorderly lives and are mere idle busybodies.
29691	53	3	12	 To persons of that sort our injunction--and our command by the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ--is that they are to work quietly and eat their own honestly-earned bread.
29692	53	3	13	 But you, brethren, must not grow weary  in the path of duty;
29693	53	3	14	 and if any one refuses to obey these our written instructions, mark that man and hold no communication with him--so that he may be made to feel ashamed.
29694	53	3	15	 And yet do not regard him as an enemy, but caution him as a brother.
29695	53	3	16	 And may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every sense. The Lord be with you all.
29696	53	3	17	 I Paul add the greeting with my own hand, which is the credential in every letter of mine.
29697	53	3	18	 This is my handwriting. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
29698	54	1	1	 Paul, an Apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God our Saviour and Christ Jesus our hope:
29699	54	1	2	 To Timothy, my own true son in the faith. May grace, mercy and peace be granted to you from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
29700	54	1	3	 When I was on my journey to Macedonia I begged you to remain on in Ephesus that you might remonstrate with certain persons because of their  erroneous teaching
29701	54	1	4	 and the attention they bestow on mere fables and endless  pedigrees, such as lead to controversy rather than to a true stewardship for God, which only exists where there is faith. And I make the same request now.
29702	54	1	5	 But the end sought to be secured by exhortation is the love which springs from a pure heart, a clear conscience and a sincere faith.
29703	54	1	6	 From these some have  drifted away, and have wandered into empty words.
29704	54	1	7	 They are ambitious to be teachers of the Law, although they do not understand either their own words or what the things are about which they make such confident assertions.
29705	54	1	8	 Now we know that the Law is good, if a man uses it in the way it should be used,
29706	54	1	9	 and remembers that a law is not enacted to control a righteous man, but for the lawless and rebellious, the irreligious and sinful, the godless and profane--for those who strike their fathers or their mothers, for murderers,
29707	54	1	10	 fornicators, sodomites, slave-dealers, liars and false witnesses; and for whatever else is opposed to wholesome teaching
29708	54	1	11	 and is not in accordance with the Good News of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted.
29709	54	1	12	 I am thankful to Him who made me strong--even Christ Jesus our Lord--because He has judged me to be faithful and has put me into His service,
29710	54	1	13	 though I was previously a blasphemer and a persecutor and had been insolent in outrage. Yet mercy was shown me, because  I had acted ignorantly, not having as yet believed;
29711	54	1	14	 and the grace of our Lord came to me in overflowing fulness, conferring faith on me and the love which is in Christ Jesus.
29712	54	1	15	 Faithful is the saying, and deserving of universal acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; among whom I stand  foremost.
29713	54	1	16	 But mercy was shown me in order that in me as the foremost of sinners Christ Jesus might display the fulness of His long-suffering patience as an example to encourage those who would  afterwards be resting their faith on Him with a view to the Life of the Ages.
29714	54	1	17	 Now to the immortal and invisible King of the Ages, who alone is God, be honour and glory to the Ages of the Ages! Amen.
29715	54	1	18	 This is the charge which I entrust to you, my son Timothy, in accordance with the inspired instructions concerning you which were given me long ago, that being equipped with them as your armour you may be continually fighting the good fight,
29716	54	1	19	 holding fast to faith and a clear conscience, which some have cast aside and have made shipwreck of their faith.
29717	54	1	20	 Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan so that they may be  taught not to blaspheme.
29718	54	2	1	 I exhort then, first of all, that  supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be offered on behalf of all men;
29719	54	2	2	 including kings and all who are in high station, in order that we may live peaceful and tranquil lives with all godliness and  gravity.
29720	54	2	3	 This is right, and is pleasing in the sight of God our Saviour,
29721	54	2	4	 who is willing for  all mankind to be saved and come to a full knowledge of the truth.
29722	54	2	5	 For there is but one God and but one Mediator between God and men--Christ Jesus,  Himself man;
29723	54	2	6	 who gave Himself as the redemption price for all--a fact testified to at its own appointed time,
29724	54	2	7	 and of which I have been appointed a herald and an Apostle (I am speaking the truth: it is not a fiction), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
29725	54	2	8	 So then I would have  the men  everywhere pray, lifting to God holy hands which are  unstained with anger or strife;
29726	54	2	9	 and I would have the women dress becomingly, with modesty and self-control, not with plaited hair or gold or pearls or costly clothes,
29727	54	2	10	 but--as befits women making a claim to godliness--with the ornament of good works.
29728	54	2	11	  A woman should quietly learn from others with entire submissiveness.
29729	54	2	12	 I do not permit  a woman to teach, nor have authority over  a man, but she must remain silent.
29730	54	2	13	 For Adam was formed first, and then Eve;
29731	54	2	14	 and Adam was not deceived, but his wife was thoroughly deceived, and so  became involved in transgression.
29732	54	2	15	 Yet a woman will be  brought safely through childbirth if  she and her husband continue to live in faith and love and growing holiness, with habitual self-restraint.
29733	54	3	1	 Faithful is the saying, "If any one is eager to have the oversight of a Church, he desires a noble work."
29734	54	3	2	 A  minister then must be a man of irreproachable character,  true to his one wife, temperate, sober-minded, well-behaved,  hospitable to strangers, and with a gift for teaching;
29735	54	3	3	 not a hard drinker nor given to blows; not selfish or quarrelsome or covetous;
29736	54	3	4	 but ruling his own household wisely and well, with children kept under control with true dignity.
29737	54	3	5	 (If a man does not know how to rule his own household, how shall he have the Church of God given into his care?)
29738	54	3	6	 He ought not to be a new convert, for fear he should be blinded with pride and come under the same condemnation as the Devil.
29739	54	3	7	 It is needful also that he bear a good character with people outside the Church, lest he fall into reproach or a snare of the Devil.
29740	54	3	8	 Deacons, in the same way, must be men of serious demeanour, not double-tongued, nor addicted to much wine, nor greedy of base gain,
29741	54	3	9	 but holding the secret truths of the faith with a clear conscience.
29742	54	3	10	 And they must also be well-tried men, and when found to be of unblemished character then let them serve as deacons.
29743	54	3	11	 Deaconesses, in the same way, must be sober-minded women, not slanderers, but in every way temperate and trustworthy.
29744	54	3	12	 A deacon must be  true to his one wife, and rule his children and his own household wisely and well.
29745	54	3	13	 For those who have filled the deacon's office wisely and well, are already gaining for themselves  an honourable standing, and are acquiring great freedom of speech in proclaiming the faith which rests on Christ Jesus.
29746	54	3	14	 All this I write to you, though I am hoping before long to come to see you.
29747	54	3	15	 But, for fear I may be hindered, I now write, so that you may have rules to guide you in dealing with God's household.  For this is what the Church of the  ever-living God is, and it is the pillar and foundation-stone of the truth.
29748	54	3	16	 And, beyond controversy, great is the mystery of our religion--  that Christ appeared in human form, and His claims justified by the Spirit, was seen by angels and proclaimed among Gentile nations, was believed on in the world, and received up again into glory.
29749	54	4	1	 Now  the Spirit expressly declares that in  later times some will fall away from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and the teachings of demons;
29750	54	4	2	 through the hypocrisy of men who teach falsely and have their own consciences seared as with a hot iron;
29751	54	4	3	 forbidding people to marry, and insisting on abstinence from foods which God has created to be partaken of, with thankfulness, by those who believe and have a clear knowledge of the truth.
29752	54	4	4	 For everything that God has created is good, and nothing is to be cast aside, if only it is received with thanksgiving.
29753	54	4	5	 For it is made holy by the word of God and by prayer.
29754	54	4	6	 If you warn the brethren of these dangers you will be a good and faithful servant of Christ Jesus, inwardly feeding on the lessons of the faith and of the sound teaching of which you have been, and are, so close a follower.
29755	54	4	7	 But worldly stories, fit only for credulous old women, have nothing to do with.
29756	54	4	8	 Train yourself in godliness. Exercise for the body is not useless, but godliness is useful in every respect, possessing, as it does, the promise of Life now and of the Life which is soon coming.
29757	54	4	9	 Faithful is this saying and deserving of universal acceptance:
29758	54	4	10	 and here is the motive of our toiling and  wrestling, because  we have our hopes fixed on the  ever-living God, who is the Saviour  of all mankind, and especially of believers.
29759	54	4	11	 Command this and teach this.
29760	54	4	12	 Let no one think slightingly of you because you are a young man; but in speech, conduct, love, faith and purity, be an example for your fellow Christians to imitate.
29761	54	4	13	 Till I come, bestow your attention on  reading, exhortation and teaching.
29762	54	4	14	 Do not be careless about the gifts with which you are endowed, which were conferred on you through a divine revelation when the hands of the elders were placed upon you.
29763	54	4	15	 Habitually practise these duties, and be absorbed in them; so that your growing proficiency in them may be evident to all.
29764	54	4	16	 Be on your guard as to yourself and your teaching. Persevere in these things; for by doing this you will make certain your own salvation and that of your hearers.
29765	54	5	1	 Never administer a sharp reprimand to a man older than yourself; but entreat him as if he were your father, and the younger men as brothers;
29766	54	5	2	 the elder women too as mothers, and the younger women as sisters, with perfect modesty.
29767	54	5	3	 Honour widows who are  really in need.
29768	54	5	4	 But if a widow has children or grandchildren, let these learn  first to show piety towards their own homes and to prove their gratitude to their parents; for this is well pleasing in the sight of God.
29769	54	5	5	 A widow who is  really in need, friendless and desolate,  has her hopes fixed on God, and continues at her supplications and prayers, night and day;
29770	54	5	6	 but a pleasure-loving widow is dead even while still alive.
29771	54	5	7	 Press these facts upon them, so that they may live lives free from reproach.
29772	54	5	8	 But if a man makes no provision for  those dependent on him, and especially for his own family, he has disowned the faith and is behaving worse than an unbeliever.
29773	54	5	9	 No widow is to be put on the roll who is under sixty years of age.
29774	54	5	10	 She must have been  true to her one husband, and well reported of for good deeds, as having brought up children, received strangers hospitably, washed the feet of God's people, given relief to the distressed, and devoted herself to good works of every kind.
29775	54	5	11	 But the younger widows you must not enrol; for as soon as they begin to chafe against the yoke of  Christ, they want to marry,
29776	54	5	12	 and they incur disapproval for having broken their original vow.
29777	54	5	13	 And at the same time they also learn to be idle as they go round from house to house; and they are not only idle, but are gossips also and busybodies, speaking of things that ought not to be spoken of.
29778	54	5	14	 I would therefore have the younger women marry, bear children, rule in domestic matters, and furnish the Adversary with no excuse for slander.
29779	54	5	15	 For already some of them have gone astray, following Satan.
29780	54	5	16	 If a believing woman has widows dependent on her, she should relieve their wants, and save the Church from being burdened--so  that the Church may relieve the widows who are really in need.
29781	54	5	17	 Let the Elders who perform their duties wisely and well be held worthy of double  honour, especially those who labour in  preaching and teaching.
29782	54	5	18	 For the Scripture says, <"You are not to muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain;"> and the workman deserves his pay.
29783	54	5	19	 Never entertain an accusation against an Elder except on the evidence of two of three witnesses.
29784	54	5	20	 Those  who persist in sin reprove in the presence of all, so that it may also be a warning to the rest.
29785	54	5	21	 I solemnly call upon you, in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels, to carry out these instructions of mine without prejudice, and to do nothing from  partiality.
29786	54	5	22	 Do not ordain any one hastily; and do not be a partaker in the sins of others; keep *yourself*  pure.
29787	54	5	23	 (No longer be a water-drinker; but take a little wine for the sake of your digestion and your frequent  ailments.)
29788	54	5	24	 The sins of some men are evident to the world, leading the way to  your estimate of their characters, but the sins of others lag behind.
29789	54	5	25	 So also the right actions of some are evident to the world, and those that are not cannot remain for ever out of sight.
29790	54	6	1	 Let all who are under the yoke of slavery hold their own masters to be deserving of honour, so that the name of God and the Christian teaching may not be spoken against.
29791	54	6	2	 And those who have believing masters should not be wanting in respect towards them because they are their brethren, but should serve them all the more willingly because those who profit by the faithful service rendered are believers and are friends.
29792	54	6	3	 So teach and exhort. If any one is a teacher of any other kind of doctrine, and  refuses assent to wholesome instructions--those of our Lord Jesus Christ--and the teaching that harmonizes with true godliness,
29793	54	6	4	 he is puffed up with pride and has no true knowledge, but is crazy over discussions and controversies about words which give rise to envy, quarrelling, revilings, ill-natured suspicions,
29794	54	6	5	 and persistent wranglings on the part of people whose intellects are disordered and they themselves blinded to all knowledge of the truth; who imagine that godliness means gain.
29795	54	6	6	 And godliness *is* gain, when associated with contentment;
29796	54	6	7	 for we brought nothing into the world, nor can we carry anything out of it;
29797	54	6	8	 and if we have food and clothing, with these we will be satisfied.
29798	54	6	9	 But people who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many unwise and pernicious ways which sink mankind in destruction and ruin.
29799	54	6	10	 For from love of money all sorts of evils arise; and some have so hankered after money as to be led astray from the faith and be pierced through with countless sorrows.
29800	54	6	11	 But you, O man of God, must flee from  these things; and strive for uprightness, godliness,  good faith, love, fortitude, and a forgiving temper.
29801	54	6	12	 Exert all your strength in the honourable  struggle for the faith; lay hold of the Life of the Ages, to which you were called, when you made your noble profession of faith  before many witnesses.
29802	54	6	13	 I charge you--as in the presence of God who gives life to all creatures, and of Christ Jesus who at the bar of Pontius Pilate made a noble profession of faith--
29803	54	6	14	 that you keep God's commandments stainlessly and without reproach till the Appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.
29804	54	6	15	  For, as its appointed time, this will be brought about by the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,
29805	54	6	16	 who alone possesses immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, and whom no man has seen or can see. To Him be eternal honour and power! Amen.
29806	54	6	17	 Impress on those who are rich in the present age that they must not be haughty nor set their hopes on riches--that unstable foundation--but on God who provides us richly with all things for our enjoyment.
29807	54	6	18	 They must be beneficent, rich in noble deeds, open-handed and liberal;
29808	54	6	19	 storing up for themselves that which shall be a solid foundation for  the future, that they may lay hold of the Life which is life indeed.
29809	54	6	20	 O Timothy, guard the truths entrusted to you, shunning irreligious and frivolous talk, and controversy with what is falsely called `knowledge';
29810	54	6	21	 of which some have spoken boastfully  in connexion with the true faith, and have erred. Grace be with  you all.
29811	55	1	1	 Paul, an Apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God, for proclaiming the promise of the Life which is in Christ Jesus:
29812	55	1	2	 To Timothy my dearly-loved child. May grace, mercy and peace be granted to you from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
29813	55	1	3	 I thank God, whom I serve with a pure conscience--as my forefathers did--that night and day I unceasingly remember you in my prayers,
29814	55	1	4	 being always mindful of your tears, and longing to see you that I may be filled with joy.
29815	55	1	5	 For I recall the sincere faith which is in your heart--a faith which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and then in your mother Eunice, and, I am fully convinced, now dwells in you also.
29816	55	1	6	 For this reason let me remind you to rekindle God's gift which is yours through the laying on of my hands.
29817	55	1	7	 For the Spirit which God has given us is not a spirit of cowardice, but one of power and of love and of  sound judgement.
29818	55	1	8	 Do not be ashamed then to bear witness for our Lord and for me His prisoner; but rather share suffering with me in the service of the Good News,  strengthened by the power of God.
29819	55	1	9	 For He saved us and called us with a holy call, not in accordance with our desserts, but in accordance with His own purpose and the free grace which He bestowed on us in Christ Jesus before the commencement of the Ages,
29820	55	1	10	 but which has now been plainly revealed through  the Appearing of our Saviour, Christ Jesus. He has put an end to death and has brought Life and Immortality to light through the Good News,
29821	55	1	11	  of which I have been appointed a preacher, Apostle and  teacher, to the Gentiles.
29822	55	1	12	 That indeed is the reason why I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know in whom my trust reposes, and I am confident that He has it in His power to keep what I have entrusted to Him safe until that day.
29823	55	1	13	  Provide yourself with an  outline of the sound teaching which you have heard from my lips,  and be true to the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.
29824	55	1	14	 That precious treasure which is in your charge, guard through the Holy Spirit who has His home in our hearts.
29825	55	1	15	 Of this you are aware, that all the Christians in Roman Asia have deserted me: and among them Phygelus and Hermogenes.
29826	55	1	16	 May the Lord show mercy to the  household of Onesiphorus; for many a time he cheered me and he was not ashamed of my chain.
29827	55	1	17	 Nay, when he was here in Rome, he took great pains to inquire where I was living, and at last he found me.
29828	55	1	18	 (The Lord grant that he may obtain mercy at His hands on that day!) And you yourself well know all the services which he rendered me in Ephesus.
29829	55	2	1	 You then, my child, must  be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
29830	55	2	2	 All that you have been taught by me in the hearing of many witnesses, you must hand on to trusty men who shall themselves, in turn, be competent to instruct others also.
29831	55	2	3	 As a good soldier of Christ Jesus accept your share of suffering.
29832	55	2	4	 Every one who serves as a soldier keeps himself from becoming entangled in the world's business--so that he may satisfy the officer who enlisted him.
29833	55	2	5	 And if any one takes part in an athletic contest, he gets no prize unless he obeys the rules.
29834	55	2	6	 The harvestman who labours in the field must be the first to get a share of the crop.
29835	55	2	7	 Mark well what I am saying: the Lord will give you discernment in everything.
29836	55	2	8	 Never forget that Jesus Christ has risen from among the dead and is a descendant of David, as is declared in the Good News which I preach.
29837	55	2	9	 For preaching the Good News I suffer, and am even put in chains, as if I were a criminal: yet the word of God is not imprisoned.
29838	55	2	10	 For this reason I endure all things for the sake of God's own people; so that they also may obtain salvation--even the salvation which is in Christ Jesus--and with it eternal glory.
29839	55	2	11	 Faithful is  the saying: "If we died with Him, we shall also live with Him;
29840	55	2	12	 "If we patiently endure pain, we shall also share His Kingship; "If we disown Him, He will also disown us;
29841	55	2	13	 "And even if *our* faith fails, He remains true--He cannot prove false to Himself."
29842	55	2	14	 Bring all this to men's remembrances, solemnly charging them in the presence of  God not to waste time in wrangling about mere words, a course which is altogether unprofitable and tends only to the ruin of the hearers.
29843	55	2	15	 Earnestly seek to commend yourself to God as a servant who, because of his straightforward  dealing with the word of truth, has no reason to feel any shame.
29844	55	2	16	 But from irreligious and frivolous talk hold aloof, for those who indulge in it will proceed from bad to worse in impiety,
29845	55	2	17	 and their teaching will spread like a running sore. Hymenaeus and Philetus are men of that stamp.
29846	55	2	18	 In the matter of the truth they have  gone astray, saying that the Resurrection  is already past, and so they are overthrowing the faith of some.
29847	55	2	19	 Yet God's solid foundation stands unmoved, bearing this inscription, <"The Lord knows those who really belong to Him."> And this also, <"Let every one who names the Name of the Lord renounce all wickedness.">
29848	55	2	20	 Now in a great house there are not only articles of gold and silver, but also others of wood and of earthenware; and some are for specially honourable, and others for common use.
29849	55	2	21	 If therefore a man keeps himself clear of these latter, he himself will be for specially honourable use, consecrated, fit for the Master's service, and fully equipped for every good work.
29850	55	2	22	 Keep a strong curb, however, on your youthful cravings; and strive for integrity, good faith, love, peace, in company with all who pray to the Lord with pure hearts.
29851	55	2	23	 But  avoid foolish discussions with ignorant men, knowing--as you do--that these lead to quarrels;
29852	55	2	24	 and a bondservant of the Lord must not quarrel, but must be inoffensive towards all men, a skilful teacher, and patient under wrongs.
29853	55	2	25	 He must speak in a gentle tone when correcting the errors of opponents, in the hope that God will at last give them repentance, for them to come to a full knowledge of the truth
29854	55	2	26	 and recover sober-mindedness and freedom from the Devil's snare,  though they are now entrapped by him to do his will.
29855	55	3	1	 But of this be assured: in  the last days grievous times will set in.
29856	55	3	2	 For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, profane. They will be disobedient to parents, thankless, irreligious,
29857	55	3	3	 destitute of natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers. They will have no self-control, but will be brutal, opposed  to goodness,
29858	55	3	4	 treacherous, headstrong, self-important. They will love pleasure instead of loving God,
29859	55	3	5	 and will keep up a make-believe of piety and yet live in defiance of its power. Turn away from people of this sort.
29860	55	3	6	 Among them are included the men who make their way into private houses and carry off weak women as their prisoners--women who, weighed down by the burden of their sins, are led by ever-changing caprice,
29861	55	3	7	 and are always learning something new, and yet are never able to arrive at real knowledge of the truth.
29862	55	3	8	 And just as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so also these false teachers withstand the truth--being, as they are, men of debased intellects, and of no real worth so far as faith is concerned.
29863	55	3	9	 But they will have no further success; for their folly will be as clearly manifest to all men, as that of the opponents of Moses came to be.
29864	55	3	10	 But you have  intimately known my teaching, life, aims, faith, patience, love, resignation,
29865	55	3	11	 and the persecutions and sufferings which I have endured; the things which happened to me in Antioch, Iconium and Lystra. You know the persecutions I endured, and how the Lord delivered me out of them all.
29866	55	3	12	 And indeed every one who is determined to live a godly life  as a follower of Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
29867	55	3	13	 But bad men and impostors will go on from bad to worse, misleading and being misled.
29868	55	3	14	 But you must cling to the things which you have learnt and have been taught to believe, knowing who your teachers were,
29869	55	3	15	  and that from infancy you have known the sacred writings which are able to  make you wise to obtain salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
29870	55	3	16	  Every  Scripture  is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for convincing, for correction of error, and for instruction in right doing;
29871	55	3	17	 so that the man of God may himself be complete and may be perfectly equipped for every good work.
29872	55	4	1	 I solemnly implore you, in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus who is about to judge the living and the dead, and by His Appearing and His Kingship:
29873	55	4	2	 proclaim God's message, be zealous in season and out of season; convince, rebuke, encourage, with the utmost patience as a teacher.
29874	55	4	3	 For a time is coming when they will not tolerate wholesome instruction, but, wanting to have their ears tickled, they will find a multitude of teachers to satisfy their own fancies;
29875	55	4	4	 and will turn away from listening to the truth and will turn aside to fables.
29876	55	4	5	 But as for you, you must exercise habitual self-control, and not live a self-indulgent life, but do the duty of an evangelist and fully discharge the obligations of your office.
29877	55	4	6	 I for my part am like a  drink-offering which is already being poured out; and the time for my departure is now close at hand.
29878	55	4	7	 I have  gone through the glorious contest; I have run the race; I have guarded the faith.
29879	55	4	8	 From this time onward there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day, and not only to me, but also to all who love the thought of His Appearing.
29880	55	4	9	 Make an effort to come to me speedily.
29881	55	4	10	 For Demas has deserted me--loving, as he does,  the present age--and has gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.
29882	55	4	11	 Luke is the only friend I now have with me. Call for Mark on your way and bring him with you, for he is a great help to me in my ministry.
29883	55	4	12	 Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.
29884	55	4	13	  When you come, bring with you the cloak which I left behind at Troas at the house of Carpus, and the books, but especially the parchments.
29885	55	4	14	 Alexander the  metal-worker showed bitter hostility towards me: the Lord will requite him according to his doings.
29886	55	4	15	 You also should beware of him; for he has violently opposed our preaching.
29887	55	4	16	 At my first defence I had no one at my side, but all deserted me. May it not be laid to their charge.
29888	55	4	17	 The Lord, however, stood by me and filled me with inward strength, that through me the Message might be fully proclaimed and that all the Gentiles might hear it; and I was rescued  from the lion's jaws.
29889	55	4	18	 The Lord will deliver me from every cruel attack and will keep me safe in preparation for His heavenly Kingdom. To Him be the glory until the Ages of the Ages! Amen.
29890	55	4	19	 Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
29891	55	4	20	 Erastus stayed in Corinth; Trophimus I left behind me at Miletus, ill.
29892	55	4	21	 Make an effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brethren.
29893	55	4	22	 The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you all.
29894	56	1	1	 Paul, a bondservant of God and an Apostle of Jesus Christ for building up the faith of God's own people and spreading a full knowledge of the truths of religion,
29895	56	1	2	 in hope of the Life of the Ages which God, who is never false to His word, promised before the commencement of the Ages.
29896	56	1	3	 And at the appointed time He clearly made known His Message in the preaching with which I was entrusted by the command of God our Saviour:
29897	56	1	4	 To Titus my own true child in  our common faith. May grace and peace be granted to you from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.
29898	56	1	5	 I have left you behind in Crete in order that you may set right the things which still require attention, and appoint Elders in every town, as I directed you to do;
29899	56	1	6	 wherever there is a man of blameless life,  true to his one wife, having children who are themselves believers and are free from every reproach of profligacy or of stubborn self-will.
29900	56	1	7	 For, as God's steward,  a minister must be of blameless life, not over-fond of having his own way, not a man of a passionate temper nor a hard drinker, not given to blows nor greedy of gain,
29901	56	1	8	 but hospitable to strangers, a lover  of goodness, sober-minded, upright, saintly, self-controlled;
29902	56	1	9	 holding fast to the faithful Message  which he has received, so that he may be well qualified both to encourage others with sound teaching and to reply successfully to opponents.
29903	56	1	10	 For there are many that spurn authority--idle, talkative and deceitful persons, who, for the most part, are adherents of the Circumcision.
29904	56	1	11	 You must stop the mouths of such men, for they overthrow the faith of whole families, teaching what they ought not, just for the sake of making money.
29905	56	1	12	 One of their own number--a Prophet who is a countryman of theirs--has said, "Cretans are always liars, dangerous animals, idle gluttons."
29906	56	1	13	 This testimony is true. Therefore sternly denounce them, that they may be robust in their faith,
29907	56	1	14	 and not give attention to Jewish legends and the  maxims of men who turn their backs on the truth.
29908	56	1	15	 To the pure everything is pure; but to the polluted and unbelieving nothing is pure, but on the contrary their very minds and consciences are polluted.
29909	56	1	16	 They profess to know God; but in their actions they disown Him, and are detestable and disobedient men, and for any good work are utterly useless.
29910	56	2	1	 But as for you, you must speak in a manner that befits wholesome teaching.
29911	56	2	2	 Exhort aged men to be temperate, grave, sober-minded, robust in their faith, their love and their patience.
29912	56	2	3	 In the same way exhort aged women to let their conduct be such as becomes consecrated persons. They must not be slanderers nor enslaved to wine-drinking. They must be teachers of what is right.
29913	56	2	4	 They should school the young women to be  affectionate to their husbands and to their children, to be sober-minded, pure in their lives,
29914	56	2	5	 industrious in their homes, kind, submissive to their husbands, so that the Christian teaching may not be exposed to reproach.
29915	56	2	6	 In the same way exhort the younger men to be discreet,
29916	56	2	7	 and above all make your own life a pattern of right conduct, having in your teaching no taint of insincerity, but a serious tone,
29917	56	2	8	 and healthy language which no one can censure, so that our opponents may feel ashamed at having nothing evil to say against us.
29918	56	2	9	 Exhort slaves to be always obedient to their owners, and to give them satisfaction in everything, not contradicting and not pilfering,
29919	56	2	10	 but manifesting perfect fidelity and kind feeling, in order to bring honour to the teaching of our Saviour, God, in all things.
29920	56	2	11	 For the grace of God has displayed itself with healing power to all mankind,
29921	56	2	12	 training us to renounce ungodliness and all the pleasures of this world, and to live sober, upright, and pious lives at the present time,
29922	56	2	13	 in expectation of the fulfilment of our blessed hope--the  Appearing in glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ;
29923	56	2	14	 who gave Himself for us to purchase our freedom from all iniquity, and purify for Himself a people who should be  specially His own, zealous for doing good works.
29924	56	2	15	 Thus speak, exhort, reprove, with all impressiveness. Let no one make light of your authority.
29925	56	3	1	 Remind people that they must submit to the rulers who are in authority over them; that they must obey the magistrates, be prepared for every right action,
29926	56	3	2	 not speak evil of any one, nor be contentious, but yield unselfishly to others and constantly manifest a forgiving spirit towards all men.
29927	56	3	3	 For there was a time when we also were deficient in understanding, obstinate, deluded, the slaves of various cravings and pleasures, spending our lives in malice and envy, hateful ourselves and hating one another.
29928	56	3	4	 But when the goodness of God our Saviour, and His love to man,  dawned upon us, not in consequence of things which we,
29929	56	3	5	 as righteous men, had done, but as the result of His own mercy He saved us by means of the bath of regeneration and the renewal of our natures by the Holy Spirit,
29930	56	3	6	 which He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
29931	56	3	7	 in order that having been declared righteous through His grace we might become heirs to the Life of the Ages in fulfilment of our hopes.
29932	56	3	8	 This is a faithful saying, and on these various points I would have you insist strenuously, in order that those who have their faith fixed on God may be careful to set an example of good actions. For these are not only good in themselves, but are also useful to mankind.
29933	56	3	9	 But hold yourself aloof from foolish controversies and  pedigrees and discussions and wrangling about the Law, for they are useless and vain.
29934	56	3	10	 After a first and second admonition, have nothing further to do with any one  who will not be taught;
29935	56	3	11	 for, as you know, a man of that description has turned aside from the right path and is a sinner self-condemned.
29936	56	3	12	 After I have sent Artemas or Tychicus to you, lose no time in joining me at Nicopolis; for I have decided to pass the winter there.
29937	56	3	13	 Help Zenas the lawyer forward on his journey with special care, and Apollos, so that they may have all they require.
29938	56	3	14	 And let our people too learn to set a good example in following honest occupations for the supply of their necessities, so that they may not live useless lives.
29939	56	3	15	 Every one here sends you greeting. Greet the believers who hold us dear. May grace be with you all.
29940	57	1	1	 Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother: To Philemon our dearly-loved fellow labourer--
29941	57	1	2	 and to our sister Apphia and our comrade Archippus--as well as to the  Church in your house.
29942	57	1	3	  May grace be granted to you all, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
29943	57	1	4	 I give continual thanks to my God while making mention of you, my brother, in my prayers,
29944	57	1	5	 because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have towards the Lord Jesus and which you manifest towards all God's people;
29945	57	1	6	 praying as I do, that their participation in your faith may result in others fully recognizing all the right affection that is in us toward Christ.
29946	57	1	7	 For I have  found great  joy and comfort in your love, because the  hearts of God's people have been, and are, refreshed through you, my brother.
29947	57	1	8	 Therefore,  though I might with Christ's authority speak very freely and order you to do what is fitting,
29948	57	1	9	 it is for love's sake that--instead of that--although I am none other than Paul the aged, and am now also a prisoner for Christ Jesus,
29949	57	1	10	 I entreat you on behalf of my own child whose father I have become while in my chains--I mean Onesimus.
29950	57	1	11	 Formerly he was useless to you, but now--true to his name--he is of great use to you and to me.
29951	57	1	12	 I  am sending him back to you, though in so doing I send part of myself.
29952	57	1	13	 It was my wish to keep him at my side for him to attend to my wants, as your representative, during my imprisonment for the Good News.
29953	57	1	14	 Only I wished to do nothing without your consent, so that his kind action of yours might not be done under pressure, but might be a voluntary one.
29954	57	1	15	 For perhaps it was  for this reason he was parted from you for a time, that you might receive him back wholly and for ever yours;
29955	57	1	16	 no longer as a slave, but as something better than a slave--a brother peculiarly dear to me, and even dearer to you, both as a servant and as a fellow Christian.
29956	57	1	17	 If therefore you regard me as a comrade, receive him as if he were I myself.
29957	57	1	18	 And if he was ever dishonest or is in your debt,  debit me with the amount.
29958	57	1	19	 I Paul write this with my own hand--I will pay you in full. (I say nothing of the fact that you owe me even your own self.)
29959	57	1	20	 Yes, brother, do me this favour for the Lord's sake. Refresh my heart in Christ.
29960	57	1	21	 I write to you in the full confidence that you will meet my wishes, for I know you will do even more than I say.
29961	57	1	22	 And at the same time provide accommodation for me; for I hope that through your prayers I shall be permitted to come to you.
29962	57	1	23	 Greetings to you, my brother, from Epaphras my fellow prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus;
29963	57	1	24	 and from Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
29964	57	1	25	 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with the spirit of  every one of you.
29965	58	1	1	 God, who in ancient days spoke to our forefathers in many distinct messages and by various methods  through the Prophets,
29966	58	1	2	 has  at the end of these days spoken to us  through a Son, who is the pre-destined Lord of the universe, and through whom He made the Ages.
29967	58	1	3	 He brightly reflects God's glory and is the exact representation of His  being, and upholds the universe by His all-powerful word. After securing  man's purification from sin He took His seat at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
29968	58	1	4	 having become as far superior to the angels as the Name He possesses by inheritance is more excellent than theirs.
29969	58	1	5	 For to which of the angels did God ever say, <"My Son art Thou: I have this day become Thy Father;"> and again, <"I will be a Father to Him, and He shall be My Son"?>
29970	58	1	6	 But speaking of the time when He  once more brings His Firstborn into the world, He says, <"And let all God's angels worship Him.">
29971	58	1	7	 Moreover of the angels He says,  <"He changes His angels into winds, and His ministering servants into a flame of fire.">
29972	58	1	8	 But of His Son, He says, <"Thy throne, O God,  is for ever and for ever, and the sceptre of Thy Kingdom is  a sceptre of absolute justice.
29973	58	1	9	 Thou hast loved righteousness and hated lawlessness;  therefore God, Thy God, has anointed Thee with the oil of gladness beyond  Thy companions.">
29974	58	1	10	 It is also of His Son that God says, <"Thou, O Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Thy hands.
29975	58	1	11	 The heavens will perish, but Thou remainest; and they will all grow old like a garment,
29976	58	1	12	 and,  as though they were a mantle Thou wilt roll them up; yes, like a garment, and they will undergo change. But Thou art the same, and Thy years will never come to an end.">
29977	58	1	13	 To which of the angels has He ever said, <"Sit at My right hand till I make Thy foes a footstool for Thy feet"?>
29978	58	1	14	 Are not all angels spirits that serve Him--whom He sends out to render service for the benefit of those who, before long, will inherit salvation?
29979	58	2	1	 For this reason we ought to pay the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, for fear we should  drift away from them.
29980	58	2	2	 For if the message delivered through angels proved to be true, and every transgression and act of disobedience met with just retribution,
29981	58	2	3	 how shall *we* escape  if we are indifferent to a salvation as great as that now offered to us? This, after having first of all been announced by the Lord Himself, had its truth made sure to us by those who heard Him,
29982	58	2	4	 while God corroborated their testimony by signs and marvels and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed in accordance with His own will.
29983	58	2	5	 It is not to angels that God has assigned the sovereignty of that coming  world, of which we speak.
29984	58	2	6	 But,  as we know, a writer has solemnly said, <"How poor a creature is man, and yet Thou dost remember him, and a son of man, and yet Thou dost come to him!
29985	58	2	7	 Thou hast made him only  a little inferior to the angels; with glory and honour Thou hast crowned him,  and hast set him to govern the works of Thy hands.
29986	58	2	8	 Thou hast put everything in subjection under his feet."> For this subjecting of the universe to man implies the leaving nothing not subject to him. But we do not as yet see the universe subject to him.
29987	58	2	9	 But Jesus--who was made a little inferior to the angels in order that  through God's grace He might taste death for every human being--we already see wearing a crown of glory and honour because of His having suffered death.
29988	58	2	10	 For it was fitting that He for whom, and through whom, all things exist, after He had brought  many sons to glory, should perfect by suffering the Prince Leader who had saved them.
29989	58	2	11	 For both He who sanctifies and those whom He is sanctifying have all one Father; and for this reason He is not ashamed to speak of them as His brothers;
29990	58	2	12	 as when He says: <"I will proclaim Thy name to My brothers:  in the midst of the congregation I will hymn Thy praises;">
29991	58	2	13	 and again, <"As for Me, I will be one whose trust reposes in God;"> and again, <"Here am I, and here are the children God has given Me.">
29992	58	2	14	 Since then the children referred to are all alike sharers in  perishable human nature, He Himself also, in the same way, took on Him a share of it, in order that through death He might render powerless him who had authority over death, that is, the Devil,
29993	58	2	15	 and might set at liberty all those who through fear of death had been subject to lifelong slavery.
29994	58	2	16	 For assuredly it is not to angels that He is continually reaching a helping hand, but it is to the descendants of Abraham.
29995	58	2	17	 And for this purpose it was necessary that in all respects He should be made to resemble His brothers, so that He might become a compassionate and faithful High Priest in things relating to God, in order to atone for the sins of the people.
29996	58	2	18	 For inasmuch as He has Himself felt the pain of  temptation and trial, He is also able instantly to help those who are tempted and tried.
29997	58	3	1	 Therefore, holy brethren, sharers with others in a heavenly invitation, fix your thoughts on Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest whose followers we profess to be.
29998	58	3	2	 How faithful He was to Him who appointed Him,  just as Moses also was faithful in all God's house!
29999	58	3	3	 For Jesus has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, in so far as  he who has built a house has higher honour than the house itself.
30000	58	3	4	 For every house has had a builder, and the builder of all things is God.
30001	58	3	5	 Moreover, Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant in delivering the message given him to speak;
30002	58	3	6	 but Christ was faithful as a Son having authority over God's house, and we are that house, if we hold firm to  the End the boldness and the  hope which we boast of as ours.
30003	58	3	7	 For this reason--as the Holy Spirit warns us,  <"To-day, if you hear His voice,
30004	58	3	8	 do not harden your hearts as your forefathers did in the time of the  provocation on the day of the  temptation in the Desert,
30005	58	3	9	 where your forefathers so sorely tried My patience and saw all that I did during forty years.
30006	58	3	10	 Therefore I was greatly grieved with that generation, and I said, `They are ever going astray in heart, and have not learnt to know My paths.'
30007	58	3	11	 As I swore in My anger, they shall not be admitted to My rest" -->
30008	58	3	12	 see to it, brethren, that there is never in any one of you--as perhaps there may be--a sinful and unbelieving heart, manifesting itself in revolt from the ever-living God.
30009	58	3	13	 On the contrary  encourage  one another, day after day,  so long as To-day lasts, so that not one of you may be hardened through the deceitful character of  sin.
30010	58	3	14	 For we have, all alike, become sharers with Christ, if we really hold our first confidence firm to the End;
30011	58	3	15	 seeing that the warning still comes to us, <"To-day, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as your forefathers did in the time of the provocation.">
30012	58	3	16	 For who were they  that heard, and yet provoked God? Was it not  the whole of the people who had come out of Egypt under the leadership of Moses?
30013	58	3	17	 And with whom was God so greatly grieved for forty years? Was it not with those who had sinned, and whose  dead bodies fell in the Desert?
30014	58	3	18	 And to whom did He swear that they should not be admitted to His rest, if it was not to those who were disobedient?
30015	58	3	19	 And so we see that it was owing to lack of faith that they could not be admitted.
30016	58	4	1	  Therefore let us be on our guard lest perhaps, while He still leaves us a promise of being admitted to His rest, some one of you should be found to have fallen short of it.
30017	58	4	2	 For  Good News has been brought to us as truly as to them; but the message they heard failed to benefit them, because they were not one in faith with  those who gave heed to it.
30018	58	4	3	 We who have believed are soon to be admitted to  the true rest; as He has said, <"As I swore in My anger, they shall not be admitted to My rest,"> although God's works had been going on ever since the creation of the world.
30019	58	4	4	 For, as we know, when speaking of the seventh day He has used the words, <"And God rested on the seventh day from all His works;">
30020	58	4	5	 and He has also declared, <"They shall not be admitted to My rest.">
30021	58	4	6	 Since, then, it is still true that some will be admitted to that rest, and that because of disobedience those  who formerly had Good News proclaimed to them were not admitted,
30022	58	4	7	 He again definitely mentions a certain day, "To-day," saying long afterwards, by David's lips, in the words already quoted, <"To-day, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.">
30023	58	4	8	 For if Joshua had given them the true rest,  we should not afterwards hear God speaking of another still future day.
30024	58	4	9	 It follows that there still remains a sabbath rest for the people of God.
30025	58	4	10	 For  He who has been admitted to His rest, has rested from His works as God did from His.
30026	58	4	11	 Let it then be our earnest endeavour to be admitted to that rest, so that no one may perish through following the same example of unbelief.
30027	58	4	12	 For  God's Message is full of life and power, and is keener than  the sharpest two-edged sword. It pierces even to the severance of soul from spirit, and penetrates between the joints and the marrow, and it can discern the secret thoughts and purposes of the heart.
30028	58	4	13	 And no created thing is able to escape its scrutiny; but everything lies bare and  completely exposed before the eyes of Him  with whom we have to do.
30029	58	4	14	 Inasmuch, then, as we have in Jesus, the Son of God, a great High Priest who has passed  into Heaven itself, let us hold firmly to our profession of faith.
30030	58	4	15	 For we have not a High Priest who is unable to feel for us in our weaknesses, but one who was tempted in every respect just as we are tempted, and yet did not sin.
30031	58	4	16	 Therefore let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our times of need.
30032	58	5	1	 For every  High Priest is chosen from among men, and is appointed to act on behalf of men in matters relating to God, in order to offer both  gifts and sin-offerings,
30033	58	5	2	 and must be one who is able to bear patiently with the ignorant and erring, because he himself also is beset with infirmity.
30034	58	5	3	 And for this reason he is required to offer sin-offerings not only for the people but also for himself.
30035	58	5	4	 And no one takes this  honourable office upon himself, but only accepts it when called to it by God, as Aaron was.
30036	58	5	5	 So Christ also did not claim for Himself the honour of being made High Priest, but was appointed to it by Him who said to Him, <"My Son art Thou: I have to-day become Thy Father;">
30037	58	5	6	 as also in another passage He says, <"Thou art a priest for ever, belonging to the order of Melchizedek.">
30038	58	5	7	 For Jesus during his earthly life offered up prayers and entreaties, crying aloud and weeping as He pleaded with Him who was able to bring Him in safety out of death, and He was delivered  from the terror from which He shrank.
30039	58	5	8	 Although He was God's Son, yet He learned obedience from the sufferings which He endured;
30040	58	5	9	 and so, having been  made perfect, He became to all who obey Him the  source and giver of eternal salvation.
30041	58	5	10	 For God Himself  addresses Him as a High Priest for ever, belonging to the order of Melchizedek.
30042	58	5	11	 Concerning Him we have much to say, and much that it would be difficult to make clear to you, since you have become  so dull of apprehension.
30043	58	5	12	 For although, considering the long time you have been believers, you ought now to be teachers of others, you really need some one to teach you over again the very rudiments of the truths of God, and you have come to require milk instead of solid food.
30044	58	5	13	 By people who live on milk I mean those who are imperfectly acquainted with the  teaching concerning righteousness.
30045	58	5	14	 Such persons are mere babes. But solid food  is for adults--that is, for those who through constant practice have their spiritual faculties carefully trained to distinguish good from evil.
30046	58	6	1	 Therefore leaving elementary instruction about the Christ, let us advance to mature manhood and not be continually re-laying a foundation of repentance from  lifeless works and of  faith in God,
30047	58	6	2	 or of teaching about  ceremonial washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection  of the dead, and  the last judgement.
30048	58	6	3	 And advance we will, if God permits us to do so.
30049	58	6	4	 For it is impossible, in the case of those who have once for all been enlightened, and have tasted the sweetness of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,
30050	58	6	5	 and have realized how good the word of God is and how mighty are the powers of the coming Age, and then fell away--
30051	58	6	6	 it is impossible, I say, to keep bringing them back to a new repentance, for,  to their own undoing, they are repeatedly crucifying the Son of God afresh and exposing Him to open shame.
30052	58	6	7	 For land which has drunk in the rain that often falls upon it, and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sakes, indeed, it is tilled, has a share in God's blessing.
30053	58	6	8	 But if it only yields a mass of thorns and briers, it is considered worthless, and is in danger of being cursed, and in the end will be destroyed by fire.
30054	58	6	9	 But we, even while we speak in this tone, have a happier conviction concerning you, my dearly-loved friends--a conviction of things which point towards salvation.
30055	58	6	10	 For God is not unjust so that He is unmindful of your labour and of the love which you have manifested towards Himself in having rendered services to His people and in still rendering them.
30056	58	6	11	 But we long for each of you to continue to manifest the same earnestness, with a view to your enjoying fulness of hope to the very End;
30057	58	6	12	 so that you may not  become half-hearted, but be imitators of those who through faith and patient endurance are now heirs to the promises.
30058	58	6	13	 For when God gave the promise to Abraham, since He had no one greater to swear by, He swore by Himself,
30059	58	6	14	 saying, <"Assuredly I will bless you and bless you, I will increase you and increase you.">
30060	58	6	15	 And so, as the result of patient waiting, our forefather obtained what God had promised.
30061	58	6	16	 For men swear by what is greater than themselves; and with them an oath in confirmation of a statement always puts an end to a dispute.
30062	58	6	17	 In the same way, since it was God's desire to display more convincingly to the heirs of the promise how unchangeable His purpose was,
30063	58	6	18	 He added an oath, in order that, through  two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for Him to prove false, we may possess mighty encouragement--we who, for safety, have hastened to lay hold of the hope set before us.
30064	58	6	19	 That hope we have as an anchor of the soul--an anchor that can neither break nor drag. It passes in behind the veil,
30065	58	6	20	 where Jesus has entered as  a forerunner  on our behalf, having become, like Melchizedek, a High Priest for ever.
30066	58	7	1	 For this man, Melchizedek, King of Salem and priest of the Most High God--he who when Abraham was returning after defeating the kings met him and pronounced a blessing on him--
30067	58	7	2	 to whom also Abraham presented a tenth part of all--being first, as his name signifies, King of righteousness, and secondly King of Salem, that is, King of peace:
30068	58	7	3	  with no father or mother, and no record of ancestry: having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made a type of the Son of God--this man Melchizedek remains a priest for ever.
30069	58	7	4	 Now think how great this priest-king must have been to whom Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth part of the best of the spoil.
30070	58	7	5	 And those of the descendants of Levi who receive the priesthood are authorized by the Law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brethren, though these have sprung from Abraham.
30071	58	7	6	 But, in this instance, one who does not trace his origin from them takes tithes from Abraham, and pronounces a blessing on him to whom the promises belong.
30072	58	7	7	 And beyond all dispute it is always the inferior who is blessed by the superior.
30073	58	7	8	 Moreover  here frail mortal men receive tithes: there one receives them about whom there is evidence that he is alive.
30074	58	7	9	 And Levi too--if I may so speak--pays tithes through Abraham:
30075	58	7	10	 for Levi was yet in the loins of his forefather when Melchizedek met Abraham.
30076	58	7	11	 Now if  the crowning blessing was attainable by means of the Levitical priesthood--for  as resting on this foundation the people received the Law,  to which they are still subject--  what further need was there for a Priest of a different kind to be raised up belonging to the order of Melchizedek instead of being said to belong to the order of Aaron?
30077	58	7	12	 For when the priesthood changes, a change of Law also of necessity takes place.
30078	58	7	13	  He, however, to whom that prophecy refers  is associated with a different tribe, not one member of which has anything to do with the altar.
30079	58	7	14	 For it is undeniable that our Lord sprang from Judah, a tribe of which Moses said nothing in connection with priests.
30080	58	7	15	  And this is still more abundantly clear when we read that it is as belonging to the order of Melchizedek that a priest of a different kind is to arise,
30081	58	7	16	 and hold His office not in obedience to any temporary Law, but by virtue of an indestructible Life.
30082	58	7	17	 For the words are in evidence, <"Thou art a priest for ever, belonging to the order of Melchizedek.">
30083	58	7	18	 On the one hand we have here the abrogation of an earlier code because it was weak and ineffective--
30084	58	7	19	 for the Law brought no perfect blessing--but on the other hand we have the bringing in of a new and better hope by means of which we draw near to God.
30085	58	7	20	 And since  it was not without an oath being taken--
30086	58	7	21	 for these men hold office without any oath having been taken, but He holds it attested by an oath from Him who said to Him, <"The Lord has sworn and will not  recall His words, Thou art a Priest for ever" -->
30087	58	7	22	 so much the more also is the Covenant of which Jesus has become the  guarantor, a better covenant.
30088	58	7	23	 And they have been appointed priests many in number, because death prevents their continuance in office:
30089	58	7	24	 but He, because He continues for ever, has a priesthood which does not pass to any successor.
30090	58	7	25	 Hence too He is able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, seeing that He ever lives to plead for them.
30091	58	7	26	 Moreover we needed just such a High Priest as this--holy, guileless, undefiled, far removed from sinful men and exalted above the heavens;
30092	58	7	27	 who, unlike other High Priests, is not under the necessity of offering up sacrifices day after day, first for His own sins, and afterwards for those of the people; for this latter thing He did once for all when He offered up Himself.
30093	58	7	28	 For the Law constitutes men High Priests--men with all their infirmity--but the utterance of the oath, which came later than the Law, constitutes High Priest a Son who has been made for ever perfect.
30094	58	8	1	 Now in connexion with what we have been saying the chief point is that we have a High Priest who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of God's Majesty in the heavens,
30095	58	8	2	 and ministers in the Holy place and in the true tabernacle which not man, but the Lord pitched.
30096	58	8	3	 Every High Priest,  however, is appointed to offer both bloodless gifts and sacrifices. Therefore this High Priest also must have some offering to present.
30097	58	8	4	 If then He were still on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since  here there are already those who present the offerings in obedience to the Law,
30098	58	8	5	 and serve a copy and type of the heavenly things, just as Moses was divinely instructed when about to build the tabernacle. For God said, <"See that you make everything in imitation of the pattern shown you on the mountain.">
30099	58	8	6	 But, as a matter of fact, the ministry which Christ has obtained is all the nobler a ministry, in that He is at the same time the negotiator of a sublimer covenant, based upon sublimer promises.
30100	58	8	7	 For if that first Covenant had been free from imperfection, there would have been no attempt to introduce another.
30101	58	8	8	 For, being dissatisfied with His people, God says, <"`There are days coming,' says the Lord, `When I will establish with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new Covenant--
30102	58	8	9	 a Covenant unlike the one which I made with their forefathers on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out from the land of Egypt; for they would not remain faithful to  that.' `So I turned from them,' says the Lord.
30103	58	8	10	 `But this is the Covenant that I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days,' says the Lord: I will put My laws into their minds and will write them upon their hearts. And I will indeed be their God and they shall be My People.
30104	58	8	11	 And there shall be no need for them to teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother, saying, Know the Lord. For all will know Me from the least of them to the greatest;
30105	58	8	12	 Because I will be merciful to their wrongdoings, and their sins I will remember no longer.'">
30106	58	8	13	 By using the words, "a new Covenant," He has made the first one obsolete; but whatever is decaying and showing signs of old age is not far from disappearing altogether.
30107	58	9	1	 Now even  the first Covenant had regulations for divine worship, and had also its sanctuary--a sanctuary belonging to this world.
30108	58	9	2	 For a sacred tent was constructed--the  outer one, in which were the lamp and the table and  the presented loaves; and this is called  the Holy place.
30109	58	9	3	 And behind the second veil was a sacred tent called the  Holy of holies.
30110	58	9	4	 This had a  censer of gold, and the ark of the Covenant lined with gold and completely covered with gold, and in it were a gold vase which held the manna, and Aaron's rod which budded and the tables of the Covenant.
30111	58	9	5	 And above the ark were the Cherubim  denoting God's glorious presence and overshadowing the Mercy-seat. But I cannot now speak about all these in detail.
30112	58	9	6	 These arrangements having long been completed, the priests, when conducting the divine services, continually enter the outer tent.
30113	58	9	7	 But into the second, the High Priest goes only on one day of the year, and goes alone, taking with him blood, which he offers on his own behalf and on account of the sins which the people have ignorantly committed.
30114	58	9	8	 And the lesson which the Holy Spirit teaches is this--that the way into the  true  Holy place is not yet open  so long as the outer tent still remains in existence.
30115	58	9	9	 And this is a figure--for the time now present--answering to which both gifts and sacrifices are offered, unable though they are to give complete freedom from sin to him who ministers.
30116	58	9	10	 For their efficacy depends only on meats and drinks and various washings, ceremonies pertaining to the body and imposed until a time of reformation.
30117	58	9	11	 But Christ  appeared as a High Priest of the blessings  that are soon to come by means of the greater and more perfect Tent of worship, a tent which has not been built with hands--that is to say does not belong to this material creation--
30118	58	9	12	 and once for all entered  the Holy place, taking with Him not the blood of goats and calves, but His own blood, and thus procuring eternal redemption for us.
30119	58	9	13	 For if  the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have contracted defilement make them holy so as to bring about  ceremonial purity,
30120	58	9	14	 how much more certainly shall the blood of Christ, who  strengthened by  the eternal Spirit  offered Himself to God, free from blemish, purify  your consciences from  lifeless works for you to  serve the  ever-living God?
30121	58	9	15	  And because of this He is the negotiator of a new Covenant, in order that, since a life has been given in atonement for the offences committed under the first Covenant, those who have been called may receive the eternal inheritance which has been promised to them.
30122	58	9	16	 For where there is a  legal `will,' there must also be a death brought forward in evidence--the death of him who made it.
30123	58	9	17	 And a will is only of force in the case of a deceased person, being never of any avail so long as he who made it lives.
30124	58	9	18	 Accordingly  we find that the first Covenant was not inaugurated without blood.
30125	58	9	19	 For when Moses had proclaimed  to all the people  every commandment contained in the Law, he took the blood of the calves and of the goats and with them water, scarlet wool and hyssop, and  sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
30126	58	9	20	 saying, <"This is the blood which confirms the Covenant that God has made binding upon you.">
30127	58	9	21	 And in the same way  he also sprinkled blood upon the Tent of worship and upon all the vessels used in the ministry.
30128	58	9	22	 Indeed we may almost say that in obedience to the Law everything is sprinkled with blood, and that apart from  the outpouring of blood there is no remission of sins.
30129	58	9	23	 It was needful therefore that the copies of the things in Heaven should be cleansed in this way, but that the heavenly things themselves should be cleansed with more costly sacrifices.
30130	58	9	24	 For not into a  Holy place built by men's hands--a mere copy of the reality--did Christ enter, but He entered Heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.
30131	58	9	25	 Nor did He enter for the purpose of many times offering Himself in sacrifice, just as the High Priest enters the  Holy place, year after year, taking with him blood not his own.
30132	58	9	26	 In that case Christ would have needed to suffer many times, from the creation of the world onwards; but as a matter of fact He has appeared once for all, at  the Close of the Ages, in order to do away with sin by  the sacrifice of Himself.
30133	58	9	27	 And since it is reserved for all mankind once to die, and afterwards to be judged;
30134	58	9	28	 so the Christ also, having been once offered in sacrifice in order that He might bear the sins of  many, will appear a second time,  separated from sin,  to those who are eagerly expecting Him, to make their salvation complete.
30135	58	10	1	 For, since the Law exhibits only an outline of the blessings to come and not a perfect representation of the things themselves,  the priests can never, by repeating the same sacrifices which they continually offer year after year, give complete freedom from sin to those who draw near.
30136	58	10	2	 For then would not the sacrifices have ceased to be offered, because the consciences of the worshippers--who in that case would now have been cleansed once for all--would no longer be burdened with sins?
30137	58	10	3	 But in those sacrifices sins are recalled to memory year after year.
30138	58	10	4	 For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
30139	58	10	5	 That is why, when He comes into the world, He says, <"Sacrifice and offering Thou has not desired, but a body Thou hast prepared for Me.
30140	58	10	6	 In whole burnt-offerings and in sin-offerings Thou hast taken no pleasure.
30141	58	10	7	 Then I said, `I have come--in the roll of the book it is written concerning Me--to do Thy will, O God.'">
30142	58	10	8	 After saying the words I have just quoted, <"Sacrifices and offerings or whole burnt-offerings and sin-offerings Thou hast not desired or taken pleasure in"> --all such being offered in obedience to the Law--
30143	58	10	9	 He then  adds, <"I have come to do Thy will."> He does away with the first in order to establish the second.
30144	58	10	10	 It is through that divine will that we  have been set free from sin, through the offering of Jesus Christ as our sacrifice once for all.
30145	58	10	11	 And while every  priest stands ministering, day after day, and constantly offering the same sacrifices--though such can never rid us of our sins--
30146	58	10	12	 this Priest, on the contrary, after offering for sins a single sacrifice of perpetual efficacy, took His seat at God's right hand,
30147	58	10	13	 waiting from that time onward until His enemies be put as a footstool under His feet.
30148	58	10	14	 For by a single offering He has for ever completed the blessing for those whom He is setting free from sin.
30149	58	10	15	 And the Holy Spirit also gives us His testimony; for when He had said,
30150	58	10	16	 <"`This is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days,' says the Lord: `I will put My laws upon their hearts and will write them on their minds;'">
30151	58	10	17	 He adds, <"And their sins and offences I will remember no longer.">
30152	58	10	18	 But where these have been forgiven no further offering for sin is required.
30153	58	10	19	  Since then, brethren, we have  free access to the Holy place through the blood of Jesus,
30154	58	10	20	 by the new and  ever-living way which He opened up for us through the rending of the veil--that is to say, of His earthly nature--
30155	58	10	21	 and since we have a great Priest who has authority over the house of God,
30156	58	10	22	 let us draw near with sincerity and unfaltering faith, having had our hearts sprinkled, once for all, from consciences oppressed with sin, and our bodies bathed in pure water.
30157	58	10	23	 Let us hold firmly to an unflinching avowal of our hope, for He is faithful who gave us the promises.
30158	58	10	24	 And let us bestow thought on one another with a view to arousing one another to brotherly love and right conduct;
30159	58	10	25	 not neglecting--as some habitually do--to meet together, but encouraging one another, and doing this all the more since you can see  the day of Christ approaching.
30160	58	10	26	 For if we wilfully persist in sin after having received the full knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains in reserve any other sacrifice for sins.
30161	58	10	27	 There remains nothing but a certain awful expectation of judgement, and the fury of a fire which before long will  devour  the enemies of the truth.
30162	58	10	28	 Any one who bids defiance to the Law of Moses is put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
30163	58	10	29	 How much  severer punishment, think you, will he be held to deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, has not regarded as holy that Covenant-blood with which he was set free from sin, and has insulted the Spirit from whom comes grace?
30164	58	10	30	 For we know who it is that has said, <"Vengeance belongs to Me: I will pay back;"> and again, <"The Lord will be His people's judge.">
30165	58	10	31	 It is an awful thing to fall into the hands of the  ever-living God.
30166	58	10	32	 But continually recall to mind the days now past, when on being first enlightened you went through a great conflict and many sufferings.
30167	58	10	33	 This was partly through allowing yourselves to be made a public spectacle amid reproaches and persecutions, and partly through coming forward to share the sufferings of those who were thus treated.
30168	58	10	34	 For you not only showed sympathy with those who were imprisoned, but you even submitted with joy when your property was taken from you, being well aware  that you have in your own selves a more valuable possession and one which will remain.
30169	58	10	35	 Therefore do not cast from you your confident hope, for it will receive a vast reward.
30170	58	10	36	 For you stand in need of patient endurance, so that, as the result of having done the will of God, you may receive the promised blessing.
30171	58	10	37	 For there is still but a short time and then <"The coming One will come and will not delay.
30172	58	10	38	 But it is by faith that My righteous servant shall live; and if he shrinks back, My soul takes no pleasure in him.">
30173	58	10	39	  But we are not people who shrink back and perish, but are among those who believe and gain possession of their souls.
30174	58	11	1	 Now  faith is a well-grounded assurance of that for which we hope, and a conviction of the reality of things which we do not see.
30175	58	11	2	 For by it the saints of old won God's approval.
30176	58	11	3	 Through faith we understand that  the worlds  came into being, and still exist, at the command of God, so that what is seen does not owe its existence to that which is visible.
30177	58	11	4	 Through faith Abel offered to God a  more acceptable sacrifice than Cain did, and  through this faith he obtained testimony that he was righteous, God giving the testimony by accepting his gifts; and  through it,  though he is dead, he still speaks.
30178	58	11	5	 Through faith Enoch was taken from the earth so that he did not see death, and he could not be found, because God had taken him; for before he was taken we have evidence that he truly pleased God.
30179	58	11	6	 But where there is no faith it is impossible truly to please Him; for the man who draws near to God must believe that there is a God and that He proves Himself a rewarder of those who earnestly try to find Him.
30180	58	11	7	 Through faith Noah, being divinely taught about things as yet unseen, reverently gave heed and built an ark for the safety of his family, and by this act he condemned the world, and became  an heir of the righteousness which depends on faith.
30181	58	11	8	 Through faith Abraham,  upon being called to leave home and go into a land which he was soon to receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing where he was going to.
30182	58	11	9	 Through faith he came and made his home for a time in a land which had been promised to him, as if in a foreign country, living in tents together with Isaac and Jacob, sharers with him in the same promise;
30183	58	11	10	 for he continually looked forward to  the city which has  the foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
30184	58	11	11	 Through faith even Sarah herself received strength to become a mother--although she was past  the time of life for this--because she judged Him faithful who had given the promise.
30185	58	11	12	 And thus there sprang from one man, and him practically dead, a nation like the stars of the sky in number, and like the sands on the sea shore which cannot be counted.
30186	58	11	13	 All these died in the possession of faith. They had not received the promised blessings, but had seen them from a distance and had greeted them, and had acknowledged themselves to be foreigners and strangers here on earth;
30187	58	11	14	 for men who acknowledge this make it manifest that they are seeking  elsewhere a country of their own.
30188	58	11	15	 And if they had cherished the remembrance of the country they had left, they would have found an opportunity to return;
30189	58	11	16	 but, as it is,  we see them eager for a better land, that is to say, a heavenly one. For this reason God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has  now  prepared a city for them.
30190	58	11	17	 Through faith Abraham, as soon as God put him to the test,  offered up Isaac. Yes, he who had joyfully welcomed the promises was on the point of sacrificing his only son
30191	58	11	18	 with regard to whom he had been told, <"It is through Isaac that your posterity shall be traced.">
30192	58	11	19	 For he reckoned that God is even able to raise a man up from among the dead, and, figuratively speaking, it was from among the dead that he received Isaac again.
30193	58	11	20	 Through faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even in connexion with things soon to come.
30194	58	11	21	 Through faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons, and, leaning on the top of his staff,  worshipped God.
30195	58	11	22	 Through faith Joseph, when he was near his end,  made mention of the departure of the descendants of Israel, and gave orders about  his own body.
30196	58	11	23	  Through faith the child Moses was hid for three months by his parents, because they saw  his rare beauty; and the king's edict had no terror for them.
30197	58	11	24	 Through faith Moses, when he grew to manhood, refused to be known as Pharaoh's daughter's son,
30198	58	11	25	 having determined to endure ill-treatment along with the people of God rather than enjoy the short-lived pleasures  of sin;
30199	58	11	26	 because he deemed  the reproaches which he might meet with in the service of the Christ to be greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt; for he  fixed his gaze on the coming reward.
30200	58	11	27	 Through faith  he left Egypt, not being frightened by the king's anger; for he held on his course as seeing the unseen One.
30201	58	11	28	 Through faith he  instituted the Passover, and the sprinkling with blood so that the destroyer of the firstborn might not touch the Israelites.
30202	58	11	29	 Through faith they passed through the Red Sea as though they were passing over dry land, but the Egyptians, when they tried to do the same, were swallowed up.
30203	58	11	30	 Through faith the walls of Jericho fell to the ground after being surrounded for seven days.
30204	58	11	31	 Through faith the notorious sinner Rahab did not perish along with the disobedient, for she had welcomed the spies and had sheltered them.
30205	58	11	32	 And why need I say more? For time will fail me if I tell the story of  Gideon,  Barak,  Samson,  Jephthah, and of  David and  Samuel and the Prophets;
30206	58	11	33	 men who, as the result of faith, conquered whole kingdoms, brought about true justice, obtained  promises from God, stopped lions' mouths,
30207	58	11	34	 deprived fire of its power, escaped being killed by the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put to flight foreign armies.
30208	58	11	35	 Women received back their dear ones alive from the dead; and others were  put to death with torture, refusing the deliverance offered to them--that they might secure  a better resurrection.
30209	58	11	36	 Others again were tested by cruel mockery and by scourging; yes, and by chains and imprisonment.
30210	58	11	37	 They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tried by temptation, they were killed with the sword. They went from place to place in sheepskins or goatskins, enduring want, oppression and cruelty.
30211	58	11	38	 (They were men of whom the world was not worthy.) They wandered across deserts and mountains, or hid themselves in caves and in holes in the ground.
30212	58	11	39	 And although by their faith all these people won God's approval,  none of them received the fulfilment of  His great promise;
30213	58	11	40	 for God had provided for them and us something better, so that apart from us they were not to  attain to full blessedness.
30214	58	12	1	 Therefore, surrounded as we are by such a vast cloud of  witnesses, let us fling aside every encumbrance and  the sin that so readily entangles our feet. And let us run with patient endurance the race that lies before us,
30215	58	12	2	  simply fixing our gaze upon Jesus,  our Prince Leader in the faith, who will also award us the prize. He, for the sake of the joy which lay before Him, patiently endured the cross, looking with contempt upon its shame, and afterwards seated Himself--  where He still sits--at the right hand of the throne of God.
30216	58	12	3	 Therefore, if you would escape becoming weary and faint-hearted, compare your own sufferings with those of Him who endured such hostility directed  against Him by sinners.
30217	58	12	4	 In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted so as to endanger your lives;
30218	58	12	5	 and you have quite forgotten the encouraging words which are addressed to you as sons, and which say, <"My son, do not think lightly of the Lord's discipline, and do not faint when He corrects you;
30219	58	12	6	 for those whom the Lord loves He disciplines: and He scourges every son whom He acknowledges.">
30220	58	12	7	 The sufferings that you are enduring are for your discipline. God is dealing with you as sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?
30221	58	12	8	 And if you are left without discipline, of which every true son has had a share, that shows that you are bastards, and not true sons.
30222	58	12	9	 Besides this,  our earthly fathers used to discipline us and we treated them with respect, and shall we not be still more submissive to the Father of our spirits, and live?
30223	58	12	10	 It is true that they disciplined us for a few years according as they thought fit; but He does it for our certain good, in order that we may become sharers in His own holy character.
30224	58	12	11	 Now, at the time, discipline seems to be a matter not for joy, but for grief; yet it afterwards yields to those who have passed through its training a result full of peace--namely, righteousness.
30225	58	12	12	  Therefore strengthen the drooping hands and paralysed knees,
30226	58	12	13	 and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put entirely out of joint
30227	58	12	14	 but may rather be restored. Persistently strive for peace with all men, and for that  growth in holiness apart from which  no one will  see the Lord.
30228	58	12	15	 Be carefully on your guard lest there be any one who falls back from the grace of God; lest any root bearing bitter fruit spring up and cause trouble among you, and through it  the whole brotherhood be defiled;
30229	58	12	16	 lest there be a fornicator, or an ungodly person like Esau, who, in return for a single meal, parted with the birthright which belonged to him.
30230	58	12	17	 For you know that even afterwards, when he wished to secure  the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no opportunity for undoing what he had done, though he sought the blessing earnestly with tears.
30231	58	12	18	 For you have not come to a  material  object all ablaze with fire, and to gloom and darkness and storm and trumpet-blast and the sound of words--
30232	58	12	19	 a sound of such a kind that those who heard it entreated that no more should be added.
30233	58	12	20	 For they could not endure the order which had been given, <"Even a wild beast, if it touches the mountain, shall be stoned to death;">
30234	58	12	21	 and so terrible was the scene that Moses said, <"I tremble with fear.">
30235	58	12	22	 On the contrary you have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the  ever-living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to countless hosts of angels,
30236	58	12	23	 to the great festal gathering and Church of the first-born, whose names are recorded in Heaven, and to a Judge who is God of all, and to the spirits of righteous men  made perfect,
30237	58	12	24	 and to Jesus the negotiator of a new Covenant, and to the sprinkled blood which speaks in  more gracious tones than that of Abel.
30238	58	12	25	 Be careful not to refuse to listen to Him who is speaking to you. For if they of old did not escape unpunished when they refused to listen to him who spoke on earth,  much less shall we escape who turn a deaf ear to Him who now speaks from Heaven.
30239	58	12	26	 His voice then shook the earth, but now we have His promise, <"Yet again I will, once for all, cause not only the earth to tremble, but Heaven also.">
30240	58	12	27	 Here the words "Yet again, once for all" denote the removal of the things which can be shaken--created things--in order that the things which cannot be shaken may remain.
30241	58	12	28	 Therefore, receiving,  as we now do, a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us cherish thankfulness so that we may  ever offer to God an acceptable service, with godly reverence and awe.
30242	58	12	29	 For our God is  also a consuming fire.
30243	58	13	1	 Let brotherly love  always continue.
30244	58	13	2	 Do not neglect to show kindness to strangers; for, in this way, some, without knowing it, have had angels as their guests.
30245	58	13	3	  Remember prisoners, as if you were in prison with them; and remember those suffering ill-treatment, for you yourselves also are still in the body.
30246	58	13	4	 Let marriage be held in honour among all, and let the marriage bed be unpolluted; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.
30247	58	13	5	 Your lives should be untainted by love for money. Be content with what you have; for God Himself has said, <"I will never, never  let go your hand: I will never never forsake you.">
30248	58	13	6	 So that we fearlessly say, <"The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid: what can man do to me?">
30249	58	13	7	 Remember your former leaders--it was they who brought you God's Message. Bear in mind how they ended their lives, and imitate their faith.
30250	58	13	8	  Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and to-day--yes, and to the ages to come.
30251	58	13	9	 Do not be drawn aside by all sorts of strange teaching; for it is well to have the heart  made stedfast through God's grace, and not by special kinds of food, from which those who scrupulously attend to them have derived no benefit.
30252	58	13	10	 We Christians have  an altar from which the ministers of  the Jewish Tent have no right to eat.
30253	58	13	11	 For the bodies of those animals of which the blood is carried by the High Priest into  the Holy place as an offering for sin, are burned outside the camp.
30254	58	13	12	 And for this reason Jesus also, in order, by His own blood, to set the people free from sin, suffered outside the gate.
30255	58	13	13	 Therefore let us go to Him outside  the camp, sharing the insults directed against Him.
30256	58	13	14	 For we have no permanent  city here, but we are longing for the city which is soon to be ours.
30257	58	13	15	 Through Him, then, let us continually lay on the altar a sacrifice of praise to God, namely, the utterance of lips that give thanks to His Name.
30258	58	13	16	 And do not forget to be kind and liberal; for with sacrifices of that sort God is greatly pleased.
30259	58	13	17	 Obey your leaders and be submissive to them. For they are keeping watch over your souls as those who will have to give account; that they may do this with joy and not with lamentation. For that would be of no advantage to you.
30260	58	13	18	 Keep on praying for us; for  we are sure that we have clear consciences, and we desire to live nobly in every respect.
30261	58	13	19	 I specially urge this upon you in order that I may be the more speedily restored to you.
30262	58	13	20	 Now may God who gives peace, and brought Jesus, our Lord, up again from among the dead--even Him who, by virtue of the blood of the eternal Covenant, is the great Shepherd of the sheep--
30263	58	13	21	 fully equip you with every grace that you may need for the doing of His will, producing in us that which will truly please Him through Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory to the Ages of the Ages! Amen.
30264	58	13	22	 Bear with me, brethren, when I thus exhort you; for, in fact, it is but a short letter that I have written to you.
30265	58	13	23	  You will rejoice to hear that our brother Timothy has been set at liberty. If he comes soon, I will see you with him.
30266	58	13	24	 Greet all your leaders and all God's people. The brethren from Italy send you greetings.
30267	58	13	25	 Grace be with you all! Amen.
30268	59	1	1	 James, a bondservant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ: to the  twelve tribes who are scattered over the world. All good wishes.
30269	59	1	2	 Reckon it nothing but joy, my brethren, whenever you find yourselves hedged in by various  trials.
30270	59	1	3	 Be assured that the testing of your faith leads to power of endurance.
30271	59	1	4	 Only let endurance have perfect results so that you may become perfect and complete, deficient in nothing.
30272	59	1	5	 And if any one of you is deficient in wisdom, let him ask God for it, who gives with open hand to all men, and without upbraiding; and it will be given him.
30273	59	1	6	 But let him ask in faith and have no doubts; for he who has doubts is like the surge of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed into spray.
30274	59	1	7	 A person of that sort must not expect  to receive anything from the Lord--
30275	59	1	8	 such a one is a man of two minds, undecided in every step he takes.
30276	59	1	9	 Let a brother in humble life rejoice when raised to a higher position;
30277	59	1	10	 but a rich man should rejoice in being brought low, for like flowers among the herbage rich men will pass away.
30278	59	1	11	 The sun rises with his scorching heat and dries up the herbage, so that its flowers drop off and the beauty of its appearance perishes, and in the same way rich men with all their prosperity will fade away.
30279	59	1	12	 Blessed is he who patiently endures  trials; for when he has stood the test, he will gain the victor's crown--even the  crown of Life--which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.
30280	59	1	13	 Let no one say when passing through  trial, "My temptation is from God;" for God is incapable of being tempted to do evil, and He Himself tempts no one.
30281	59	1	14	 But when a man is tempted, it is his own passions that carry him away and  serve as a bait.
30282	59	1	15	 Then  the passion conceives, and becomes the parent of sin; and sin,  when fully matured, gives birth to death.
30283	59	1	16	 Do not be deceived, my dearly-loved brethren.
30284	59	1	17	 Every gift which is good, and every perfect boon, is from above, and comes down from the Father, who is the source of all Light. In Him there is no variation nor the slightest suggestion of change.
30285	59	1	18	 In accordance with His will He made us His children through the Message of the truth, so that we might, in a sense, be the Firstfruits of the things which He has created.
30286	59	1	19	 You know this, my dearly-loved brethren. But let every one be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to be angry.
30287	59	1	20	 For a man's anger does not lead to action which God regards as righteous.
30288	59	1	21	  Ridding yourselves, therefore, of all that is vile and of the evil influences which prevail around you, welcome in a humble spirit the Message implanted within you, which is able to save your souls.
30289	59	1	22	 But prove yourselves obedient to the Message, and do not be mere hearers of it, imposing a delusion upon yourselves.
30290	59	1	23	 For if any one listens but does not obey, he is like a man who carefully looks at  his own face in a mirror.
30291	59	1	24	 Although he  has looked carefully at himself, he goes away, and has immediately forgotten the sort of man  he is.
30292	59	1	25	 But he who  looks closely into the perfect Law--the Law of freedom--and continues looking, he, being not a hearer who forgets, but an obedient doer, will as the result of his obedience be blessed.
30293	59	1	26	 If a man  thinks that he is scrupulously religious, although he is not curbing his tongue but is deceiving  himself, his religious service is worthless.
30294	59	1	27	 The religious service which is pure and stainless in the sight of our God and Father is to visit fatherless children and widowed women in their time of trouble, and to keep one's own self unspotted from the world.
30295	59	2	1	 My brethren, you must not  make distinctions between one man and another while you are striving to maintain faith in the Lord Jesus Christ,  who is our glory.
30296	59	2	2	 For suppose a man comes into one of your meetings wearing gold rings and fine clothes, and there also comes in a poor man wearing shabby clothes,
30297	59	2	3	 and you pay court to the one who wears the fine clothes, and say, "Sit here; this is a good place;" while to the poor man you say, "Stand there, or sit on the floor at my feet;"
30298	59	2	4	 is it not plain that in your hearts you  have little faith, seeing that you have become judges full of wrong thoughts?
30299	59	2	5	 Listen, my dearly-loved brethren. Has not God chosen those whom the world regards as poor to be rich in faith and heirs of  the Kingdom which He has promised to those that love Him?
30300	59	2	6	 But *you* have put dishonour upon the poor man. Yet is it not the rich who grind you down? Are not they the very people who drag you into the Law courts? --
30301	59	2	7	 and the very people who speak evil of the noble Name by which you are called?
30302	59	2	8	 If, however, you are keeping the Law  as supreme, in obedience to the Commandment which says <"You are to love your fellow man just as you love yourself,"> you are acting rightly.
30303	59	2	9	 But if you are making distinctions between one man and another, you are guilty of sin, and are convicted by the Law as offenders.
30304	59	2	10	 A man who has kept the Law as a whole, but has  failed to keep some one command, has become guilty of violating all.
30305	59	2	11	 For He who said, <"Do not commit adultery,"> also said, <"Do not commit murder,"> and if you are a murderer, although not an adulterer, you have become an offender against the Law.
30306	59	2	12	 Speak and act as those should who are expecting to be judged by the Law of freedom.
30307	59	2	13	 For he who shows no mercy will have judgement given against him without mercy; but mercy triumphs over judgement.
30308	59	2	14	 What good is it, my brethren, if a man professes to have faith, and yet his actions do not correspond? Can such faith save him?
30309	59	2	15	 Suppose a Christian brother or sister is poorly clad or lacks daily food,
30310	59	2	16	 and one of you says  to them,  "I wish you well;  keep yourselves warm and well fed," and yet you do not give them what they need; what is the use of that?
30311	59	2	17	 So also faith, if it is unaccompanied by obedience, has no life in it--so long as it stands alone.
30312	59	2	18	 Nay, some one will say, "You have faith, I have actions: prove to me your faith apart from corresponding actions and I will prove mine to you by my actions.
30313	59	2	19	 You believe that  God is one, and you are quite right: evil spirits also believe this, and shudder."
30314	59	2	20	 But, idle boaster, are you willing to be taught how it is that faith apart from obedience is worthless? Take the case of Abraham our forefather.
30315	59	2	21	 Was it, or was it not, because of his actions that he was declared to be righteous as the result of his having offered up his son Isaac upon the altar?
30316	59	2	22	  You notice that his faith was co-operating with his actions, and that by his actions his faith was perfected;
30317	59	2	23	 and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, <"And Abraham believed God, and his faith was placed to his credit as righteousness,"> and he received the name of `God's friend.'
30318	59	2	24	 You all see that it is because of actions that a man is pronounced righteous, and not simply because of faith.
30319	59	2	25	 In the same way also was not the notorious sinner Rahab declared to be righteous because of her actions when she welcomed the  spies and hurriedly helped them to escape another way?
30320	59	2	26	 For  just as a human body without a spirit is lifeless, so also faith is lifeless if it is unaccompanied by obedience.
30321	59	3	1	 Do not be eager, my brethren, for many among you to become teachers; for you know that we teachers shall undergo severer judgement.
30322	59	3	2	 For we often  stumble and fall, all of us. If there is any one who never stumbles in speech, that man has reached maturity of character and is able to curb his whole nature.
30323	59	3	3	  Remember that we put the horses' bit into their mouths to make them obey us, and so we turn their whole bodies round.
30324	59	3	4	 So too with ships, great as they are, and often driven along by strong gales, yet they can be steered with a very small rudder in whichever direction the caprice of the man at the helm chooses.
30325	59	3	5	 In the same way the tongue is an insignificant part of the body, but it is immensely boastful. Remember how a mere spark may set a vast  forest in flames.
30326	59	3	6	 And the tongue is a fire. That world of iniquity, the tongue, is placed within us  spotting and soiling our whole nature, and setting the whole round of our lives on fire, being itself set on fire by Gehenna.
30327	59	3	7	 For brute nature under all its forms--beasts and birds, reptiles and fishes--can be subjected and  kept in subjection by human nature.
30328	59	3	8	 But the tongue no man or woman is able to tame. It is an ever-busy mischief, and is full of deadly poison.
30329	59	3	9	 With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who  are made in God's likeness.
30330	59	3	10	 Out of the same mouth there proceed blessing and cursing. My brethren, this ought not to be.
30331	59	3	11	 In a fountain, are fresh water and bitter sent forth from the same opening?
30332	59	3	12	  Can a fig-tree, my brethren, yield olives, or a vine yield figs? No; and neither can salt water yield sweet.
30333	59	3	13	 Which of you is a wise and well-instructed man? Let him prove it by a right life with conduct guided by a wisely teachable spirit.
30334	59	3	14	 But if in your hearts you have bitter feelings of envy and rivalry, do not speak boastfully and falsely, in defiance of the truth.
30335	59	3	15	  That is not the wisdom which comes down from above: it belongs to earth, to the  unspiritual nature, and to evil spirits.
30336	59	3	16	 For where envy and rivalry are, there also are unrest and every vile deed.
30337	59	3	17	 The wisdom from above is first of all pure, then peaceful, courteous, not self-willed, full of compassion and kind actions,  free from favouritism and from all insincerity.
30338	59	3	18	  And peace, for those who strive for peace, is the seed of which the harvest is righteousness.
30339	59	4	1	 What causes wars and contentions  among you? Is it not the cravings which are ever at war within you for various pleasures?
30340	59	4	2	  You covet things and yet cannot get them; you commit murder; you have passionate desires and yet cannot gain your end; you begin to fight and make war. You have not, because you do not pray;
30341	59	4	3	 or you pray and yet do not receive, because you pray wrongly, your object being to waste what you get on some pleasure or another.
30342	59	4	4	  You unfaithful women, do you not know that friendship with the world means enmity to God? Therefore whoever is bent on being friendly with the world makes himself an enemy to God.
30343	59	4	5	 Or do you suppose that it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, "The Spirit which  He has caused to dwell in our hearts yearns jealously  over us"?
30344	59	4	6	 But He gives more abundant grace, as is implied in His saying, <"God sets Himself against the haughty, but to the lowly He gives grace.">
30345	59	4	7	 Submit therefore to God: resist the Devil, and he will flee from you.
30346	59	4	8	 Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and make your hearts pure, you who are half-hearted towards God.
30347	59	4	9	 Afflict yourselves and mourn and weep aloud; let your laughter be turned into grief, and your gladness into shame.
30348	59	4	10	 Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you.
30349	59	4	11	 Do not speak evil of one another, brethren. The man who speaks evil of a brother-man or judges his brother-man speaks evil of the Law and judges the Law. But if you judge the Law, you are no longer one who obeys the Law, but one who judges it.
30350	59	4	12	 The only real Lawgiver and Judge is He who is able to save or to destroy. Who are you to sit in judgement on your fellow man?
30351	59	4	13	 Come, you who say, "To-day or to-morrow we will go to this or that city, and spend a year there and carry on a successful business,"
30352	59	4	14	 when, all the while, you do not even know what will happen to-morrow. For what is the nature of your life? Why, it is but a mist, which appears for a short time and then is seen no more.
30353	59	4	15	 Instead of that you ought to say, "If it is the Lord's will, we shall live and do this or that."
30354	59	4	16	 But, as the case stands, it is in mere self-confidence that you boast: all such boasting is evil.
30355	59	4	17	 If,  however, a man knows what it is right to do and yet does not do it, he commits a sin.
30356	59	5	1	 Come, you rich men, weep aloud and howl for your sorrows which will soon be upon you.
30357	59	5	2	 Your treasures  have rotted, and your piles of clothing  are moth-eaten;
30358	59	5	3	 your gold and your silver have become covered with rust, and the rust on them will give evidence against you, and will eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded up wealth in  these last days.
30359	59	5	4	 I tell you that the pay of the labourers who have gathered in your crops--pay which you are keeping back--is calling out against you; and the outcries of those who have been your reapers have entered into the ears of the Lord of the armies of Heaven.
30360	59	5	5	 Here on earth you have lived self-indulgent and profligate lives. You have  stupefied yourselves with gross feeding; but a day of slaughter has come.
30361	59	5	6	 You have condemned--you have murdered--  the righteous man: he offers no resistance.
30362	59	5	7	  Be patient therefore, brethren, until the Coming of the Lord. Notice how eagerly a farmer waits for a valuable crop! He is patient over it till it has received the early and the later rain.
30363	59	5	8	 So you also must be patient: keeping up your courage; for the Coming of the Lord is now close at hand.
30364	59	5	9	 Do not cry out in condemnation of one another, brethren, lest you come under judgement. I tell you that the Judge is standing at the door.
30365	59	5	10	 In illustration, brethren, of persecution patiently endured take the Prophets who have spoken as messengers from the Lord.
30366	59	5	11	 Remember that we call those blessed who endured what they did. You have also heard of Job's patient endurance, and have seen the issue of the Lord's dealings with him--how full of tenderness and pity the Lord is.
30367	59	5	12	 But above all things, my brethren,  do not swear, either by Heaven or by the earth, or with any other oath. Let your `yes' be simply `yes,' and your `no' be simply `no;' that you may not come under condemnation.
30368	59	5	13	 Is one of you suffering? Let him pray. Is any one in good spirits? Let him sing a psalm.
30369	59	5	14	 Is any one ill? Let him send for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him,  after anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
30370	59	5	15	 And the prayer of faith will restore the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up to health; and if he  has committed sins, they shall be forgiven.
30371	59	5	16	 Therefore  confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be cured. The  heartfelt supplication of a righteous man exerts a mighty influence.
30372	59	5	17	 Elijah was a man with a nature similar to ours, and he earnestly prayed that there might be no rain: and no rain fell on the land for three years and six months.
30373	59	5	18	 Again he prayed, and the sky gave rain and the land yielded its crops.
30374	59	5	19	 My brethren, if one of you strays from the truth and some one brings him back,
30375	59	5	20	  let him know that he who brings a sinner back from his evil ways will save the man's soul from death and throw a veil over a multitude of sins.
30376	60	1	1	 Peter, an Apostle of Jesus Christ: To God's own people scattered over the earth, who are living as foreigners in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia,  Roman Asia, and Bithynia,
30377	60	1	2	 chosen in accordance with the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, with a view to their obedience and to their being sprinkled with the blood of Jesus Christ. May more and more grace and peace be granted to you.
30378	60	1	3	 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who in His great mercy has begotten us anew to an  ever-living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
30379	60	1	4	 to an inheritance imperishable, undefiled and unfading, which has been reserved in Heaven for you,
30380	60	1	5	 whom God in His power is guarding through faith for a salvation that even now stands ready for unveiling  at the End of the Age.
30381	60	1	6	  Rejoice triumphantly  in the prospect of this, even if now,  for a short time, you are compelled to sorrow amid various trials.
30382	60	1	7	 The sorrow comes in order that the testing of your faith--being more  precious than that of gold, which perishes and yet  is proved by fire--may be found to result in praise and glory and honour at the re-appearing of Jesus Christ.
30383	60	1	8	 Him you love, though  your eyes have never looked on Him. In Him, though at present you cannot see Him, you nevertheless trust, and triumph with a joy which is unspeakable and is crowned with glory,
30384	60	1	9	 while you are securing as the outcome of your faith the  salvation of your souls.
30385	60	1	10	 There were Prophets who earnestly inquired about that salvation, and closely searched into it--even those who spoke beforehand of the grace which was to come to you.
30386	60	1	11	 They were eager to know the time which the Spirit of Christ within them kept indicating, or the characteristics of that time, when they solemnly made known beforehand the sufferings that were to come upon Christ and the glories which would follow.
30387	60	1	12	 To them it was revealed that they were serving not themselves but you, when they foretold the very things which have now been openly declared to you  by those who, having been taught by the Holy Spirit which had been sent from Heaven, brought you the Good News. Angels long to  stoop and look into these things.
30388	60	1	13	 Therefore gird up your minds and fix your hopes calmly and unfalteringly upon the boon that is soon to be yours, at the re-appearing of Jesus Christ.
30389	60	1	14	 And, since you delight in obedience, do not shape your lives by the cravings which used to dominate you in the time of your ignorance,
30390	60	1	15	 but--in imitation of the holy One who has called you--you also must be holy in all your habits of life.
30391	60	1	16	 Because it stands written, <"You are to be holy, because I am holy.">
30392	60	1	17	 And if you address as your Father Him who judges  impartially in accordance with each man's actions, then spend in fear the time of your stay here on earth,
30393	60	1	18	 knowing, as you do, that it was not with a ransom of perishable wealth, such as silver or gold, that you were set free from your frivolous habits of life which had been handed down to you from your forefathers,
30394	60	1	19	 but with the precious blood of Christ--as of an  unblemished and spotless lamb.
30395	60	1	20	 He was pre-destined indeed to this work, even before the creation of the world, but has been plainly manifested  in these last days for the sake of you who, through Him,
30396	60	1	21	  are faithful to God, who raised Him from among the dead and gave Him glory, so that  your faith and hope are resting upon God.
30397	60	1	22	 Now that, through your obedience to the truth, you  have purified your souls for cherishing sincere brotherly love, you must love another heartily and fervently.
30398	60	1	23	 For you have been begotten again by God's  ever-living and enduring word from a germ not of perishable, but of imperishable life.
30399	60	1	24	 <"All mankind  resemble the herbage, and all their beauty is like its flowers. The herbage dries up, and its flowers drop off;
30400	60	1	25	 But the word of the Lord remains for ever."> And that means the Message which has been proclaimed among you in the Good News.
30401	60	2	1	 Rid yourselves therefore of all  ill-will and all deceitfulness, of insincerity and envy, and of all evil speaking.
30402	60	2	2	 Thirst,  like newly-born infants, for pure milk for the soul, that by it you may  grow up to salvation;
30403	60	2	3	 if you have had any experience of the goodness of the Lord.
30404	60	2	4	 Come to Him, the ever-living Stone, rejected indeed by men as worthless, but in God's esteem chosen and  held in honour.
30405	60	2	5	 And be yourselves also like living stones that are being built up into a spiritual house, to become a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
30406	60	2	6	 For it is contained in Scripture, <"See, I am placing on Mount Zion a Cornerstone, chosen, and held in honour, and he whose faith rests on Him shall never have reason to feel ashamed.">
30407	60	2	7	 To you believers, therefore, that honour belongs; but for unbelievers-- <"A Stone which the builders rejected has been made the Cornerstone,">
30408	60	2	8	 and <"a Stone for the foot to strike against, and a Rock to stumble over."> Their foot strikes against it because they are disobedient to God's Message, and to this they were appointed.
30409	60	2	9	 But you are a chosen race, a priesthood of kingly lineage, a holy nation, a people belonging specially to God, that you may  make known the perfections of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvellous light.
30410	60	2	10	 Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God. Once you had not found mercy, but now you have.
30411	60	2	11	 Dear friends, I entreat you as pilgrims and foreigners not to indulge the cravings of your lower natures: for all such cravings wage war upon the  soul.
30412	60	2	12	 Live honourable lives among the Gentiles, in order that, although they now speak against you as evil-doers, they may yet witness your good conduct, and may glorify God on the  day of reward and retribution.
30413	60	2	13	 Submit, for the Lord's sake, to every authority set up by man, whether it be to the  Emperor as supreme ruler,
30414	60	2	14	 or to  provincial Governors as sent by  him for the punishment of evil-doers and the encouragement of those who do what is right.
30415	60	2	15	 For it is God's will that by doing what is right you should thus  silence the  ignorant talk of foolish persons.
30416	60	2	16	 Be free men, and yet do not make your freedom  an excuse for base conduct, but be God's bondservants.
30417	60	2	17	 Honour every one. Love the brotherhood, fear God, honour the Emperor.
30418	60	2	18	 Household servants,  be submissive to your masters, and show them the utmost respect--not only if they are kind and thoughtful, but also if they are unreasonable.
30419	60	2	19	 For it is an acceptable thing with God, if, from a sense of duty to Him, a man patiently submits to wrong, when treated unjustly.
30420	60	2	20	  If you do wrong and receive  a blow for it,  what credit is there in your bearing it patiently? But if when you do right and suffer for it you bear it patiently, this is an acceptable thing with God.
30421	60	2	21	 And it is to this you were called; because Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you an example so that you should follow in His steps.
30422	60	2	22	 He never sinned, and no deceitful language was ever heard from His mouth.
30423	60	2	23	 When He was reviled, He did not answer with reviling; when He suffered He uttered no threats, but left  His wrongs in the hands of the righteous Judge.
30424	60	2	24	 The burden of our sins He Himself carried in His own body to the Cross and bore it there, so that we, having died so far as our sins are concerned, may live righteous lives. By His  wounds yours have been healed.
30425	60	2	25	 For you were straying like lost sheep, but now you have come back to the Shepherd and  Protector of your souls.
30426	60	3	1	 Married women, in the same way,  be submissive to your husbands, so that even if some of them  disbelieve the Message, they may,  apart from the Message, be won over by the daily life of their wives, after watching your daily life--
30427	60	3	2	 so full of reverence, and so blameless!
30428	60	3	3	 Your adornment ought not to be a merely outward thing--one of plaiting the hair,  putting on jewelry, or wearing beautiful dresses.
30429	60	3	4	 Instead of that, it should be  a new nature within--the imperishable ornament of a gentle and peaceful spirit, which is indeed precious in the sight of God.
30430	60	3	5	 For in ancient times also this was the way the holy women who set their hopes upon God used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their husbands.
30431	60	3	6	 Thus, for instance, Sarah obeyed Abraham,  acknowledging his authority over her. And you have become Sarah's children if you do what is right and permit nothing whatever to terrify you.
30432	60	3	7	 Married men, in the same way, live with your wives  with a clear recognition of the fact that they are weaker than you. Yet, since you are heirs with them of God's free gift of Life, treat them with honour; so that your prayers may not be hindered.
30433	60	3	8	 In conclusion, all of you should be of one mind, quick  to sympathize, kind to the brethren, tenderhearted, lowly-minded,
30434	60	3	9	 not requiting evil with evil nor abuse with abuse, but, on the contrary, giving a blessing in return, because a blessing is what you have been called by God to inherit.
30435	60	3	10	 For <"He who wishes to be well-satisfied with life and see happy days--  let him restrain his tongue from evil, and his lips from deceitful words;
30436	60	3	11	 Let him turn from evil, and do good; Let him inquire for peace and go in pursuit of it.
30437	60	3	12	 For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and His ears are open to their supplication; but the face of the Lord is set against evil-doers.">
30438	60	3	13	 And who will be able to harm you, if you show yourselves zealous for that which is good?
30439	60	3	14	 But even if you suffer for righteousness' sake, you are to be envied. So do not be alarmed by  their threats, nor troubled;
30440	60	3	15	  but in your hearts consecrate Christ as Lord, being always ready to make your defence to any one who asks from you a reason for the hope which you cherish.
30441	60	3	16	 Yet argue modestly and cautiously, keeping your consciences free from guilt, so that, when you are spoken against, those who slander your good Christian lives may be put to shame.
30442	60	3	17	 For it is better that you should suffer for doing right, if such be God's will, than for doing evil;
30443	60	3	18	 because Christ also once for all  died for sins, the innocent One for the guilty many, in order to bring us to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit,
30444	60	3	19	 in which  He also went and proclaimed His Message to the spirits that were in prison,
30445	60	3	20	 who in ancient times had been disobedient,  while God's longsuffering was patiently waiting in the days of Noah during the building of the Ark,  in which a few persons--eight in number--were brought safely through the water.
30446	60	3	21	 And, corresponding to that figure, the water of baptism now saves you--not the washing off of material defilement, but the craving of a good conscience after God--through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
30447	60	3	22	 who is at God's right hand, having gone into Heaven, angels and authorities and powers having been made subject to Him.
30448	60	4	1	 Since, then, Christ has suffered in the flesh, you also must arm yourselves with a determination to do the same--because he who has suffered in the flesh  has done with sin--
30449	60	4	2	 that in future you may spend the rest of your earthly lives, governed not by human passions, but by the will of God.
30450	60	4	3	 For you have given time enough in the past to the doing of the things which the Gentiles delight in--  pursuing, as you did, a course of  habitual licence, debauchery, hard drinking, noisy revelry, drunkenness and unholy image-worship.
30451	60	4	4	 At this they are astonished--that you do not run into the same excess of profligacy as they do; and they speak abusively of you.
30452	60	4	5	 But they will have to give account to Him who stands ready to pronounce judgement on  the living and the dead.
30453	60	4	6	 For it is with this end in view that  the Good News was proclaimed even to some who were dead, that they may be judged, as all mankind will be judged, in the body, but may be living a godly life in the spirit.
30454	60	4	7	 But the end of all things is now close at hand: therefore be sober-minded and temperate, so that you may give yourselves to prayer.
30455	60	4	8	 Above all continue to love one another fervently, for love throws a veil over a multitude of faults.
30456	60	4	9	 Extend ungrudging hospitality towards one another.
30457	60	4	10	 Whatever be the gifts which each has received, you must use them for one another's benefit, as good stewards of God's many-sided kindness.
30458	60	4	11	 If any one preaches, let it be as uttering God's truth; if any one renders a service to others, let it be in the strength which God supplies; so that in everything glory may be given to God in the name of Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the might to the Ages of the Ages. Amen.
30459	60	4	12	 Dear friends, do not be surprised at finding that that scorching flame of persecution is raging among you to put you to the test--as though some surprising thing were accidentally happening to you.
30460	60	4	13	 On the contrary, in the degree that you share in the sufferings of the Christ, rejoice, so that at the unveiling of His glory you may also rejoice with triumphant gladness.
30461	60	4	14	 You are to be envied, if you are being reproached for bearing the name of Christ; for in that case the Spirit of glory--  even the Spirit of God--is resting upon you.
30462	60	4	15	  But let not one of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evil-doer, or as a spy upon other people's business.
30463	60	4	16	 If, however, any one suffers because he is a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God  for being permitted to bear that name.
30464	60	4	17	 For the time has come for judgement to begin, and to begin at the house of God; and if it begins with us, what will be the end of those who reject God's Good News?
30465	60	4	18	 And if it is difficult even for a righteous man to be saved, what will become of irreligious men and sinners?
30466	60	4	19	 Therefore also, let those who are suffering in accordance with the will of God  entrust their  souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator.
30467	60	5	1	 So I exhort the Elders among you--I who am their fellow Elder and have been an eye-witness of the sufferings of the Christ, and am also a sharer in the glory which is soon to be revealed.
30468	60	5	2	 Be shepherds of God's flock which is among you.  Exercise the oversight not reluctantly but eagerly, in accordance with the will of God; not for base gain but with cheerful minds;
30469	60	5	3	 not lording it over  your Churches but proving yourselves patterns for the flock to imitate.
30470	60	5	4	 And then, when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the never-withering wreath of glory.
30471	60	5	5	 In the same way you younger men must submit to your elders; and all of you must  gird yourselves with humility towards one another, for God sets Himself against the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
30472	60	5	6	 Humble yourselves therefore beneath the mighty hand of God, so that at the right time He may set you on high.
30473	60	5	7	 Throw the whole of your anxiety upon Him, because He Himself cares for you.
30474	60	5	8	 Curb every passion, and  be on the alert. Your  great accuser, the Devil, is going about like a roaring lion to see whom he can devour.
30475	60	5	9	 Withstand him, firm in your faith; knowing that your brethren in other parts of the world are passing through just the same experiences.
30476	60	5	10	 And God, the giver of all grace, who has called you to share His eternal glory, through Christ, after you have suffered for a short time, will Himself make you perfect, firm, and strong.
30477	60	5	11	 To Him be all power unto the Ages of the Ages! Amen.
30478	60	5	12	 I send this short letter by  Silas, our faithful brother--for such I regard him--in order to encourage you, and to bear witness that  what I have told you is the true grace of God. In it stand fast.
30479	60	5	13	  The Church in  Babylon, chosen like yourselves by God, sends greetings, and so does Mark my son.
30480	60	5	14	 Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be with all of you who are in Christ.
30481	61	1	1	  Simon Peter, a bondservant and Apostle of Jesus Christ: To those to whom there has been allotted the same precious faith as that which is ours through the righteousness  of our God and of our Saviour Jesus Christ.
30482	61	1	2	 May more and more grace and peace be granted to you  in a full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,
30483	61	1	3	 seeing that His divine power has given us all things that are needful for life and godliness, through our knowledge of Him who has appealed to us  by His own glorious perfections.
30484	61	1	4	 It is by means of these that He has granted us His precious and  wondrous promises, in order that through them you may,  one and all, become sharers in the very nature of God, having completely escaped the corruption which exists in the world through earthly cravings.
30485	61	1	5	 But for this very reason--adding, on your part, all earnestness--  along with your faith,  manifest  also  a noble character: along with a noble character, knowledge;
30486	61	1	6	 along with knowledge,  self-control; along with self-control, power of endurance;
30487	61	1	7	 along with power of endurance, godliness; along with godliness, brotherly affection; and along with brotherly affection, love.
30488	61	1	8	 If these things exist in you, and continually increase, they prevent your being either idle or unfruitful in advancing towards a full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
30489	61	1	9	 For the man in whom they are lacking is blind and cannot see distant objects,  in that he has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his old sins.
30490	61	1	10	 For this reason, brethren, be all the more in earnest to  make sure that God has called you and chosen you; for it is certain that so long as you practise these things, you will never stumble.
30491	61	1	11	 And so  a triumphant admission into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ will be freely granted to you.
30492	61	1	12	 For this reason I shall always persist in reminding you of these things, although you know them and are stedfast believers in truth which you already possess.
30493	61	1	13	 But I think it right, so long as I remain in  the body, my present dwelling-place, to arouse you by such reminders.
30494	61	1	14	 For I know that the time for me to lay aside  my body is now rapidly drawing near, even as our Lord Jesus Christ has revealed to me.
30495	61	1	15	 So  on every possible occasion I will  also do my best to enable you to recall these things after my departure.
30496	61	1	16	 For when we made known to you the power and Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, we were not eagerly following cleverly devised legends, but we had been eye-witnesses of His majesty.
30497	61	1	17	 He received honour and glory from God the Father, and out of the wondrous glory words such as these were  spoken to Him, "This is My dearly-loved Son, in whom  I take delight."
30498	61	1	18	 And we ourselves heard these words  come from Heaven, when we were with Him on the holy mountain.
30499	61	1	19	 And in the written word of prophecy we have  something more permanent; to which  you do well to pay attention--as to a lamp shining in a dimly-lighted place--until day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
30500	61	1	20	 But, above all, remember that no prophecy in Scripture will be found to have come from the prophet's own prompting;
30501	61	1	21	 for never did any prophecy come by human will, but  men sent by God spoke as they were  impelled by the Holy Spirit.
30502	61	2	1	 But there were also false prophets among the people, as there will be teachers of falsehood among you also, who will cunningly introduce fatal  divisions, disowning even the Sovereign Lord who has redeemed them,  and bringing on themselves swift destruction.
30503	61	2	2	 And in their immoral ways they will have many eager disciples, through whom religion will be brought into disrepute.
30504	61	2	3	 Thirsting for riches, they will trade on you with their canting talk. From of old their judgement  has been working itself out, and their destruction  has not been slumbering.
30505	61	2	4	 For God did not spare angels when they had sinned, but hurling them down to Tartarus consigned them to  caves of darkness, keeping them in readiness for judgement.
30506	61	2	5	 And He did not spare the ancient world, although He preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, with seven others, when He brought a deluge on the world of the ungodly.
30507	61	2	6	 He reduced to ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, and condemned them to overthrow, making them an example to people who might  in future be living godless lives.
30508	61	2	7	 But when righteous Lot was sore distressed by the gross misconduct of immoral men He rescued him.
30509	61	2	8	 (For their lawless deeds were torture, day after day, to the pure soul of that righteous man--all that he saw and heard whilst living in their midst.)
30510	61	2	9	 Since all this is so, the Lord knows how to rescue godly men from temptation, and on the other hand how to keep the unrighteous under punishment in readiness for the Day of Judgement,
30511	61	2	10	 and especially those who are abandoned to sensuality--craving, as they do, for polluted things, and scorning control.  Fool-hardy and self-willed, they do not tremble when speaking evil of glorious beings;
30512	61	2	11	 while angels, though greater than they in might and power, do not bring any insulting accusation against such  in the presence of the Lord.
30513	61	2	12	 But these men, like brute beasts, created (with their natural instincts) only to be captured  or destroyed, are abusive in matters of which they are ignorant, and in their corruption will perish,
30514	61	2	13	 being  doomed to receive a requital for their guilt. They reckon it pleasure to feast daintily in broad  daylight. They are spots and blemishes, while feeding luxuriously at their  love-feasts, and banqueting with you.
30515	61	2	14	  Their very eyes are full of adultery--being eyes which never cease from sin. These men set traps to catch unstedfast souls, their own hearts being well trained in greed.  They are fore-doomed to God's curse!
30516	61	2	15	  Forsaking the straight road, they have gone astray,  having eagerly followed in the steps of Balaam, the son of Beor, who was bent on securing the wages of unrighteousness.
30517	61	2	16	 But he was rebuked for his transgression: a dumb  ass spoke with a human voice and checked the madness of the Prophet.
30518	61	2	17	 These people are wells without water, mists driven along by a storm, men for whom the dense darkness has been reserved.
30519	61	2	18	 For, while they pour out their frivolous and arrogant talk, they use earthly cravings--every kind of immorality--as a  bait to entrap men who are just escaping from the influence of those who live in error.
30520	61	2	19	 And  they promise them freedom, although they are themselves the slaves of what is corrupt. For a man is the slave of  any one by whom he has been worsted in fight.
30521	61	2	20	 For if, after escaping from the pollutions of the world through a full knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, people are once more entangled in these pollutions and are overcome, their last state has become worse than their first.
30522	61	2	21	 For it would have been better for them not to have fully known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandments in which they were instructed.
30523	61	2	22	 Their case is that described in the true proverb, <"A dog returns to what he has vomited,"> and also in the other proverb, "The sow has washed itself and now goes back to roll  in its filth."
30524	61	3	1	 This letter which I am now writing to you, dear friends, is my second letter. In both my letters I seek to revive in your honest minds the memory of certain things,
30525	61	3	2	 so that you may recall the words spoken long ago by the holy Prophets, and the commandments of our Lord and Saviour given you through your Apostles.
30526	61	3	3	 But, above all, remember that, in  the last days, men will come who make a mock at everything--men governed only by their own passions,
30527	61	3	4	 and, asking, "What has become of His promised  Return? For from the time our forefathers fell asleep all things continue as they have been ever since the creation of the world."
30528	61	3	5	 For they are wilfully blind to the fact that there were heavens which existed of old, and an earth, the latter  arising out of water and extending continuously through water, by the command of God;
30529	61	3	6	 and that,  by means of these, the then existing race of men was overwhelmed with water and perished.
30530	61	3	7	 But the present heavens and the present earth are,  by the command of the same God, kept stored up, reserved for fire in preparation for  a day of judgement and of destruction for the ungodly.
30531	61	3	8	 But there is one thing, dear friends, which you must not forget. With the Lord  one day resembles a thousand years and a thousand years resemble one day.
30532	61	3	9	 The Lord is not slow in fulfilling His promise, in the sense in which some men speak of slowness. But He bears patiently with you, His desire being that no one should perish but that all should come to repentance.
30533	61	3	10	 The day of the Lord will come like a thief--it will be a day on which the heavens will pass away with a rushing noise, the elements be  destroyed in the fierce heat, and the earth and all the works of man be  utterly burnt up.
30534	61	3	11	  Since all these things are thus pre-destined to dissolution,  what sort of men ought you to be found to be in all holy living and godly conduct,
30535	61	3	12	  eagerly looking forward to the coming of the day of God, by reason of which the heavens, all ablaze,  will be destroyed, and the elements will melt in the fierce heat?
30536	61	3	13	 But in accordance with His promise we are expecting  new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness will  dwell.
30537	61	3	14	 Therefore, dear friends, since you have these expectations, earnestly seek to be found in His presence, free from blemish or reproach, in peace.
30538	61	3	15	 And  always regard the patient forbearance of our Lord as salvation, as our dear brother Paul also has written to you in virtue of the wisdom granted to him.
30539	61	3	16	 That is what he says in all his letters, when speaking in them of these things. In those letters there are some statements hard to understand, which ill-taught and unprincipled people pervert, just as they do the rest of the Scriptures, to their own ruin.
30540	61	3	17	 You, therefore, dear friends, having been warned beforehand, must  continually be on your guard so as not to be led astray by the false teaching of immoral men nor fall from your own stedfastness.
30541	61	3	18	 But be  always growing in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To Him be all glory, both now and to the day  of Eternity!
30542	62	1	1	 That which was from the beginning, which  we have listened to, which  we have seen with our own eyes, and our own hands have handled concerning the Word of Life--
30543	62	1	2	 the Life was manifested, and we have seen and bear witness, and we declare unto you the Life of the Ages which was with the Father and was manifested to us--
30544	62	1	3	 that which we have seen and listened to we now announce to you also, in order that you also may have fellowship in it with us, and this fellowship with us is fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.
30545	62	1	4	 And we write these things in order that our joy may be made complete.
30546	62	1	5	 This is the  Message which we have heard from the Lord Jesus and  now deliver to you--God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness.
30547	62	1	6	 If, while we are living in darkness, we profess to have fellowship with Him, we speak falsely and are not adhering to the truth.
30548	62	1	7	 But if we live in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, His Son, cleanses us from all sin.
30549	62	1	8	 If we claim to be already free from sin, we lead ourselves astray and the truth has no place in our hearts.
30550	62	1	9	 If we confess our sins, He is so  faithful and just that He forgives us our sins and cleanses us from all unrighteousness.
30551	62	1	10	 If we deny that we have sinned, we make Him a liar, and His Message has no place in our hearts.
30552	62	2	1	  Dear children, I write thus to you in order that you may not sin. If any one sins, we have an Advocate with the Father--Jesus Christ the righteous;
30553	62	2	2	 and He is an atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for  the sins of the whole world.
30554	62	2	3	 And by this we may know that we know Him--if we obey His commands.
30555	62	2	4	 He who professes to know Him, and yet does not obey His commands, is a liar, and the truth has no place in his heart.
30556	62	2	5	 But whoever obeys His Message, in him love for God has in very deed reached perfection. By this we can know that we are in Him.
30557	62	2	6	 The man who professes to be continuing in Him is himself also bound to live as He lived.
30558	62	2	7	 My dearly-loved friends, it is no new command that I am now giving you, but an old command which you have had from the very beginning. By the old command I mean the teaching which you have already received.
30559	62	2	8	 And yet I *am* giving you a new command, for such it really is, so far as both He and you are concerned: because  the darkness is now passing away and the light, the true light, is already beginning to shine.
30560	62	2	9	 Any one who professes to be in the light and yet hates his  brother man is still in darkness.
30561	62	2	10	 He who loves his brother man continues in the light, and  his life puts no stumbling-block in the way of others.
30562	62	2	11	 But he who hates his brother man is in darkness and is walking in darkness; and he does not know where he is going--because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
30563	62	2	12	 I am writing to you, dear children, because for His sake your sins are forgiven you.
30564	62	2	13	 I am writing to you, fathers, because you know Him who has existed from the very beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the Evil one. I have written to you, children, because you know the Father.
30565	62	2	14	 I have written to you, fathers, because you know Him who has existed from the very beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong and God's Message still has a place in your hearts, and you have overcome the Evil one.
30566	62	2	15	  Do not love the world, nor the things in the world. If any one loves the world, there is no love in his heart for the Father.
30567	62	2	16	 For the things in the world--the cravings of the earthly nature, the cravings of the eyes, the show and pride of life--they all come, not from the Father, but from the world.
30568	62	2	17	 And the world, with its cravings, is passing away, but he who does God's will continues  for ever.
30569	62	2	18	 Dear children,  the last hour has come; and as you once heard that there was to be  an anti-Christ, so even now many anti-Christs have appeared. By this we may know that the last hour has come.
30570	62	2	19	 They have gone forth from our midst, but they did not really belong to us; for had they belonged to us, they would have remained with us. But they left us that it might be manifest that  professed believers do not all belong to us.
30571	62	2	20	 As for you, you have an anointing from the holy One  and have perfect knowledge.
30572	62	2	21	 I have written to you, not because you are ignorant of the truth, but because you know it, and you know that nothing false comes from the truth.
30573	62	2	22	 Who is  a liar compared with  him who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He who disowns the Father and the Son  is the anti-Christ.
30574	62	2	23	 No one who disowns the Son has the Father. He who acknowledges the Son has also the Father.
30575	62	2	24	 As for you, let the teaching which you have received from the very beginning continue in your hearts. If that teaching does continue in your hearts, you also will continue to be in union with the Son and with the Father.
30576	62	2	25	 And this is the promise which He Himself has given us--the Life of the Ages.
30577	62	2	26	 I have thus written to you concerning those who are leading you astray.
30578	62	2	27	 And as for you, the anointing which you received from Him remains within you, and there is no need for any one to teach you. But since His anointing gives you instruction in all things--and is true and is no falsehood--you are continuing in union with Him even as it has taught you to do.
30579	62	2	28	 And now, dear children, continue in union with Him; so that,  if He re-appears, we may have perfect confidence, and may not shrink away in shame from His presence at His Coming.
30580	62	2	29	 Since you know that He is righteous, be assured also that the man who habitually acts righteously is  a child of His.
30581	62	3	1	 See  what marvellous love the Father has bestowed upon us--that we should be called God's children: and that is what we are. For this reason the world does not recognize us--because it has not known Him.
30582	62	3	2	 Dear friends, we are now God's children, but what we are to be in the future has not yet been fully revealed. We know that  if Christ reappears we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him as He is.
30583	62	3	3	 And every man who has this hope fixed on Him, purifies himself so as to be as pure as He is.
30584	62	3	4	 Every one who is guilty of sin is also guilty of violating Law; for sin is the violation of Law.
30585	62	3	5	 And you know that He  appeared in order  to take away sins; and in Him there is no sin.
30586	62	3	6	 No one who continues in union with Him  lives in sin: no one who lives in sin has seen Him or knows Him.
30587	62	3	7	 Dear children, let no one lead you astray. The man who acts righteously is righteous, just as He is righteous.
30588	62	3	8	 He who is  habitually guilty of sin  is a child of the Devil, because the Devil has been a sinner from the very beginning. The Son of God  appeared for the purpose of undoing the work of the Devil.
30589	62	3	9	 No one who is a child of God is  habitually guilty of sin. A God-given germ of life remains in him, and he  cannot  habitually sin--because he is a child of God.
30590	62	3	10	 By this we can distinguish God's children and the Devil's children: no one who fails to act righteously is a child of God, nor he who does not love his brother man.
30591	62	3	11	 For this is the Message you have heard from the beginning--that we are to love one another.
30592	62	3	12	 We are not to resemble Cain, who was a child of the Evil one and killed his own brother. And why did he kill him? Because his own actions were wicked and his brother's actions righteous.
30593	62	3	13	 Do not be surprised, brethren, if the world hates you.
30594	62	3	14	 As for us, we know that we have already passed out of death into Life--because we love our brother men. He who is destitute of love  continues dead.
30595	62	3	15	 Every one who hates his brother man is a murderer; and you know that no murderer has the Life of the Ages continuing in him.
30596	62	3	16	 We know what love is--through Christ's having laid down His life on our behalf; and in the same way we ought to lay down our lives for our brother men.
30597	62	3	17	 But if any one has this world's wealth and sees that his brother man is in need, and yet hardens his heart against him--how can such a one continue to love God?
30598	62	3	18	 Dear children, let us not love in words only nor with the lips, but in deed and in truth.
30599	62	3	19	 And in this way we shall come to know that we are loyal to the truth, and shall  satisfy our  consciences in His presence
30600	62	3	20	 in whatever matters our hearts condemn us--because God is greater than our hearts and knows everything.
30601	62	3	21	 Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have perfect confidence towards God;
30602	62	3	22	 and whatever we ask for we obtain from Him, because we obey His commands and do the things which are pleasing in His sight.
30603	62	3	23	 And this is His command--that we are to  believe in His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as He has commanded us to do.
30604	62	3	24	 The man who obeys His commands continues in union with God, and God continues in union with him; and through His Spirit whom He has given us we can know that He continues in union with us.
30605	62	4	1	 Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but put the spirits to the test to see whether they are from God; for many false teachers have gone out into the world.
30606	62	4	2	 The test by which you may recognize the Spirit of God is that every spirit which acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come as man is from God,
30607	62	4	3	 and that no spirit is from God which does not acknowledge this about Jesus. Such is the spirit of the anti-Christ; of whose coming you  have heard, and it is already in the world.
30608	62	4	4	 As for you, dear children, you are God's children, and have successfully resisted  them; for greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.
30609	62	4	5	 They are the world's children, and so their language is that of the world, and the world listens to them. We are God's children.
30610	62	4	6	 The man who is beginning to know God listens to us, but he who is not a child of God does not listen to us. By this test we can distinguish the Spirit of truth from the spirit of error.
30611	62	4	7	 Dear friends, let us love one another; for love has its origin in God, and every one who loves has become a child of God and is beginning to know God.
30612	62	4	8	 He who is destitute of love has never had any knowledge of God; because God is love.
30613	62	4	9	 God's love for us  has been manifested in that He  has sent His  only Son into the world so that we may have Life through Him.
30614	62	4	10	 This is love indeed--we did not love God, but He loved us and sent His Son to be an atoning sacrifice for our sins.
30615	62	4	11	 Dear friends, if God has so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
30616	62	4	12	  No one has ever yet seen God. If we love one another, God continues in union with us, and His love in all its perfection is in our hearts.
30617	62	4	13	 We can know that we are continuing in union with Him and that He is continuing in union with us, by the fact that He has given us a portion of His Spirit.
30618	62	4	14	 And we have seen and bear witness that the Father has sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.
30619	62	4	15	 Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God--God continues in union with him, and he continues in union with God.
30620	62	4	16	 And, as for us, we know the love which God has for us, and we confide in it. God is love, and he who continues to love continues in union with God, and God continues in union with him.
30621	62	4	17	 Our love will be manifested in all its perfection by our having complete confidence on the day of the Judgement; because just  what He is, we also are in the world.
30622	62	4	18	 Love has in it no element of fear; but  perfect love drives away fear, because fear involves pain, and if a man gives way to fear, there is something imperfect in his love.
30623	62	4	19	  We love because God first loved us.
30624	62	4	20	 If any one says that he loves God, while he hates his brother man, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother man whom he has seen,  cannot love God whom he has not seen.
30625	62	4	21	 And the command which we have from Him is that he who loves God must love his brother man also.
30626	62	5	1	 Every one who believes that  Jesus is the Christ  is a child of God; and every one who loves the Father loves also Him who is the Father's Child.
30627	62	5	2	 The fact that we love God Himself, and obey His commands, is a proof that we love God's children.
30628	62	5	3	 Love for God means obedience to His commands; and His commands are not irksome.
30629	62	5	4	 For  every child of God overcomes the world; and the victorious principle which has overcome the world is our faith.
30630	62	5	5	 Who but the man that believes that Jesus is the Son of God overcomes the world?
30631	62	5	6	 Jesus Christ is He who came  with water and blood; not with the water only, but  with the water and with the blood. And it is the Spirit who gives testimony--  because the Spirit is the Truth.
30632	62	5	7	 For there are  three that give testimony--  the Spirit, the water, and the blood;
30633	62	5	8	 and there is complete agreement between  these three.
30634	62	5	9	 If we accept the testimony of men, God's testimony is greater: for God's testimony consists of the things which He has testified about His Son.
30635	62	5	10	 He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in his own heart: he who does not believe God has made Him a liar, in that he has refused to accept the testimony which God has given about His Son.
30636	62	5	11	 And that testimony is to the effect that God has given us the Life of the Ages, and that this Life is in His Son.
30637	62	5	12	 He who has the Son has the Life: he who has not the Son of God has not the Life.
30638	62	5	13	 I write all this to you in order that you who believe in the Son of God may know for certain that you already have the Life of the Ages.
30639	62	5	14	 And we have an assured confidence that whenever we ask anything in accordance with His will, He listens to us.
30640	62	5	15	 And since we know that He listens to us, then whatever we ask, we know that we have the things which we have asked from Him.
30641	62	5	16	 If any one sees a brother man committing a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask and God shall give him life--for those who do not sin unto death. There is such a thing as sin unto death; for that I do not bid him make request.
30642	62	5	17	 Any kind of wrongdoing is sin; but there is sin which is not unto death.
30643	62	5	18	 We know that no one who is a child of God lives in sin,  but He who is God's Child keeps him, and the Evil one cannot touch him.
30644	62	5	19	 We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world lies  in the power of the Evil one.
30645	62	5	20	 And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we know the true One, and are in union with the true One--that is, we are in union with His Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and the Life of the Ages.
30646	62	5	21	 Dear children, guard yourselves from idols.
30647	63	1	1	 The Elder  to the elect lady and her children. Truly I love you all, and not I alone, but also all who know the truth,
30648	63	1	2	 for the sake of the truth which is continually in our hearts and will be with us  for ever.
30649	63	1	3	 Grace, mercy and peace will be with us from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
30650	63	1	4	  It is an intense joy to me to have found  some of your children living true Christian lives, in obedience to the command which we have received from the Father.
30651	63	1	5	 And now, dear lady, I pray you--writing to you, as I do, not a new command, but the one which  we have had from the very beginning--let us love one another.
30652	63	1	6	 The love of which I am speaking consists in our living in obedience to God's commands. God's command is that you should live in obedience to what you all heard from the very beginning.
30653	63	1	7	 For many deceivers have gone out into the world--men who do not acknowledge Jesus as Christ who has come in human nature.  Such a one is `the deceiver' and `the anti-Christ.'
30654	63	1	8	 Keep guard over yourselves, so that you may not lose the results of your good deeds, but may receive back a full reward.
30655	63	1	9	  No one has God, who instead of remaining true to the  teaching of Christ, presses on in advance: but he who remains true to that teaching has both the Father and the Son.
30656	63	1	10	 If any one who comes to you does not bring this teaching, do not receive him under your roof nor  bid him Farewell.
30657	63	1	11	 He who bids him Farewell is a sharer in his evil deeds.
30658	63	1	12	 I have a great deal to say to you all, but will not write it with paper and ink. Yet I hope to come to see you and speak face to face, so that your happiness may be complete.
30659	63	1	13	 The children of your elect sister send greetings to you.
30660	64	1	1	 The Elder to his dear friend Gaius. Truly I love you.
30661	64	1	2	 My dear friend, I pray that you may in all respects prosper and enjoy good health, just as your soul already prospers.
30662	64	1	3	 For  it is an intense joy to me when brethren come and bear witness to your fidelity to the truth--that you live in obedience to the truth.
30663	64	1	4	 I have no greater  joy than to hear that my children are  living in obedience to the truth.
30664	64	1	5	 My dear friend, you are acting faithfully in all your behaviour towards the brethren, even when they are strangers to you.
30665	64	1	6	 They have testified, in the presence of the Church, to your love; and you will do well to help them on their journey  in a manner worthy of your fellowship with God.
30666	64	1	7	 For it is for Christ that they have gone forth, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.
30667	64	1	8	 It is therefore our duty to show hospitality to such men, so that we may be fellow workers in promoting the truth.
30668	64	1	9	  I wrote to the Church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the first place among them, refuses to listen to us.
30669	64	1	10	 For this reason, if I come, I shall not forget his conduct, nor his idle and mischievous talk against us. And he does not stop there: he not only will not receive the brethren, but those who desire to do this he hinders, and excludes them from the Church.
30670	64	1	11	 My dear friend, do not follow wrong examples, but right ones. He who habitually does what is right is a child of God: he who habitually does what is wrong has not seen God.
30671	64	1	12	 The character of Demetrius has the approval of all men, and of the truth itself. We also express our approval of it, and you know that we only give our approval to that which is true.
30672	64	1	13	 I have a great deal to say to you, but I do not wish to go on writing it with ink and pen.
30673	64	1	14	 But I hope to see you very soon, and then we will speak face to face. Peace be with you. Our friends send greetings to you. Greet our friends individually.
30674	64	1	15	 []
30675	65	1	1	  Jude, a bondservant of Jesus Christ and  a brother of James: To those who are  in God the Father,  enfolded in His love, and kept for Jesus Christ, and called.
30676	65	1	2	  May mercy, peace and love be abundantly granted to you.
30677	65	1	3	 Dear friends, since I am eager  to begin a letter to you on the subject of  our common salvation, I find myself constrained  to write and cheer you on to the vigorous defense of the faith delivered once for all to God's people.
30678	65	1	4	  For  certain persons have crept in unnoticed--men spoken of in ancient writings as pre-destined to this condemnation--ungodly men, who pervert the grace of our God into an excuse for immorality, and disown Jesus Christ, our only Sovereign and Lord.
30679	65	1	5	  I desire to remind you--although the whole matter is already familiar to you--that the Lord saved a people out of the land of Egypt, but  afterwards destroyed those who  had no faith.
30680	65	1	6	  And angels--those who  did not keep the position originally assigned to them, but deserted their own proper abode--He reserves in everlasting bonds, in darkness, in preparation for the judgement of the great day.
30681	65	1	7	  So also Sodom and Gomorrah--and the neighboring towns in the same manner--having been guilty of gross fornication and having gone astray in pursuit of unnatural vice, are now before us as a specimen of the fire of the Ages in the punishment which they are undergoing.
30682	65	1	8	  Yet in just the same way  these dreamers also  pollute the body, while they set authority at naught and speak evil of dignities.
30683	65	1	9	  But Michael the Archangel, when contending with the Devil and arguing with him about the body of Moses, did not dare to pronounce judgement on him in abusive terms, but simply said, "The Lord rebuke you."
30684	65	1	10	  Yet these men are abusive in matters of which they know nothing, and in things which, like the brutes, they understand instinctively--in all these  they corrupt themselves.
30685	65	1	11	  Alas for them; for they have followed in the steps of Cain; for the sake of gain they have rushed on headlong in the evil ways of Balaam; and have perished in  rebellion like that of  Korah!
30686	65	1	12	  These men--sunken rocks! --are those who share the pleasure of your love-feasts, unrestrained by fear while caring only for themselves; clouds without water, driven away by the winds; trees that cast their fruit, barren, doubly dead, uprooted;
30687	65	1	13	  wild waves of the sea,  foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom is reserved dense darkness of age-long duration.
30688	65	1	14	  It was also about these that Enoch, who belonged to the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied, saying, "The Lord  has come, attended by myriads of His people, to execute judgement upon all,
30689	65	1	15	 and to convict all the ungodly of all the ungodly deeds which in their ungodliness they have committed, and of all the hard words which they, ungodly sinners as they are, have spoken against Him."
30690	65	1	16	  These men are murmurers, ever bemoaning their lot. Their lives are guided by their evil passions, and their mouths are full of  big, boastful words,  while they treat  individual men with admiring reverence for the sake of the advantage they can gain.
30691	65	1	17	  But as for you, my dearly-loved friends, remember the words that before now were spoken by the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ--
30692	65	1	18	  how they declared to you, "In the last times there shall be scoffers,  obeying only their own ungodly passions."
30693	65	1	19	  These are those who cause divisions. They are  men of the world,  wholly unspiritual.
30694	65	1	20	  But you, my dearly-loved friends, building yourselves up on the basis of your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit,
30695	65	1	21	  must keep yourselves safe in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ which will result in the Life of the Ages.
30696	65	1	22	  Some, when they argue with you, you must  endeavor to convince;
30697	65	1	23	  others you must  try to save, as brands plucked  from the flames; and on others look with pity mingled with fear,  while you hate every trace of their sin.
30698	65	1	24	   But to Him who is able to keep you safe from stumbling, and cause you to stand in the presence of His glory free from blemish and full of exultant joy--
30699	65	1	25	 to the only God our Saviour--through Jesus Christ our Lord, be ascribed glory, majesty, might, and authority, as it was before all time, is now, and shall be to all the Ages! Amen.
30700	66	1	1	  The revelation  given by Jesus Christ, which God granted Him, that He might make known to His  servants certain events which must  shortly come to pass: and He sent His angel and communicated it to His  servant John.
30701	66	1	2	 This is the John who taught the truth concerning the Word of God and  the truth told us by Jesus Christ--  a faithful account of what he had seen.
30702	66	1	3	 Blessed is he who  reads and blessed are those who listen to the words of this prophecy and lay to heart what is written in it; for  the time for its fulfillment is now close at hand.
30703	66	1	4	 John sends greetings to the seven Churches in  the province of Asia. May grace be granted to you, and peace, from Him who is and was and  evermore will be; and from  the seven Spirits which are before His throne;
30704	66	1	5	 and from Jesus Christ, the truthful witness, the first of the dead to be born to Life, and the Ruler of the kings of the  earth. To Him who loves us and has freed us from our sins with His own blood,
30705	66	1	6	 and has  formed us into a Kingdom, to be priests to  God, His Father--to Him be ascribed the glory and the power until the Ages  of the Ages. Amen.
30706	66	1	7	  He is coming in the clouds, and  every eye will see Him, and  so will those who pierced Him; and all the  nations of the earth will gaze on Him and mourn. Even so. Amen.
30707	66	1	8	 "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "He who is and was and  evermore will be--the Ruler of all."
30708	66	1	9	 I John, your brother, and a sharer with you in the sorrows and Kingship and patient endurance of Jesus, found myself in the island of Patmos, on account of the Word of God and the truth told us by Jesus.
30709	66	1	10	 In the Spirit I found myself present on  the day of the Lord, and I heard behind me a loud voice which resembled the blast of a trumpet.
30710	66	1	11	 It said, "Write forthwith in  a roll an account of what you see, and send it to the seven Churches--to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyateira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea."
30711	66	1	12	 I turned to see  who it was that was speaking to me; and  then I saw  seven golden lampstands,
30712	66	1	13	 and in the center of the lampstands some One resembling the Son of Man, clothed in a robe which reached to His feet, and with a girdle of gold across His breast.
30713	66	1	14	 His head and His hair were white, like white wool--as white as snow; and His eyes resembled a flame of fire.
30714	66	1	15	 His feet were like silver-bronze, when it is  white-hot in a furnace; and His voice resembled the sound of many waters.
30715	66	1	16	 In His right hand He held seven stars, and a sharp, two-edged sword  was seen coming from His mouth; and His glance resembled the sun when it is shining with its full strength.
30716	66	1	17	 When I saw Him, I fell at His feet as if I were dead. But He laid His right hand upon me and said, "Do not be afraid: I am the First and the Last, and the ever-living One.
30717	66	1	18	 I died; but I am now alive until the Ages of the Ages, and I have  the keys of the gates of Death and of Hades!
30718	66	1	19	 Write down therefore the things you have just seen, and those which are now taking place, and those which are soon to follow:
30719	66	1	20	 the secret meaning of the seven stars which you have seen in My right hand, and of the seven lampstands of gold. The seven stars are the  ministers of  the seven Churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven Churches.
30720	66	2	1	 "To the  minister of the Church in Ephesus write as follows: "`This is what He who holds the seven stars in the grasp of His right hand says--He who walks to and fro among the seven lampstands of gold.
30721	66	2	2	 I know your doings and your toil and patient suffering. And I know that you cannot tolerate wicked men, but have put to the test those who say that they themselves are Apostles but are not, and you have found them to be liars.
30722	66	2	3	 And you endure patiently and have borne burdens for My sake and have never grown weary.
30723	66	2	4	 Yet I have this against you--that  you no longer love Me as you did at first.
30724	66	2	5	 Be mindful, therefore, of the height from which you have fallen. Repent at once, and act as you did at first, or else I will surely come and remove your lampstand out of its place--unless you repent.
30725	66	2	6	 Yet this you have in your favor: you hate the doings of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
30726	66	2	7	 "`Let all who have ears give heed to what the Spirit is saying to the Churches. To him who overcomes I will give the privilege of eating the fruit of the  Tree of Life, which is in the Paradise of God.'
30727	66	2	8	 "To the minister of the Church at Smyrna write as follows: "`This is what the First and the Last says--He who  died and has returned to life.
30728	66	2	9	 Your sufferings I know, and your poverty--but you are rich--and the evil name given you by those who say that they themselves are Jews, and are not, but are Satan's synagogue.
30729	66	2	10	 Dismiss your fears concerning all that you are about to suffer. I tell you that the Devil is about to throw some of you into prison that you may be put to the test, and for ten days you will have to  endure persecution.  Be faithful to the End,  even if you have to die, and then I will give you the victor's Wreath of Life.
30730	66	2	11	 "`Let all who have ears give heed to what the Spirit is saying to the Churches. He who overcomes shall be in no way hurt by  the Second Death.'
30731	66	2	12	 "To the minister of the Church at Pergamum write as follows: "`This is what He who has the sharp, two-edged sword says. I know where you dwell.
30732	66	2	13	  Satan's throne is there; and yet  you are true to Me, and did not deny your faith in Me, even in the days of Antipas My witness and faithful friend, who was put to death among you, in the place where Satan dwells.
30733	66	2	14	 Yet I have a few things against you, because you have  with you some that cling to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling-block in the way of the descendants of Israel--to eat what had been sacrificed to idols, and commit fornication.
30734	66	2	15	 So even you have some that cling in the same way to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
30735	66	2	16	 Repent, at once; or else I will come to you quickly, and will make war upon them with the sword which is in My mouth.
30736	66	2	17	 "`Let all who have ears give heed to what the Spirit is saying to the Churches. He who overcomes--to him I will give some of the  hidden Manna, and a white stone; and--written upon the stone and known only to him who receives it--  a new name.'
30737	66	2	18	 "To the minister of the Church at Thyateira write as follows: "`This is what the Son of God says--He who has eyes like a flame of fire, and feet resembling silver-bronze.
30738	66	2	19	 I know your doings, your love, your faith, your service, and  your patient endurance; and that  of late you have toiled harder than you did at first.
30739	66	2	20	 Yet I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and by her teaching leads astray My servants, so that they commit fornication and eat what has been sacrificed to idols.
30740	66	2	21	 I have given her time to repent, but she is determined not to repent of her fornication.
30741	66	2	22	 I tell you that I am about to cast her upon a bed of sickness, and I will severely afflict those who commit adultery with her, unless they repent of conduct such as hers.
30742	66	2	23	 Her children too shall surely die; and all the Churches shall come to know that I am He who searches into men's inmost thoughts; and to each of you I will give a requital which shall be in accordance with what your conduct has been.
30743	66	2	24	 But to you, the rest of you in Thyateira, all who do not hold this teaching and are not the people who have learnt the "deep things," as they call them (the deep things of Satan!) --to you I say that I lay no other burden on you.
30744	66	2	25	 Only that which you already possess, cling to  until I come.
30745	66	2	26	 "`And to him who overcomes and obeys My commands to the very end, I will give  authority over the nations of the earth.
30746	66	2	27	 And he shall be their shepherd, ruling them with a  rod of iron, just as earthenware jars are broken to pieces; and his power over them shall be like that which I Myself have received from My Father;
30747	66	2	28	 and I will give him  the Morning Star.
30748	66	2	29	 Let all who have ears give heed to what the Spirit is saying to the Churches.'

30750	66	3	2	 Rouse yourself and keep awake, and strengthen those things which remain but have well-nigh perished; for I have found no doings of yours free from imperfection in the sight of My God.
30751	66	3	3	 Be mindful, therefore, of the lessons you have received and heard. Continually lay them to heart, and repent. If, however, you fail to rouse yourself and keep awake, I shall come upon you suddenly like a thief, and you will certainly not know the hour at which I shall come to judge you.
30752	66	3	4	 Yet you have in Sardis a few who have not soiled their garments; and they shall walk with Me in white; for they are worthy.
30753	66	3	5	 "`In this way he who overcomes shall be clothed in  white garments; and I will certainly not blot out his name from the  Book of Life, but will  acknowledge him in the presence of My Father and His angels.

30755	66	3	7	 "To the minister of the Church at Philadelphia write as follows: "`This is what the holy One and the true says--He who has the key of David--He who opens and no one shall shut, and shuts and no one shall open.
30756	66	3	8	 I know your doings. I have  put an opened door in front of you, which no one can  shut; because you have but a little power, and yet you have guarded My word and have not disowned Me.
30757	66	3	9	 I will cause some belonging to Satan's synagogue who say that they themselves are Jews, and are not, but are liars--I will make them come and fall at your feet and know for certain that I have loved you.
30758	66	3	10	 Because  in spite of suffering you have guarded My word, I in turn will guard you from that hour of trial which is soon coming upon the whole world, to put to the test  the inhabitants of the  earth.

30761	66	3	13	 Let all who have ears give heed to what the Spirit is saying to the Churches.'
30762	66	3	14	 "And to the minister of the Church at Laodicea write as follows: "`This is what the Amen says--the  true and faithful witness, the Beginning and Lord of God's Creation.
30763	66	3	15	 I know your doings--you are neither cold nor hot; I would that you were cold or hot!
30764	66	3	16	 Accordingly, because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, before long I will vomit you out of My mouth.
30765	66	3	17	 You say, I am rich, and have wealth stored up, and I stand in need of nothing; and you do not know that if there is a wretched creature it is *you* --  pitiable, poor, blind, naked.
30766	66	3	18	 Therefore I counsel you to buy of Me gold refined in the fire that you may become rich, and white robes to put on, so as to hide your shameful nakedness, and eye-salve to anoint your eyes with, so that you may be able to see.
30767	66	3	19	  All whom I hold dear, I reprove and chastise; therefore be in earnest and repent.
30768	66	3	20	 I am now standing at the door and am knocking. If any one listens to My voice and opens the door, I will go in to be with him and will feast with him, and he shall feast with Me.

30771	66	4	1	 After all this I looked and saw a door in Heaven standing open, and the voice that I had previously heard, which resembled the blast of a trumpet, again spoke to me and said, "Come up here, and I will show you things which are to happen in the future."
30772	66	4	2	 Immediately I found myself in the Spirit, and  saw a throne in Heaven, and some One sitting on the throne.
30773	66	4	3	 The appearance of Him who sat there was like  jasper or sard; and encircling the throne was a  rainbow, in appearance like an emerald.
30774	66	4	4	 Surrounding the throne there were also twenty-four other thrones, on which sat  twenty-four Elders clothed in white robes, with victors' wreaths of gold upon their heads.
30775	66	4	5	 Out from the throne  there came flashes of lightning, and voices, and peals of thunder, while in front of the throne seven blazing lamps were burning, which are the seven Spirits of God.
30776	66	4	6	 And in front of the throne there seemed to be a  sea of glass, resembling crystal. And  midway between the throne and the Elders, and surrounding the throne, were  four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind.
30777	66	4	7	 The first living creature resembled a lion, the second an ox, the third had a face like that of a man, and the fourth resembled an eagle flying.
30778	66	4	8	 And each of the four living creatures had six wings, and in every direction, and within, are full of eyes; and day after day, and night after night, they never cease saying,  "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God, the Ruler of all, who wast and art and  evermore shalt be."
30779	66	4	9	 And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who is seated on the throne, and lives until the Ages of the Ages,
30780	66	4	10	 the twenty-four Elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and worship Him who lives until the Ages of the Ages, and they cast their wreaths down in front of the throne,
30781	66	4	11	 saying, "It is fitting, O our Lord and God, That we should ascribe unto Thee the glory and the honor and the power; For Thou didst create all things, And because it was Thy will they came into existence, and were created."
30782	66	5	1	 And I saw  lying in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne  a book  written on both sides and closely sealed with seven seals.
30783	66	5	2	 And I saw a mighty angel who was exclaiming in a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book and break its seals?"
30784	66	5	3	 But no one in Heaven, or on earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book or look into it.
30785	66	5	4	 And while I was  weeping bitterly, because no one was found worthy to open the book or look into it,
30786	66	5	5	 one of the Elders said to me,  "Do not weep. The Lion which belongs to the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed, and will open the book and break its seven seals."
30787	66	5	6	 Then,  midway between the throne and the four living creatures, I saw  a Lamb standing among the Elders. He looked as if He had been offered in sacrifice, and He had seven horns and seven eyes. The last-named are the seven Spirits of God, and  have been sent far and wide into all the  earth.
30788	66	5	7	 So He comes, and now He has taken the book out of the right hand of Him who is seated on the throne.
30789	66	5	8	 And when He had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four Elders fell down before the Lamb, having each of them a harp and bringing golden bowls full of incense, which represent the prayers of God's people.
30790	66	5	9	 And now they sing a new song. "It is fitting," they say, "that Thou shouldst be the One to take the book And break its seals; Because Thou hast been offered in sacrifice, And hast purchased for God with Thine own blood Some out of every tribe and language and people and nation,
30791	66	5	10	 And hast formed them into a Kingdom to be priests to our God, And they  reign over the earth."
30792	66	5	11	 And I looked, and heard  what seemed to be the voices of countless angels on every side of the throne, and of the living creatures and the Elders. Their number was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands,
30793	66	5	12	 and in loud voices they were singing, "It is fitting that the Lamb which has been offered in sacrifice should receive all power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing."
30794	66	5	13	 And as for every created thing in Heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and everything that was in any of these, I heard them say, "To Him who is seated on the throne, And to the Lamb, Be ascribed all blessing and honor And glory and might, Until the Ages of the Ages!"
30795	66	5	14	 Then the four living creatures said "Amen," and the Elders fell down and  worshipped.
30796	66	6	1	 And when the Lamb broke one of the seven seals I saw it, and I heard  one of the four living creatures say, as if in a voice of thunder,  "Come."
30797	66	6	2	 And I looked and a white horse appeared, and its  rider carried a bow; and a victor's wreath was given to him; and he went out conquering and in order to conquer.
30798	66	6	3	 And when the Lamb broke the second seal, I heard  the second living creature say, "Come."
30799	66	6	4	 And another horse came out--a  fiery-red one; and power was given to its rider to take peace from the  earth, and to cause men to  kill one another; and a great  sword was given to him.
30800	66	6	5	 When the Lamb broke the third seal, I heard  the third living creature say, "Come." I looked, and a black horse appeared, its rider carrying a balance in his hand.
30801	66	6	6	 And I heard what seemed to be a voice speaking in the midst of the four living creatures, and saying,  "A quart of wheat for a shilling, and three quarts of barley for a shilling; but do not injure either  the oil or the wine."
30802	66	6	7	 When the Lamb broke the fourth seal I heard  the voice of the  fourth living creature say, "Come."
30803	66	6	8	 I looked and a pale-colored horse appeared. Its rider's name was  Death, and Hades came close behind him; and authority was given to them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with the sword or with famine or pestilence or by means of the wild beasts of the earth.
30804	66	6	9	 When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw at the foot of the altar  the souls of those whose lives had been sacrificed because of the word of God and of the testimony which they had given.
30805	66	6	10	 And  now in loud voices they cried out, saying, "How long, O Sovereign Lord, the holy One and the true, dost Thou delay judgment and the taking of vengeance upon the  inhabitants of the earth for our blood?"
30806	66	6	11	 And there was given to each of them a long white robe, and they were bidden to wait patiently for a short time longer, until the full number of their fellow bondservants should also complete--namely of their brethren who were soon to be killed just as they had been.
30807	66	6	12	  When the Lamb broke the sixth seal I looked, and there was a great earthquake, and the sun became as dark as sackcloth, and the whole disc of the moon became like blood.
30808	66	6	13	 The stars in the sky also fell to the earth, as when a fig-tree, upon being shaken by a gale of wind, casts its  unripe figs to the ground.
30809	66	6	14	 The sky too passed away, as if a scroll were being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.
30810	66	6	15	  The kings of the earth and the great men, the military chiefs, the wealthy and the powerful--all, whether slaves or free men--hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains,
30811	66	6	16	 while they called to the mountains and the rocks, saying, "Fall on us and hide us from the presence of Him who sits on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb;
30812	66	6	17	 for the day of His anger--that great day--has come, and who is able to stand?"
30813	66	7	1	 After this I saw four angels standing  at the four corners of the  earth, and holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind should blow over the earth or the sea or upon any tree.
30814	66	7	2	 And I saw another angel  coming from the east and carrying a seal belonging to the  ever-living God. He called in a loud voice to the four angels whose work it was to injure the earth and the sea.
30815	66	7	3	  "Injure neither land nor sea nor trees," he said, "until we have sealed the bondservants of our God upon their foreheads."
30816	66	7	4	 When the sealing was finished, I heard how many were sealed out of the tribes of the descendants of Israel. They were 144,000.
30817	66	7	5	 Of the tribe of Judah, 12,000 were sealed; Of the tribe of Reuben, 12,000; Of the tribe of Gad, 12,000;
30818	66	7	6	 Of the tribe of Asher, 12,000; Of the tribe of Naphtali, 12,000; Of the tribe of Manasseh, 12,000;
30819	66	7	7	 Of the tribe of Symeon, 12,000; Of the tribe of Levi, 12,000; Of the tribe of Issachar, 12,000;
30820	66	7	8	 Of the tribe of Zebulun, 12,000; Of the tribe of Joseph, 12,000; Of the tribe of Benjamin, 12,000.
30821	66	7	9	 After this I looked, and a vast host appeared which it was impossible for anyone to  count, gathered out of every nation and from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in long white robes, and carrying palm-branches in their hands.
30822	66	7	10	 In loud voices they were exclaiming, "It is to our God who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb, that we owe our salvation!"
30823	66	7	11	  All the angels were standing in a circle round the throne and round the Elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces in front of the throne and worshipped God.
30824	66	7	12	 "Even so!" they cried: "The blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanks and the honor and the power and the might are to be ascribed to our God, until the Ages of the Ages! Even so!"
30825	66	7	13	 Then, addressing me, one of the Elders said, "Who are these people clothed in the long white robes? And where have they come from?"
30826	66	7	14	 "My lord, you know," I replied. "They are those," he said, "who  have just passed through  the great distress, and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
30827	66	7	15	 For this reason they stand before the very throne of God, and render Him service, day after day and night after night, in His sanctuary, and He who is sitting upon the throne will shelter them in His tent.
30828	66	7	16	 They will never again be hungry or thirsty, and never again will the sun or any scorching heat trouble them.
30829	66	7	17	 For the Lamb who is  in front of the throne will be their Shepherd, and will guide them to watersprings of Life, and God will wipe every tear from their eyes."
30830	66	8	1	 When the Lamb broke the seventh seal, there was  silence in Heaven for about half an hour.
30831	66	8	2	 Then I saw the seven angels who are in the presence of God, and  seven trumpets were given to them.
30832	66	8	3	 And another angel came and stood close to the altar, carrying a censer of gold; and abundance of incense was given to him that he might place it with the prayers of all God's people upon the golden altar which was in front of the throne.
30833	66	8	4	 And the smoke of the incense rose into the presence of God from the angel's hand, and mingled with the prayers of His people.
30834	66	8	5	  So the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and flung it to the earth; and there followed peals of thunder, and voices, and flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.
30835	66	8	6	 Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets made preparations for blowing them.
30836	66	8	7	  The first blew his trumpet; and there came hail and fire, mixed with blood, falling upon the earth; and a third part of the earth was burnt up, and a third part of the trees and all the green grass.
30837	66	8	8	  The second angel blew his trumpet; and what seemed to be a great mountain, all ablaze with fire, was hurled into the sea; and a third part of the sea was turned into blood.
30838	66	8	9	 And a third part of the creatures that were in the sea--those that had life--died; and a third part of the ships were destroyed.
30839	66	8	10	  The third angel blew his trumpet; and there fell from Heaven a great star, which was on fire like a torch. It fell upon a third part of the rivers and upon the springs of water.
30840	66	8	11	 The name of the star is `Wormwood;' and a third part of the waters were turned into wormwood, and vast numbers of the people died from drinking the water, because it had become bitter.
30841	66	8	12	  Then the fourth angel blew his trumpet; and a curse fell upon a third part of the sun, a third part of the moon, and a third part of the stars, so that a third part of them were darkened and for a third of the day, and also of the night, there was no light.
30842	66	8	13	 Then I looked, and I heard a solitary eagle crying in a loud voice, as it flew across the sky, "Alas, alas, alas, for the  inhabitants of the  earth, because of the significance of the remaining trumpets which the three angels are about to blow!"
30843	66	9	1	 The fifth angel blew his trumpet; and I saw  a Star which  had fallen from Heaven to the earth; and to him was given the key of the depths of the bottomless pit,
30844	66	9	2	 and he opened the depths of the bottomless pit. And smoke came up out of the pit resembling the smoke of a vast furnace, so that the sun was darkened, and the air also, by reason of the smoke of the pit.
30845	66	9	3	 And from the midst of the smoke there came  locusts on to the  earth, and power was given to them resembling the power which earthly scorpions possess.
30846	66	9	4	 And they were forbidden to injure the herbage of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree. They were only to injure human beings--those who have not the seal of God on their foreheads.
30847	66	9	5	 Their mission was not to kill, but to cause awful agony for  five months; and this agony was like that which a scorpion inflicts when it stings a man.
30848	66	9	6	 And at that time people will seek death, but will by no possibility find it, and will long to die, but death evades them.
30849	66	9	7	 The appearance of the locusts was like that of horses equipped for war. On their heads they had wreaths which looked like gold.
30850	66	9	8	 Their faces seemed human and  they had hair like women's hair, but their teeth resembled those of lions.
30851	66	9	9	 They had breast-plates which seemed to be made of steel; and the noise caused by their wings was like that of a vast number of horses and chariots hurrying into battle.
30852	66	9	10	 They had tails like those of scorpions, and also stings; and in their tails lay their power of injuring mankind for five months.
30853	66	9	11	 The locusts had  a king over them--the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in Hebrew is  `Abaddon,' while in the Greek he is called  `Apollyon.'
30854	66	9	12	 The first woe is past; two other woes have still to come.
30855	66	9	13	  The sixth angel blew his trumpet; and I heard a single voice speaking from among the horns of the golden incense altar which is in the presence of God.
30856	66	9	14	 It said to the sixth angel--the angel who had the trumpet, "Set at liberty the four angels who are prisoners near the great river Euphrates."
30857	66	9	15	 And the four angels who had been kept in readiness for that hour, day, month, and year, were set at liberty, so that they might kill a third part of mankind.
30858	66	9	16	 The number of the cavalry was two hundred millions; I heard their number.
30859	66	9	17	 And this was the appearance of the horses which I saw in my vision--and of their riders. The body-armour of the riders was red, blue and yellow; and the horses' heads were shaped like the heads of lions, while from their mouths there  came fire and smoke and sulphur.
30860	66	9	18	 By these three plagues a third part of mankind were destroyed--by the fire and the smoke, and by the sulphur which came from their mouths.
30861	66	9	19	 For the power of the horses is in their mouths and  in their tails; their tails being like serpents, and having heads, and it is with them that they inflict injury.
30862	66	9	20	 But the rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues, did not even then repent and leave the things they had made, so as to cease worshipping the demons, and the idols of gold and silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which can neither see nor hear, nor move.
30863	66	9	21	  Nor did they repent of their murders, their practice of magic, their fornication, or their thefts.
30864	66	10	1	  Then I saw another strong angel coming down from Heaven. He was robed in a cloud, and over his head was the rainbow. His face was like the sun, and his feet resembled pillars of fire.
30865	66	10	2	 In his  hand he held a small scroll unrolled; and, planting his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,
30866	66	10	3	 he cried out in a loud voice which resembled the roar of a lion. And when he had cried out, each of the seven peals of thunder uttered its own message.
30867	66	10	4	 And when the seven  peals of thunder had spoken, I was about to write down what they had said; but I heard a voice from Heaven which told me to keep secret all that the seven peals of thunder had said, and not write it down.
30868	66	10	5	 Then the angel that I saw standing on the sea and on the land, lifted his right hand toward Heaven.
30869	66	10	6	 And in the name of Him who lives until the Ages of the Ages, the Creator of Heaven and all that is in it, of the earth and all that is in it, and of the sea and all that is in it, he solemnly declared,
30870	66	10	7	 "There shall be no further  delay; but in the days when the seventh angel blows his trumpet--when he begins to do so--then the secret purposes of God are realized, in accordance with the good news which He gave to His  servants the Prophets."
30871	66	10	8	 Then the voice which I had heard speaking from Heaven once more addressed me. It said, "Go and take the little book which lies open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land."
30872	66	10	9	 So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little book. "Take it," he said, "and  eat the whole of it. You will find it bitter when you have eaten it, although in your mouth it will taste as sweet as honey."
30873	66	10	10	 So I took the roll out of the angel's hand and ate the whole of it; and in my mouth it was as sweet as honey, but when I had eaten it I found it very bitter.
30874	66	10	11	 And  a voice said to me, "You must prophesy yet further concerning peoples, nations, languages, and many kings."
30875	66	11	1	 Then a reed was given me to serve as a measuring rod; and a voice said, "Rise, and measure God's sanctuary--and  the altar--and count the worshipers who are in it.
30876	66	11	2	 But as for the court which is outside the sanctuary, pass it over. Do not measure it; for it has been given to the Gentiles, and for  forty-two months they will trample the holy city under foot.
30877	66	11	3	 And I will authorize My  two witnesses to prophesy for  1,260 days,  clothed in sackcloth.
30878	66	11	4	 "These witnesses are  the two olive-trees, and they are the two lamps which stand in the presence of the Lord of the earth.
30879	66	11	5	 And if any one seeks to injure them--fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies; and if any one seeks to injure them, he will in this way certainly be killed.
30880	66	11	6	 They have power given to them to seal up the sky, so that no rain may fall so long as they continue to prophesy; and power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the  earth with various plagues whenever they choose to do so.
30881	66	11	7	 "And when they have fully delivered their testimony,  the Wild Beast which is to rise out of the bottomless pit will make war upon them and overcome them and kill them.
30882	66	11	8	 And their dead bodies are to lie in the broad street of  the great city which spiritually is designated  `Sodom' and `Egypt,' where indeed their Lord was crucified.
30883	66	11	9	 And men belonging to all peoples, tribes, languages and nations gaze at their dead bodies for three days and a half, but they refuse to let them be laid in a tomb.
30884	66	11	10	 The  inhabitants of the earth rejoice over them and are glad and will send gifts to one another; for these two Prophets had greatly troubled the inhabitants of the earth."
30885	66	11	11	 But at the end of the three days and a half the breath of life from God entered into them, and they rose to their feet; and all who saw them were terrified.
30886	66	11	12	 Then they heard a loud voice calling to them out of Heaven, and bidding them come up; and they  went up to Heaven in the cloud, and their enemies saw them go.
30887	66	11	13	 And just as that time there was a great earthquake, and a tenth part of the city was overthrown. 7,000 people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of Heaven.
30888	66	11	14	 The second Woe is past; the third Woe will soon be here.
30889	66	11	15	 The seventh angel blew his trumpet; and there followed loud voices in Heaven which said, "The sovereignty of the world  now belongs to our Lord and His Christ; and He will be King until the Ages of the Ages."
30890	66	11	16	 Then the twenty-four Elders, who sit on thrones in the presence of God, fell on their faces and worshipped God,
30891	66	11	17	 saying, "We give thee thanks, O Lord God, the Ruler of all, Who art and wast, because Thou hast exerted Thy power, Thy great power, and hast become King.
30892	66	11	18	 The nations grew angry, and Thine anger has come, and the time for the dead to be judged, and the time for Thee to give their reward to Thy servants the Prophets and to Thy people, and to those who fear Thee, the small and the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth."
30893	66	11	19	 Then the doors of God's sanctuary in Heaven were opened, and the Ark, in which His Covenant was, was seen in His sanctuary; and there came flashes of lightning, and voices, and peals of thunder, and an earthquake, and heavy hail.
30894	66	12	1	 And a great marvel was seen in Heaven--  a woman who was robed with the sun and had the moon under her feet, and had also a wreath of stars round her head, was with child,
30895	66	12	2	 and she was crying out in the pains and agony of childbirth.
30896	66	12	3	 And another marvel was seen in Heaven--a  great  fiery-red Dragon, with seven heads and ten horns; and on his heads were seven kingly crowns.
30897	66	12	4	 His tail was drawing after it a third part of the stars of Heaven, and it dashed them to the ground. And in front of the woman who was about to become a mother, the Dragon was standing in order to devour the child as soon as it was born.
30898	66	12	5	 She gave birth to a son--a male child, destined before long to rule all nations with an iron scepter. But her child was  caught up to God and His throne,
30899	66	12	6	 and  the woman  fled into the Desert, there to be cared for, for  1,260 days, in a place which God had prepared for her.
30900	66	12	7	 And war broke out in Heaven, Michael and his angels engaging in battle with the Dragon.
30901	66	12	8	 The Dragon fought and so did his angels; but they were defeated, and there was no longer any room found for them in Heaven.
30902	66	12	9	 The great Dragon, the ancient serpent, he who is called `the Devil' and  `the Adversary' and leads the whole earth astray, was hurled down: he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.
30903	66	12	10	 Then I heard a loud voice speaking in Heaven. It said, "The salvation and the power and the Kingdom of our God  have now come, and the sovereignty of His Christ; for the accuser of our brethren has been hurled down--he who, day after day and night after night, was wont to accuse them in the presence of God.
30904	66	12	11	 But they have gained the victory over him because of the blood of the Lamb and of the testimony which they have borne, and because they held their lives cheap and did not shrink even from death.
30905	66	12	12	 For this reason be glad, O Heaven, and you who live in Heaven! Alas for the earth and the sea! For the Devil has come down to you; full of fierce anger, because he knows that his appointed time is short."
30906	66	12	13	 And when the Dragon saw that he was hurled down to the earth, he went in pursuit of the woman who had given birth to the male child.
30907	66	12	14	 Then,  the two wings of a great eagle were given to the woman to enable her to fly away into the Desert to the place assigned her, there to be cared for, for  a period of time, two periods of time, and half a period of time, beyond the reach of the serpent.
30908	66	12	15	 And the serpent poured water from his mouth--a very river it seemed--after the woman, in the hope that she would be carried away by its flood.
30909	66	12	16	 But the earth came to the woman's help: it opened its mouth and drank up the river which the Dragon had poured from his mouth.
30910	66	12	17	 This made the Dragon furiously angry with the woman, and he went elsewhere to make war upon her other children--those who keep God's commandments and hold fast to the testimony of Jesus.
30911	66	13	1	 And  he took up a position  upon the sands of the sea-shore. Then I saw a  Wild Beast coming up out of the sea, and he had ten horns and seven heads. On his horns were ten kingly crowns, and inscribed on his heads were names full of blasphemy.
30912	66	13	2	 The Wild Beast which I saw  resembled a leopard, and had feet like the feet of a bear, and his mouth was like the mouth of a lion; and it was to the Dragon that he owed his power and his throne and his wide dominion.
30913	66	13	3	 I saw that one of his heads seemed to have been mortally wounded; but  his mortal wound was healed, and the whole world was amazed and followed him.
30914	66	13	4	 And they offered worship to the Dragon, because it was to him that the Wild Beast owed his dominion; and they also offered worship to the Wild Beast, and said,  "Who is there like him? And who is able to engage in battle with him?"
30915	66	13	5	 And there was given him a mouth full of boastful and blasphemous words; and liberty of action was granted him for forty-two months.
30916	66	13	6	 And he opened his mouth to utter blasphemies against God, to speak evil of His name and of His dwelling-place--that is to say, of those who dwell in Heaven.
30917	66	13	7	 And permission was given him to make war upon God's people and conquer them; and power was given him over every tribe, people, language and nation.
30918	66	13	8	 And all the  inhabitants of the  earth will be found to be worshipping him: every one whose name is not recorded in the Book of Life--the Book of the Lamb who has been offered in sacrifice ever since the creation of the world.
30919	66	13	9	 Let all who have ears give heed.
30920	66	13	10	 If any one is eager to lead others into captivity, he must himself go into captivity. If any one is bent on killing with the sword, he must himself be killed by the sword. Here is an opportunity for endurance, and for the exercise of faith, on the part of God's people.
30921	66	13	11	 Then I saw another Wild Beast, coming up out of the earth. He had two horns like those of a lamb, but he  spoke like a dragon.
30922	66	13	12	 And the authority of the first Wild Beast--the whole of that authority--he exercises in his presence, and he causes the  earth and its inhabitants to worship the first Wild Beast, whose mortal wound had been healed.
30923	66	13	13	 He also works great miracles, so as even to make fire come down from Heaven to earth in the presence of human beings.
30924	66	13	14	 And his power of leading astray the  inhabitants of the  earth is due to the marvels which he has been permitted to work in the presence of the Wild Beast. And he told the inhabitants of the earth to erect a statue to the Wild Beast who had received the sword-stroke and yet had recovered.
30925	66	13	15	 And power was granted him to give breath to the statue of the Wild Beast, so that the statue of the Wild Beast could even speak and cause all who refuse to worship it to be put to death.
30926	66	13	16	 And he causes all, small and great, rich and poor, free men and slaves, to have stamped upon them a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads,
30927	66	13	17	 in order that no one should be  allowed to buy or sell unless he had the mark--either the name of the Wild Beast or the number which his name represents.
30928	66	13	18	  Here is scope for ingenuity. Let people of shrewd intelligence calculate the number of the Wild Beast; for it indicates a certain man, and his number is 666.
30929	66	14	1	  Then I looked, and I saw the Lamb standing  upon Mount Zion, and with Him  144,000 people, having His  name and His Father's name written on their foreheads.
30930	66	14	2	 And I heard  music from Heaven which resembled the  sound of many waters and the  roar of loud thunder; and the  music which I heard was like that of harpists playing upon their harps.
30931	66	14	3	 And they were singing what seemed to be a new song, in front of the throne and in the presence of the four living creatures and the Elders; and no one was able to learn that song except the 144,000 people who had been redeemed out of the world.
30932	66	14	4	 These are those who had not defiled themselves with women: they are as pure as virgins. They follow the Lamb  wherever He goes. They have been redeemed from among men, as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.
30933	66	14	5	 And no lie has ever been found upon their lips: they are faultless.
30934	66	14	6	 And I saw another angel flying across the sky, carrying the Good News of the Ages to tell to every nation, tribe, language and people, among  those who live on the  earth.
30935	66	14	7	 He said in a loud voice, "Fear God and give Him glory, because the time of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made sky and earth, the sea and the water-springs."
30936	66	14	8	 And another, a second angel, followed, exclaiming,  "Great Babylon  has fallen, has fallen--she who made all the nations drink the wine of the anger provoked by her fornication."
30937	66	14	9	 And another, a third angel, followed them, exclaiming in a loud voice, "If any one worships the Wild Beast and his statue, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,
30938	66	14	10	 he shall drink the wine of God's anger which stands  ready, undiluted, in the cup of His fury, and he shall be tormented with fire and sulphur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb.
30939	66	14	11	 And the smoke of their  torment goes up until the Ages of the Ages; and the worshipers of the Wild Beast and his statue have no rest day or night, nor has any one who receives the mark of his name.
30940	66	14	12	 Here is  an opportunity for endurance on the part of God's people, who carefully keep His commandments and the faith of Jesus!"
30941	66	14	13	 And I heard a voice speaking from Heaven. It said, "Write as follows: "`Blessed are the dead  who die in the Lord from this time onward. Yes, says the Spirit,  let them rest from their sorrowful labours; for what they have done goes with them.'"
30942	66	14	14	  Then I looked, and a white cloud appeared, and sitting on the cloud was some One resembling the Son of Man, having a wreath of gold upon His head and in His hand a sharp sickle.
30943	66	14	15	 And another, an angel, came out of the sanctuary, calling in a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, and saying,  "Use your sickle and reap the harvest, for the hour for reaping it has come: the harvest of the earth is over-ripe."
30944	66	14	16	 Then He who sat on the cloud  flung His sickle on the earth, and the earth had its harvest reaped.
30945	66	14	17	  And another angel came out from the sanctuary in Heaven, and he too carried a sharp sickle.
30946	66	14	18	 And another angel came out from the altar--he who had power over fire--and he spoke in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, "Use your sharp sickle, and gather the bunches from the vine of the earth, for its grapes are now quite ripe."
30947	66	14	19	 And the angel  flung his sickle down to the earth, and reaped the vine of the earth and threw the grapes into the great winepress of God's anger.
30948	66	14	20	 And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and out of it came blood reaching the horses' bridles for a distance of  200 miles.
30949	66	15	1	 Then I saw another marvel in Heaven, great and wonderful--there were seven angels bringing seven plagues. These are the last plagues, because in them God's anger has found full expression.
30950	66	15	2	 And I saw what seemed to be  a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who had gained the victory over the Wild Beast and over his statue and the number of his name, standing  by the sea of glass and having harps which belonged to God.
30951	66	15	3	 And  they were singing the song of Moses, God's  servant, and the song of the Lamb. Their words were, "Great and wonderful are Thy works, O Lord God, the Ruler of all. Righteous and true are Thy ways, O King of  the nations.
30952	66	15	4	 Who shall not be afraid, O Lord, and glorify Thy name? For Thou  alone art holy. All nations shall come and shall worship Thee, because the righteousness of all that Thou hast done has been made manifest."
30953	66	15	5	 After this, when the doors of the sanctuary of the tent of witness in Heaven were opened, I looked;
30954	66	15	6	 and there came out of the sanctuary the seven angels who were bringing the seven plagues. The angels were clad in pure, bright  linen, and had girdles of gold across their breasts.
30955	66	15	7	 And one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven bowls of gold, full of the anger of God who lives until the Ages of the Ages.
30956	66	15	8	 And the sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power; and no one could enter the sanctuary till the seven plagues brought by the seven angels were at an end.
30957	66	16	1	 Then I heard a loud voice from the sanctuary say to the seven angels, "Go and pour on to the  earth the seven bowls of the anger of God."
30958	66	16	2	 So the first angel went away and poured his bowl on to the earth; and  it brought  a bad and painful sore upon the men who had on them the mark of the Wild Beast and worshipped his statue.
30959	66	16	3	 The second angel poured his bowl into  the sea, and it became blood, like a dead man's blood, and every living creature in the sea died.
30960	66	16	4	 The third angel poured his bowl into  the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood.
30961	66	16	5	 And I heard the angel of the waters say, "Righteous art Thou, who art and wast,  the holy One, because Thou hast thus taken vengeance.
30962	66	16	6	 For they poured out the blood of Thy people and of the Prophets, and in return Thou hast given them blood to drink. And this they deserved."
30963	66	16	7	 And I heard a voice from the altar say, "Even so, O Lord God, the Ruler of all, true and righteous are Thy judgments."
30964	66	16	8	 Then the fourth angel poured his bowl on to  the sun, and power was given to it to scorch men with  fire.
30965	66	16	9	 And the men were severely burned; and yet they spoke evil of God who had power over the plagues, and they did not repent so as to give Him glory.
30966	66	16	10	 The fifth angel poured his bowl on to  the throne of the Wild Beast; and his kingdom became darkened. People gnawed their tongues because of the pain,
30967	66	16	11	 and they spoke evil of the God in Heaven because of their pains and their sores, and did not repent of  their misconduct.
30968	66	16	12	 The sixth angel poured his bowl into that great river, the Euphrates; and its stream was dried up in order  to clear the way for the kings who are to come from the east.
30969	66	16	13	 Then I saw three foul spirits, resembling frogs, issue from the mouth of the Dragon, from the mouth of the Wild Beast, and from the mouth of  the false Prophet.
30970	66	16	14	 For they are the spirits of demons working marvels--spirits that go out to control the kings of the whole earth, to assemble them for the battle which is to take place on  the great day of God, the Ruler of all.
30971	66	16	15	 ("I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the man who keeps awake and guards his raiment for fear he walk about  ill-clad, and his uncomeliness become manifest.")
30972	66	16	16	 And assemble them they did at the place called in Hebrew  `Har-Magedon.'
30973	66	16	17	 Then the seventh angel poured his bowl into  the air; and a loud voice came out of the sanctuary from the throne, saying,  "Everything is now ready."
30974	66	16	18	 Flashes of lightning followed, and voices, and peals of thunder, and an earthquake more dreadful than there had ever been since there was a man upon the earth--so terrible was it, and so great!
30975	66	16	19	 The great city was split into  three parts; the cities of the nations fell; and  great Babylon came into remembrance before God, for Him to make her drink from the wine-cup of His fierce anger.
30976	66	16	20	 Every island fled away, and there was not a mountain anywhere to be seen.
30977	66	16	21	 And heavy hail,  that seemed to be a talent in weight, fell from the sky upon the people; and they spoke evil of God on account of the plague of the hail--because the plague of it was exceedingly severe.
30978	66	17	1	 Then one of the seven angels who were carrying the seven bowls came and spoke to me. "Come with me," he said, "and I will show you the doom of the great  Harlot who  sits upon  many waters.
30979	66	17	2	  The kings of the  earth have committed fornication  with her, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication."
30980	66	17	3	 So he carried me away in the Spirit into a desert, and there I saw a woman  sitting on a  scarlet-colored Wild Beast which was covered with names of blasphemy and had seven heads and ten horns.
30981	66	17	4	 The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and was  brilliantly attired with gold and jewels and pearls. She held in her hand a cup of gold, full of abominations, and she gave filthy indications of her fornication.
30982	66	17	5	 And on her forehead was a name written: "I am a symbol of great Babylon, the mother of the harlots and of the abominations of the earth."
30983	66	17	6	 And I saw the woman drinking herself drunk with  the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And when I saw her I was filled with utter astonishment.
30984	66	17	7	 Then the angel said to me, "Why are you so astonished? I will explain to you the secret meaning of the woman and of the seven-headed, ten-horned Wild Beast which carries her.
30985	66	17	8	 "The Wild Beast which you have seen was, and is not, and yet is destined to  re-ascend, before long, out of the bottomless pit and go his way into perdition. And  the inhabitants of the earth will be filled with amazement--all whose names are not in the Book of Life, having been recorded there ever since the creation of the world--when they see the Wild Beast: because he was, and is not, and yet  is to come.
30986	66	17	9	  Here is scope for the exercise of a mind that has wisdom! The seven heads are the seven hills on which the woman sits.
30987	66	17	10	 And they are  seven kings: five of them have fallen, and the  one is still reigning. The seventh has not yet come, but when he comes he must continue for a short time.
30988	66	17	11	 And the Wild Beast which once existed but does not now exist--he is an eighth king and yet is one of the seven and he goes his way into perdition.
30989	66	17	12	 "And the  ten horns which you have seen are ten kings who have not yet come to the throne, but for a single hour they are to receive authority as kings along with the Wild Beast.
30990	66	17	13	 They have one common policy, and they are to give their power and authority to the Wild Beast.
30991	66	17	14	 They will make war upon the Lamb, and the Lamb will triumph over them; for He is Lord of lords and King of kings. And those who accompany Him--called, as they are, and chosen, and faithful--shall share in the victory."
30992	66	17	15	 He also said to me, "The waters which you have seen, on which the Harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes, nations and languages.
30993	66	17	16	 And the ten horns that you have seen--and the Wild Beast--these will  hate the Harlot, and they will cause her to be laid waste and will strip her bare. They will eat her flesh, and burn her up with fire.
30994	66	17	17	 For God has put it into their hearts to carry out His purpose, and to carry out a common purpose and to give their kingdom to the Wild Beast until God's words have come to pass.
30995	66	17	18	 And the woman whom you have seen is the  great city which has kingly power over the  kings of the  earth."
30996	66	18	1	 After these things I saw another angel coming down from Heaven, armed with great power. The earth shone with his splendor,
30997	66	18	2	 and with a mighty voice he cried out, saying, "Great Babylon has fallen, has fallen, and has become a home for demons and a stronghold for every kind of foul spirit and for every kind of foul and hateful bird.
30998	66	18	3	 For all the nations have drunk the wine of the anger provoked by her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown rich through her excessive luxury."
30999	66	18	4	 Then I heard another voice from Heaven, which said,  "Come out of her, My people, that you may not become partakers in her sins, nor receive a share of her plagues.
31000	66	18	5	 For her sins are piled up to the sky, and God has called to mind her unrighteous deeds.
31001	66	18	6	 Give back to her as  she has given; repay her in accordance with her doings,  twice as much; in the bowl that she has mixed, mix twice as much for her.
31002	66	18	7	 She has freely glorified herself and revelled in luxury; equally freely administer torment to her, and woe. For in her heart she boasts, saying, `I sit enthroned as Queen: no widow am I: I shall never know sorrow.'
31003	66	18	8	 "For this reason calamities shall come thick upon her on a single day--death and sorrow and famine--and she shall be  burned to the ground. For strong is  the Lord God who has judged her.
31004	66	18	9	 The  kings of the earth who have committed fornication with her, and have revelled in luxury, shall weep aloud and lament over her when they see the smoke of her burning,
31005	66	18	10	 while they stand afar off because of their terror at her heavy punishment, and say, `Alas, alas, thou  great city, O Babylon, the mighty city! For in one short hour thy doom has come!'
31006	66	18	11	 And the merchants of the earth weep aloud and lament over her, because now there is no sale for their cargoes--
31007	66	18	12	 cargoes of gold and silver, of jewels and pearls, of fine linen, purple and silk, and of scarlet stuff; all kinds of rare woods, and all kinds of goods in ivory and in very costly wood, in bronze, steel and marble.
31008	66	18	13	 Also cinnamon and amomum; odors to burn as incense or for  perfume; frankincense, wine, oil; fine flour, wheat, cattle and sheep; horses and carriages and slaves; and the lives of men.
31009	66	18	14	 The dainties that thy soul longed for are gone from thee, and all thine elegance and splendor have perished, and never again shall they be found.
31010	66	18	15	 Those who traded in these things, who grew wealthy through her, will stand afar off, struck with terror at her punishment,
31011	66	18	16	 weeping aloud and sorrowing, and saying, `Alas, alas, for this great city, which was brilliantly arrayed in fine linen, and purple and scarlet stuff, and beautified with gold, jewels and pearls;
31012	66	18	17	 because in one short hour all this great wealth has been laid waste!' And every shipmaster and every passenger by sea and the crews and all who ply their trade on the sea,
31013	66	18	18	 stood afar off, and cried aloud when they saw the smoke of her burning. And they said, `What city is like this great city?'
31014	66	18	19	 And they threw dust upon their heads, and cried out, weeping aloud and sorrowing. `Alas, alas,' they said, `for this great city, in which, through her vast wealth, the owners of all the ships on the sea have grown rich; because in one short hour she has been laid waste!'
31015	66	18	20	 Rejoice over her, O Heaven, and you saints and Apostles and Prophets; for God has taken vengeance upon her because of you."
31016	66	18	21	 Then a single angel of great strength took a stone which resembled a huge millstone, and hurled it into the sea, saying, "So shall Babylon, that great city, be violently hurled down and never again be found.
31017	66	18	22	 No harp or song, no flute or trumpet, shall ever again be heard in thee; no craftsman of any kind shall ever again be found in thee; nor shall the grinding of the mill ever again be heard in thee.
31018	66	18	23	 Never again shall the light of a lamp shine in thee, and never again shall the voice of a bridegroom or of a bride be heard in thee. For thy merchants were the great men of the earth, and with the magic which thou didst practise all nations were led astray.
31019	66	18	24	 And in her was found  the blood of Prophets and of God's people and of all who had been put to death on the earth."
31020	66	19	1	 After this I seemed to hear the far-echoing voices of a great multitude in Heaven, who said,  "Hallelujah! The salvation and the glory and the power belong to our God.
31021	66	19	2	 True and just are His judgments, because He has judged the great Harlot who was corrupting the whole  earth with her fornication, and He has taken vengeance for the blood of His bondservants which her hands have shed."
31022	66	19	3	 And a second time they said, "Hallelujah! For her smoke ascends until the Ages of the Ages."
31023	66	19	4	 And the twenty-four Elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God who sits upon the throne. "Even so," they said; "Hallelujah!"
31024	66	19	5	 And from the throne there came a voice which said, "Praise our God, all you His bondservants--you who fear Him, both the small and the great."
31025	66	19	6	 And I seemed to hear the voices of a great multitude and the sound of many waters and of loud peals of thunder, which said, "Hallelujah! Because the Lord our God, the Ruler of all,  has become King.
31026	66	19	7	 Let us rejoice and triumph and give Him the glory; for the time for  the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His Bride has made herself ready."
31027	66	19	8	 And she was permitted to array herself in fine linen, shining and spotless; the fine linen being the  righteous actions of God's people.
31028	66	19	9	 And he said to me, "Write as follows: `Blessed are those who receive an invitation to the  Marriage Supper of the Lamb.'" And he added, still addressing me, "These are truly the words of God."
31029	66	19	10	 Then I fell at his feet to worship him. But he exclaimed, "Oh, do not do that. I am a fellow bondservant of yours and a fellow bondservant of your brethren who have borne testimony to Jesus. Worship God." Testimony to Jesus is the spirit which underlies Prophecy.
31030	66	19	11	 Then I saw a door open in Heaven, and  a white horse appeared. Its rider was named "Faithful and True" --being One who in righteousness acts as Judge, and makes war.
31031	66	19	12	 His eyes were  like a flame of fire, and on His head were many kingly crowns; and He has a name written upon Him which  no one but He Himself knows.
31032	66	19	13	 The outer garment in which He is clad has been dipped in blood and His name is  THE WORD OF GOD.
31033	66	19	14	 The armies in Heaven followed Him--mounted on white horses and clothed in fine linen, white and spotless.
31034	66	19	15	 From His mouth there comes a sharp sword with which He will smite the nations; and He will Himself be their Shepherd, ruling them with a scepter of iron; and it is His work to tread the winepress of the fierce anger of God, the Ruler of all.
31035	66	19	16	 And on His outer garment and on His thigh He has a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.
31036	66	19	17	 And I saw a single angel standing  in the full light of the sun, who cried in a loud voice to all the birds that flew across the sky, "Come and be present at God's great supper,
31037	66	19	18	 that you may feast on the flesh of kings and the flesh of generals and the flesh of mighty men, on the flesh of horses and their riders, and on the flesh of all mankind, whether they are free men or slaves, great men or small."
31038	66	19	19	 And I saw the Wild Beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, all assembled to make war,  once for all, against the Rider upon the horse and against His army. And the Wild Beast was captured, and with him the false Prophet
31039	66	19	20	 who had done the miracles in his presence with which he had led astray those who had received the mark of the Wild Beast, and those who worshipped his statue. Both of them were thrown alive into the Lake of fire that was all ablaze with sulphur.
31040	66	19	21	 But the rest were killed with the sword that came from the mouth of the Rider on the horse. And the birds all fed ravenously upon their flesh.
31041	66	20	1	 Then I saw an angel coming down from Heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit, and upon his arm he carried a great chain.
31042	66	20	2	 He laid hold of the Dragon--the ancient serpent--who is the Devil and  the Adversary, and  bound him for  a thousand years, and hurled him into the bottomless pit.
31043	66	20	3	 He closed the entrance and put a seal upon him in order that he might be unable to lead the nations astray any more until the thousand years were at an end. Afterwards he is to be set at liberty for a short time.
31044	66	20	4	 And I saw  thrones, and some who  were seated on them, to whom judgment was entrusted. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded on account of the testimony that they had borne to Jesus and on account of God's Message, and also the souls of those who had not worshipped the Wild Beast or his statue, nor received his mark on their foreheads or  on their hands; and they  came to Life and were kings with Christ for a thousand years.
31045	66	20	5	  No one else who was dead rose to Life until the thousand years were at an end. This is  the First Resurrection.
31046	66	20	6	 Blessed and holy are those who share in the First Resurrection.  The Second Death has no power over them, but they shall be priests to God and to Christ, and shall be kings with Christ for the thousand years.
31047	66	20	7	 But  when the thousand years are at an end, the Adversary will be released from his imprisonment,
31048	66	20	8	 and will go out to lead astray the nations in all the four corners of the earth,  Gog and Magog, and assemble them for war, and they are like the sands on the seashore in number.
31049	66	20	9	 And they went up over the whole breadth of the earth and surrounded the encampment of God's people and the beloved city. But fire came down from Heaven and consumed them;
31050	66	20	10	 and the Devil,  who had been leading them astray, was thrown into  the Lake of fire and sulphur where the Wild Beast and the false Prophet were, and day and night they will suffer torture until the Ages of the Ages.
31051	66	20	11	 Then I saw  a great white throne and One who was seated on it, from whose presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them.
31052	66	20	12	  And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing in front of the throne. And books were opened; and so was another book--namely, the Book of Life; and the dead were judged by the things recorded in the  books in accordance with what their conduct had been.
31053	66	20	13	 Then the sea yielded up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades yielded up the dead who were in them, and each man was judged in accordance with what his conduct had been.
31054	66	20	14	 Then Death and Hades were thrown into the Lake of fire; this is the Second Death--the Lake of fire.
31055	66	20	15	 And if any one's name was not found recorded in the Book of Life he was thrown into the Lake of fire.
31056	66	21	1	 And I saw  a new Heaven and a new earth; for the first Heaven and the first earth were gone, and  the sea no longer exists.
31057	66	21	2	 And I saw the holy city,  the new Jerusalem, coming down out of Heaven from God and made ready like a bride attired to meet her husband.
31058	66	21	3	 And I heard a loud voice, which came from the throne, say, "God's dwelling place is among men and He will dwell among them and they shall be His peoples. Yes, God Himself will  be among them.
31059	66	21	4	 He will wipe every tear from their eyes. Death shall be no more; nor sorrow, nor wail of woe, nor pain; for the first things have passed away."
31060	66	21	5	 Then He who was seated on the throne said, "I am re-creating all things." And He added, "Write down these words, for they are trustworthy and true."
31061	66	21	6	 He also said, "They have now been fulfilled. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To those who are thirsty I will give the privilege of drinking from the well of the Water of Life without payment.
31062	66	21	7	 All this shall be the heritage of him who overcomes, and I will be his God and he shall be one of My sons.
31063	66	21	8	 But as for cowards and the unfaithful, and the polluted, and murderers, fornicators, and those who practise magic or worship idols, and all liars--the portion allotted to them shall be in the Lake which burns with fire and sulphur. This is  the Second Death."
31064	66	21	9	 Then there came one of the seven angels who were carrying the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues. "Come with me," he said, "and I will show you  the Bride, the Lamb's wife."
31065	66	21	10	 So in the Spirit he carried me to the top of a vast, lofty mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of Heaven from God,
31066	66	21	11	 and  bringing with it  the glory of God. It shone with a radiance like that of a very precious stone--such as a jasper, bright and transparent.
31067	66	21	12	 It has a wall, massive and high, with twelve large gates, and  in charge of the gates were twelve angels. And overhead, above the gates, names were inscribed which are those of the twelve tribes of the descendants of Israel.
31068	66	21	13	  There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south, and three on the west.
31069	66	21	14	 The wall of the city had  twelve foundation stones, and engraved upon them were twelve names--the names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.
31070	66	21	15	 Now he who was speaking to me had a measuring-rod of gold, with which to measure the city and its gates and its wall.
31071	66	21	16	 The plan of the city is  a square, the length being the same as the breadth; and he measured the city  furlong by furlong, with his measuring rod--it is twelve hundred  miles long, and the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
31072	66	21	17	 And he  measured the wall of it--a wall of a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to human measure, which was also that of the angel.
31073	66	21	18	 The  solid fabric of the wall was jasper; and the city itself was made of gold,  resembling transparent glass.
31074	66	21	19	 As for the foundation-stones of the city wall, which were beautified with various kinds of precious stones, the first was jasper, the second  sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius,
31075	66	21	20	 the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.
31076	66	21	21	 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each of them consisting of a single pearl. And the main street of the city was made of  pure gold, resembling transparent glass.
31077	66	21	22	 I saw no sanctuary in the city, for the Lord God, the Ruler of all, is its Sanctuary, and so is the Lamb.
31078	66	21	23	 Nor has the city any need of the sun or of the moon, to give it light; for the glory of God has shone upon it and  its lamp is the Lamb.
31079	66	21	24	 The nations will live their lives by its light; and the kings of the earth are to bring their glory into it.
31080	66	21	25	 And in the daytime (for there will be no night there) the gates will never be closed;
31081	66	21	26	 and the glory and honor of the nations shall be brought into it.
31082	66	21	27	 And no unclean thing shall ever enter it, nor any one who is guilty of base conduct or tells lies, but only they whose names stand recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life.
31083	66	22	1	 Then he showed me the river of the Water of Life, bright as crystal, issuing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.
31084	66	22	2	 On either side of the river,  midway between it and the main street of the city, was  the Tree of Life. It produced twelve kinds of fruit, yielding a fresh crop month by month, and the leaves of the tree served as medicine for the nations.
31085	66	22	3	 "In future there will be no  curse," he said, "but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be  in that city. And His  servants will render Him holy service and will see His face,
31086	66	22	4	 and His  name will be on their foreheads.
31087	66	22	5	 And there will be no night there; and they have no need of lamplight or sunlight, for the Lord God will shine upon them, and they will be kings until the Ages of the Ages."
31088	66	22	6	 And he said to me, "These words are trustworthy and true; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the Prophets, sent His angel to make known to His  servants the things which must soon happen.
31089	66	22	7	 `I am coming quickly.' Blessed is he who is mindful of the predictions contained in this book."
31090	66	22	8	 I John heard and saw these things; and when I had heard and seen them, I fell at the feet of the angel who was showing me them--to worship him.
31091	66	22	9	 But he said to me, "Oh, do not do that. I am a fellow bondservant of yours, and a fellow bondservant of your brethren the Prophets and of those who are mindful of the teachings of this book. Worship God."
31092	66	22	10	  "Make no secret," he added, "of the meaning of the predictions contained in this book; for the time for their fulfillment is now close at hand.
31093	66	22	11	 Let the dishonest man act dishonestly  still; let the filthy make himself filthy  still; let the righteous practise righteousness  still; and let the holy be made holy  still."
31094	66	22	12	 "I am coming quickly; and My reward is with Me, that I may requite every man in accordance with what his conduct has been.
31095	66	22	13	 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.
31096	66	22	14	 Blessed are those who  wash their robes clean, that they may have a right to the Tree of Life, and may go through the gates into the city.
31097	66	22	15	 The  unclean are shut out, and so are  all who practise magic, all fornicators, all murderers, and those who worship idols, and every one who loves falsehood and tells lies.
31098	66	22	16	 "I Jesus have sent My angel for him solemnly to declare these things to you among the Churches. I am the Root and the offspring of David, the bright  Morning Star.
31099	66	22	17	 The Spirit and the Bride say, `Come;' and whoever hears, let him say, `Come;' and let those who are thirsty come. Whoever will, let him take the Water of Life, without payment.
31100	66	22	18	 "I solemnly declare to every one who hears the words of the prophecy contained in this book, that if any one adds to those words, God will add to him the plagues spoken of in this book;
31101	66	22	19	 and that if any one  takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take from him his share in the Tree of Life and in the holy city--the things described in this book.
31102	66	22	20	 "He who solemnly declares all this says, "`Yes, I am coming quickly.'"  Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.
31103	66	22	21	 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God's people.
