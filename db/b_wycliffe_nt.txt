23169	40	1	24	And Joseph roos fro sleepe, and dide as the aungel of the Lord comaundide hym, and took Marie, his wijf;
23170	40	1	25	and he knew her not, til she hadde borun her firste bigete sone, and clepide his name Jhesus.
23171	40	2	1	Therfor whanne Jhesus was borun in Bethleem of Juda, in the daies of king Eroude, lo! astromyenes camen fro the eest to Jerusalem,
23172	40	2	2	and seiden, Where is he, that is borun king of Jewis? for we han seyn his sterre in the eest, and we comen to worschipe him.
23173	40	2	3	But king Eroude herde, and was trublid, and al Jerusalem with hym.
23174	40	2	4	And he gaderide to gidre alle the prynces of prestis, and scribis of the puple, and enqueride of hem, where Crist shulde be borun.
23175	40	2	5	And thei seiden to hym, In Bethleem of Juda; for so it is writun bi a profete,
23176	40	2	6	And thou, Bethleem, the lond of Juda, art not the leest among the prynces of Juda; for of thee a duyk schal go out, that schal gouerne my puple of Israel.
23177	40	2	7	Thanne Eroude clepide pryueli the astromyens, and lernyde bisili of hem the tyme of the sterre that apperide to hem.
23178	40	2	8	And he sente hem in to Bethleem, and seide, Go ye, and axe ye bisili of the child, and whanne yee han foundun, telle ye it to me, that Y also come, and worschipe hym.
23179	40	2	9	And whanne thei hadden herd the kyng, thei wenten forth. And lo! the sterre, that thei siyen in the eest, wente bifore hem, til it cam, and stood aboue, where the child was.
23180	40	2	10	And thei siyen the sterre, and ioyeden with a ful greet ioye.
23181	40	2	11	And thei entriden in to the hous, and founden the child with Marie, his modir; and thei felden doun, and worschipiden him. And whanne thei hadden openyd her tresouris, thei offryden to hym yiftis, gold, encense, and myrre.
23182	40	2	12	And whanne thei hadden take an aunswere in sleep, that thei schulden not turne ayen to Eroude, thei turneden ayen bi anothir weie in to her cuntrey.
23183	40	2	13	And whanne thei weren goon, lo! the aungel of the Lord apperide to Joseph in sleep, and seide, Rise vp, and take the child and his modir, and fle in to Egipt, and be thou there, til that I seie to thee; for it is to come, that Eroude seke the child, to destrie hym.
23184	40	2	14	And Joseph roos, and took the child and his modir bi nyyt, and wente in to Egipt,
23185	40	2	15	and he was there to the deeth of Eroude; that it schulde be fulfillid, that was seid of the Lord bi the profete, seiynge, Fro Egipt Y haue clepid my sone.
23186	40	2	16	Thanne Eroude seynge that he was disseyued of the astromyens, was ful wrooth; and he sente, and slowe alle the children, that weren in Bethleem, and in alle the coostis therof, fro two yeer age and with inne, aftir the tyme that he had enquerid of the astromyens.
23187	40	2	17	Thanne `it was fulfillid, that was seid bi Jeremye, the profete,
23188	40	2	18	seiynge, A vois was herd an hiy, wepynge and moche weilyng, Rachel biwepynge hir sones, and she wolde not be coumfortid, for thei ben noyt.
23189	40	2	19	But whanne Eroude was deed, loo! the aungel of the Lord apperide to Joseph in sleep in Egipt,
23190	40	2	20	and seide, Ryse vp, and take the child and his modir, and go in to the lond of Israel; for thei that souyten the lijf of the chijld ben deed.
23191	40	2	21	Joseph roos, and took the child and his modir, and cam in to the loond of Israel.
23192	40	2	22	And he herde that Archilaus regnede in Judee for Eroude, his fadir, and dredde to go thidir. And he was warned in sleep, and wente in to the parties of Galilee;
23193	40	2	23	and cam, and dwelte in a citee, that ys clepid Nazareth, that it shulde be fulfillid, that was seid bi profetis, For he shal be clepid a Nazarey.
23194	40	3	1	In tho daies Joon Baptist cam, and prechide in the desert of Judee,
23195	40	3	2	and seide, Do ye penaunce, for the kyngdom of heuenes shal neiye.
23196	40	3	3	For this is he, of whom it is seid bi Ysaie, the prophete, seyinge, A vois of a crier in desert, Make ye redi the weies of the Lord; make ye riyt the pathis of hym.
23197	40	3	4	And this Joon hadde clothing of camels heeris, and a girdil of skynne aboute hise leendis; and his mete was honysoukis, and hony of the wode.
23198	40	3	5	Thanne Jerusalem wente out to hym, and al Judee, and al the cuntre aboute Jordan;
23199	40	3	6	and thei weren waischun of hym in Jordan, `and knowlechiden her synnes.
23200	40	3	7	But he siy manye of the Farysees and of Saduceis comynge to his baptym, and seide to hem, Generaciouns of eddris, who shewide to you to fle fro the wraththe that is to come?
23201	40	3	8	Therfor do ye worthi fruyte of penaunce,
23202	40	3	9	and nyle ye seie with ynne you, We han Abraham to fadir; for Y seie to you, that God is myyti to reise vp of these stoones the sones of Abraham.
23203	40	3	10	And now the ax is put to the roote of the tree; therfore euery tree that makith not good fruyt, shal be kit doun, and shal be cast in to the fier.
23204	40	3	11	Y waische you in water, in to penaunce; but he that shal come after me is strongere than Y, whos schoon Y am not worthi to bere; he shal baptise you in the Hooli Goost and fier.
23205	40	3	12	Whos wynewing cloth is in his hoond, and he shal fulli clense his corn flore, and shal gadere his whete in to his berne; but the chaffe he shal brenne with fier that mai not be quenchid.
23206	40	3	13	Thanne Jhesus cam fro Galilee in to Jordan to Joon, to be baptised of hym.
23207	40	3	14	And Joon forbede him, and seide, Y owe to be baptisid of thee, and thou comest to me?
23208	40	3	15	But Jhesus answeride, and seide to hym, Suffre nowe, for thus it fallith to vs to fulfille al riytfulnesse.
23209	40	3	16	Thanne Joon suffride hym. And whanne Jhesus was baptisid, anoon he wente up fro the watir; and lo! heuenes weren openyd to hym, and he saie the Spirit of God comynge doun as a dowue, and comynge on hym; and loo!
23210	40	3	17	a vois fro heuenes, seiynge, This is my louyd sone, in which Y haue plesid to me.
23211	40	4	1	Thanne Jhesus was led of a spirit in to desert, to be temptid of the feend.
23212	40	4	2	And whanne he hadde fastid fourti daies and fourti nyytis, aftirward he hungride.
23213	40	4	3	And the tempter cam nyy, and seide to hym, If thou art Goddis sone, seie that thes stoones be maad looues.
23214	40	4	4	Which answeride, and seide to hym, It is writun, Not oonli in breed luyeth man, but in ech word that cometh of Goddis mouth.
23215	40	4	5	Thanne the feend took hym in to the hooli citee, and settide hym on the pynacle of the temple,
23216	40	4	6	and seide to hym, If thou art Goddis sone, sende thee adoun; for it is writun, That to hise aungels he comaundide of thee, and thei schulen take thee in hondis, lest perauenture thou hirte thi foot at a stoon.
23217	40	4	7	Eftsoone Jhesus seide to hym, It is writun, Thou shalt not tempte thi Lord God.
23218	40	4	8	Eftsoone the feend took hym in to a ful hiy hil, and schewide to hym alle the rewmes of the world, and the ioye of hem;
23219	40	4	9	and seide to hym, Alle these `Y schal yyue to thee, if thou falle doun and worschipe me.
23220	40	4	10	Thanne Jhesus seide to hym, Goo, Sathanas; for it is writun, Thou schalt worschipe thi Lord God, and to hym aloone thou shalt serue.
23221	40	4	11	Thanne the feend lafte hym; and lo! aungels camen nyy, and serueden to hym.
23222	40	4	12	But whanne Jhesus hadde herd that Joon was takun, he wente in to Galilee.
23223	40	4	13	And he lefte the citee of Nazareth, and cam, and dwelte in the citee of Cafarnaum, biside the see, in the coostis of Zabulon and Neptalym,
23224	40	4	14	that it shulde be fulfillid, that was seid by Ysaie, the profete, seiynge,
23225	40	4	15	The lond of Sabulon and the lond of Neptalym, the weie of the see ouer Jordan, of Galilee of hethen men,
23226	40	4	16	the puple that walkide in derknessis saye greet liyt, and while men satten in the cuntre of shadewe of deth, liyt aroos to hem.
23227	40	4	17	Fro that tyme Jhesus bigan to preche, and seie, Do ye penaunce, for the kyngdom of heuenes schal come niy.
23228	40	4	18	And Jhesus walkide bisidis the see of Galilee, and saye twei britheren, Symount, that is clepid Petre, and Andrewe, his brothir, castynge nettis in to the see; for thei weren fischeris.
23229	40	4	19	And he seide to hem, Come ye aftir me, and Y shal make you to be maad fisscheris of men.
23230	40	4	20	And anoon thei leften the nettis, and sueden hym.
23231	40	4	21	And he yede forth fro that place, and saie tweyne othere britheren, James of Zebede, and Joon, his brother, in a schip with Zebede, her fadir, amendynge her nettis, and he clepide hem.
23232	40	4	22	And anoon thei leften the nettis and the fadir, and sueden hym.
23233	40	4	23	And Jhesus yede aboute al Galilee, techynge in the synagogis of hem, and prechynge the gospel of the kyngdom, and heelynge euery languor and eche sekenesse among the puple.
23234	40	4	24	And his fame wente in to al Sirie; and thei brouyten to hym alle that weren at male ese, and that weren take with dyuerse languores and turmentis, and hem that hadden feendis, and lunatike men, and men in palesy, and he heelide hem.
23235	40	4	25	And ther sueden hym myche puple of Galile, and of Decapoli, and of Jerusalem, and of Judee, and of biyende Jordan.
23236	40	5	1	And Jhesus, seynge the puple, wente vp in to an hil; and whanne he was set, hise disciplis camen to hym.
23237	40	5	2	And he openyde his mouth, and tauyte hem, and seide,
23238	40	5	3	Blessed ben pore men in spirit, for the kyngdom of heuenes is herne.
23239	40	5	4	Blessid ben mylde men, for thei schulen welde the erthe.
23240	40	5	5	Blessid ben thei that mornen, for thei schulen be coumfortid.
23241	40	5	6	Blessid ben thei that hungren and thristen riytwisnesse, for thei schulen be fulfillid.
23242	40	5	7	Blessid ben merciful men, for thei schulen gete merci.
23243	40	5	8	Blessid ben thei that ben of clene herte, for thei schulen se God.
23244	40	5	9	Blessid ben pesible men, for thei schulen be clepid Goddis children.
23245	40	5	10	Blessid ben thei that suffren persecusioun for riytfulnesse, for the kingdam of heuenes is herne.
23246	40	5	11	`Ye schulen be blessid, whanne men schulen curse you, and schulen pursue you, and shulen seie al yuel ayens you liynge, for me.
23247	40	5	12	Ioie ye, and be ye glad, for youre meede is plenteuouse in heuenes; for so thei han pursued `also profetis that weren bifor you.
23248	40	5	13	Ye ben salt of the erthe; that if the salt vanysche awey, whereynne schal it be saltid? To no thing it is worth ouere, no but that it be cast out, and be defoulid of men.
23249	40	5	14	Ye ben liyt of the world; a citee set on an hil may not be hid;
23250	40	5	15	ne me teendith not a lanterne, and puttith it vndur a busschel, but on a candilstike, that it yyue liyt to alle that ben in the hous.
23251	40	5	16	So schyne youre liyt befor men, that thei se youre goode werkis, and glorifie youre fadir that is in heuenes.
23252	40	5	17	Nil ye deme, that Y cam to vndo the lawe, or the profetis; Y cam not to vndo the lawe, but to fulfille.
23253	40	5	18	Forsothe Y seie to you, til heuene and erthe passe, o lettir or o titel shal not passe fro the lawe, til alle thingis be doon.
23254	40	5	19	Therfor he that brekith oon of these leeste maundementis, and techith thus men, schal be clepid the leste in the rewme of heuenes; `but he that doith, and techith, schal be clepid greet in the kyngdom of heuenes.
23255	40	5	20	And Y seie to you, that but your riytfulnesse be more plenteuouse than of scribis and of Farisees, ye schulen not entre into the kyngdom of heuenes.
23256	40	5	21	Ye han herd that it was seid to elde men, Thou schalt not slee; and he that sleeth, schal be gilti to doom.
23257	40	5	22	But Y seie to you, that ech man that is wrooth to his brothir, schal be gilti to doom; and he that seith to his brother, Fy! schal be gilti to the counseil; but he that seith, Fool, schal be gilti to the fier of helle.
23258	40	5	23	Therfor if thou offrist thi yifte `at the auter, and ther thou bithenkist, that thi brothir hath sum what ayens thee,
23259	40	5	24	leeue there thi yifte bifor the auter, and go first to be recounselid to thi brothir, and thanne thou schalt come, and schalt offre thi yifte.
23260	40	5	25	Be thou consentynge to thin aduersarie soone, while thou art in the weie with hym, lest perauenture thin aduersarie take thee to the domesman, and the domesman take thee to the mynystre, and thou be sent in to prisoun.
23261	40	5	26	Treuli Y seie to thee, thou shalt not go out fro thennus, til thou yelde the last ferthing.
23262	40	5	27	Ye han herd that it was seid to elde men, Thou schalt `do no letcherie.
23263	40	5	28	But Y seie to you, that euery man that seeth a womman for to coueite hir, hath now do letcherie bi hir in his herte.
23264	40	5	29	That if thi riyt iye sclaundre thee, pulle hym out, and caste fro thee; for it spedith to thee, that oon of thi membris perische, than that al thi bodi go in to helle.
23265	40	5	30	And if thi riyt hond sclaundre thee, kitte hym aweye, and caste fro thee; for it spedith to thee that oon of thi membris perische, than that al thi bodi go in to helle.
23266	40	5	31	And it hath be seyd, Who euere leeueth his wijf, yyue he to hir a libel of forsakyng.
23267	40	5	32	But Y seie to you, that euery man that leeueth his wijf, outtakun cause of fornycacioun, makith hir to do letcherie, and he that weddith the forsakun wijf, doith auowtrye.
23268	40	5	33	Eftsoone ye han herd, that it was seid to elde men, Thou schalt not forswere, but thou schalt yelde thin othis to the Lord.
23269	40	5	34	But Y seie to you, that ye swere not `for ony thing; nethir bi heuene, for it is the trone of God;
23270	40	5	35	nether bi the erthe, for it is the stole of his feet; nether bi Jerusalem, for it is the citee of a greet kyng; nether thou shalt not swere bi thin heed,
23271	40	5	36	for thou maist not make oon heere white, ne blacke;
23272	40	5	37	but be youre word, Yhe, yhe; Nay, nay; and that that is more than these, is of yuel.
23273	40	5	38	Ye han herd that it hath be seid, Iye for iye, and tothe for tothe.
23274	40	5	39	But Y seie to you, that ye ayenstonde not an yuel man; but if ony smyte thee in the riyt cheke, schewe to him also the tothir;
23275	40	5	40	and to hym that wole stryue with thee in doom, and take awey thi coote, leeue thou `to him also thi mantil;
23276	40	5	41	and who euer constreyneth thee a thousynde pacis, go thou with hym othir tweyne.
23277	40	5	42	Yyue thou to hym that axith of thee, and turne not awey fro hym that wole borewe of thee.
23278	40	5	43	Ye han herd that it was seid, Thou shalt loue thi neiybore, and hate thin enemye.
23279	40	5	44	But Y seie to you, loue ye youre enemyes, do ye wel to hem that hatiden you, and preye ye for hem that pursuen, and sclaundren you;
23280	40	5	45	that ye be the sones of your fadir that is in heuenes, that makith his sunne to rise vpon goode `and yuele men, and reyneth on iust men and vniuste.
23281	40	5	46	For if ye louen hem that louen you, what mede schulen ye han? whether pupplicans doon not this?
23282	40	5	47	And if ye greten youre britheren oonli, what schulen ye do more? ne doon not hethene men this?
23283	40	5	48	Therfore be ye parfit, as youre heuenli fadir is parfit.
23284	40	6	1	Takith hede, that ye do not youre riytwisnesse bifor men, to be seyn of hem, ellis ye schulen haue no meede at youre fadir that is in heuenes.
23285	40	6	2	Therfore whanne thou doist almes, nyle thou trumpe tofore thee, as ypocritis doon in synagogis and stretis, that thei be worschipid of men; sotheli Y seie to you, they han resseyued her meede.
23286	40	6	3	But whanne thou doist almes, knowe not thi left hond what thi riyt hond doith, that thin almes be in hidils,
23287	40	6	4	and thi fadir that seeth in hiddils, schal quyte thee.
23288	40	6	5	And whanne ye preyen, ye schulen not be as ipocritis, that louen to preye stondynge in synagogis and corneris of stretis, to be seyn of men; treuli Y seie to you, thei han resseyued her meede.
23289	40	6	6	But whanne thou schalt preye, entre in to thi couche, and whanne the dore is schet, preye thi fadir in hidils, and thi fadir that seeth in hidils, schal yelde to thee.
23290	40	6	7	But in preiyng nyle yee speke myche, as hethene men doon, for thei gessen that thei ben herd in her myche speche.
23291	40	6	8	Therfor nyle ye be maad lich to hem, for your fadir woot what is nede to you, bifore that ye axen hym.
23292	40	6	9	And thus ye schulen preye, Oure fadir that art in heuenes, halewid be thi name;
23293	40	6	10	thi kyngdoom come to; be thi wille don `in erthe as in heuene;
23294	40	6	11	yyue to vs this dai oure `breed ouer othir substaunce;
23295	40	6	12	and foryyue to vs oure dettis, as we foryyuen to oure dettouris; and lede vs not in to temptacioun,
23296	40	6	13	but delyuere vs fro yuel.
23297	40	6	14	Amen. For if ye foryyuen to men her synnes, youre heuenli fadir schal foryyue to you youre trespassis.
23298	40	6	15	Sotheli if ye foryyuen not to men, nether youre fadir schal foryyue to you youre synnes.
23299	40	6	16	But whanne ye fasten, nyle ye be maad as ypocritis sorewful, for thei defacen hem silf, to seme fastyng to men; treuli Y seie to you, they han resseyued her meede.
23300	40	6	17	But whanne thou fastist, anoynte thin heed, and waische thi face,
23301	40	6	18	that thou be not seen fastynge to men, but to thi fadir that is in hidlis, and thi fadir that seeth in priuey, shal yelde to thee.
23302	40	6	19	Nile ye tresoure to you tresouris in erthe, where ruste and mouyte destrieth, and where theues deluen out and stelen;
23303	40	6	20	but gadere to you tresouris in heuene, where nether ruste ne mouyte distrieth, and where theues deluen not out, ne stelen.
23304	40	6	21	For where thi tresoure is, there also thin herte is.
23305	40	6	22	The lanterne of thi bodi is thin iye; if thin iye be symple, al thi bodi shal be liytful;
23306	40	6	23	but if thin iye be weiward, al thi bodi shal be derk. If thanne the liyt that is in thee be derknessis, how grete schulen thilk derknessis be?
23307	40	6	24	No man may serue tweyn lordis, for ethir he schal hate `the toon, and loue the tother; ethir he shal susteyne `the toon, and dispise the tothir. Ye moun not serue God and richessis.
23308	40	6	25	Therfor I seie to you, that ye be not bisi to youre lijf, what ye schulen ete; nether to youre bodi, with what ye schulen be clothid. Whether lijf is not more than meete, and the bodie more than cloth?
23309	40	6	26	Biholde ye the foulis of the eire, for thei sowen not, nethir repen, nethir gaderen in to bernes; and youre fadir of heuene fedith hem. Whether ye ben not more worthi than thei?
23310	40	6	27	But who of you thenkynge mai putte to his stature o cubit?
23311	40	6	28	And of clothing what ben ye bisye? Biholde ye the lilies of the feeld, how thei wexen. Thei trauelen not, nether spynnen;
23312	40	6	29	and Y seie to you, Salomon in al his glorie was not keuered as oon of these.
23313	40	6	30	And if God clothith thus the hei of the feeld, that to day is, and to morewe is cast in to an ouen, hou myche more you of litel feith?
23314	40	6	31	Therfor nyle ye be bisi, seiynge, What schulen we ete? or, What schulen we drinke? or, With what thing schulen we be keuered?
23315	40	6	32	For hethene men seken alle these thingis; and youre fadir woot, that ye han nede to alle these thingis.
23316	40	6	33	Therfor seke ye first the kyngdom of God, and his riytfulnesse, and alle these thingis shulen be cast to you.
23317	40	6	34	Therfor nyle ye be bisy in to the morew, for the morew shal be bisi to `hym silf; for it suffisith to the dai his owen malice.
23318	40	7	1	Nile ye deme, `that ye be not demed; for in what doom ye demen,
23319	40	7	2	ye schulen be demed, and in what mesure ye meten, it schal be meten ayen to you.
23320	40	7	3	But what seest thou a litil mote in the iye of thi brother, and seest not a beem in thin owne iye?
23321	40	7	4	Or hou seist thou to thi brothir, Brothir, suffre I schal do out a mote fro thin iye, and lo! a beem is in thin owne iye?
23322	40	7	5	Ipocrite, `do thou out first the beem of thin iye, and thanne thou schalt se to do out the mote of the iye of thi brothir.
23323	40	7	6	Nile ye yyue hooli thing to houndis, nethir caste ye youre margaritis bifore swyne, lest perauenture thei defoulen hem with her feet, and the houndis be turned, and al to-tere you.
23324	40	7	7	Axe ye, and it schal be youun to you; seke ye, and ye schulen fynde; knocke ye, and it schal be openyd to you.
23325	40	7	8	For ech that axith, takith; and he that sekith, fyndith; and it schal be openyd to hym, that knockith.
23326	40	7	9	What man of you is, that if his sone axe hym breed, whethir he wole take hym a stoon?
23327	40	7	10	Or if he axe fische, whether he wole take hym an edder?
23328	40	7	11	Therfor if ye, whanne ye ben yuele men, kunnen yyue good yiftis to youre sones, hou myche more youre fadir that is in heuenes schal yyue good thingis to men that axen hym?
23329	40	7	12	Therfor alle thingis, what euere thingis ye wolen that men do to you, do ye to hem, for this is the lawe and the prophetis.
23330	40	7	13	Entre ye bi the streyt yate; for the yate that ledith to perdicioun is large, and the weie is broode, and there ben many that entren bi it.
23331	40	7	14	Hou streit is the yate, and narwy the weye, that ledith to lijf, and ther ben fewe that fynden it.
23332	40	7	15	Be ye war of fals prophetis, that comen to you in clothingis of scheep, but withynneforth thei ben as wolues of raueyn;
23333	40	7	16	of her fruytis ye schulen knowe hem. Whether men gaderen grapis of thornes, or figus of breris?
23334	40	7	17	So euery good tre makith good fruytis; but an yuel tre makith yuel fruytis.
23335	40	7	18	A good tre may not make yuel fruytis, nethir an yuel tre make good fruytis.
23336	40	7	19	Euery tre that makith not good fruyt, schal be kyt doun, and schal be cast in to the fier.
23337	40	7	20	Therfor of her fruytis ye schulen knowe hem.
23338	40	7	21	Not ech man that seith to me, Lord, Lord, schal entre in to the kyngdom of heuenes; but he that doith the wille of my fadir that is in heuenes, he schal entre in to the kyngdoom of heuenes.
23339	40	7	22	Many schulen seie to me in that dai, Lord, Lord, whether we han not prophesied in thi name, and han caste out feendis in thi name, and han doon many vertues in thi name?
23340	40	7	23	And thanne Y schal knouleche to hem, That Y knewe you neuere; departe awei fro me, ye that worchen wickidnesse.
23341	40	7	24	Therfor ech man that herith these my wordis, and doith hem, schal be maad lijk to a wise man, that hath bildid his hous on a stoon.
23342	40	7	25	And reyn felde doun, and flodis camen, and wyndis blewen, and russchiden `in to that hous; and it felde not doun, for it was foundun on a stoon.
23343	40	7	26	And euery man that herith these my wordis, and doith hem not, is lijk to a fool, that hath bildid his hous on grauel.
23344	40	7	27	And reyn cam doun, and floodis camen, and wyndis blewen, and thei hurliden ayen that hous; and it felde doun, and the fallyng doun therof was greet.
23345	40	7	28	And it was doon, whanne Jhesus hadde endid these wordis, the puple wondride on his techyng;
23346	40	7	29	for he tauyte hem, as he that hadde power, and not as the scribis `of hem, and the Farisees.
23347	40	8	1	But whanne Jhesus was come doun fro the hil, mych puple suede hym.
23348	40	8	2	And loo! a leprouse man cam, and worschipide hym, and seide, Lord, if thou wolt, thou maist make me clene.
23349	40	8	3	And Jhesus helde forth the hoond, and touchide hym, and seide, Y wole, be thou maad cleene. And anoon the lepre of him was clensid.
23350	40	8	4	And Jhesus seide to hym, Se, seie thou to no man; but go, shewe thee to the prestis, and offre the yift that Moyses comaundide, in witnessyng to hem.
23351	40	8	5	And whanne he hadde entrid in to Cafarnaum, `the centurien neiyede to him, and preiede him,
23352	40	8	6	and seide, Lord, my childe lijth in the hous sijk on the palesie, and is yuel turmentid.
23353	40	8	7	And Jhesus seide to him, Y schal come, and schal heele him.
23354	40	8	8	And the centurien answeride, and seide to hym, Lord, Y am not worthi, that thou entre vndur my roof; but oonli seie thou bi word, and my childe shal be heelid.
23355	40	8	9	For whi Y am a man ordeyned vndur power, and haue knyytis vndir me; and Y seie to this, Go, and he goith; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my seruaunt, Do this, and he doith it.
23356	40	8	10	And Jhesus herde these thingis, and wondride, and seide to men `that sueden him, Treuli Y seie to you, Y foond not so greet feith in Israel.
23357	40	8	11	And Y seie to you, that many schulen come fro the eest and the west, and schulen reste with Abraham and Ysaac and Jacob in the kyngdom of heuenes;
23358	40	8	12	but the sones of the rewme schulen be cast out in to vtmer derknessis; there schal be wepyng, and grynting of teeth.
23359	40	8	13	And Jhesus seide to the centurioun, Go, and as thou hast bileuyd, be it doon to thee. And the child was heelid fro that hour.
23360	40	8	14	And whanne Jhesus was comun in to the hous of Symount Petre, he say his wyues modir liggynge, and shakun with feueris.
23361	40	8	15	And he touchide hir hoond, and the feuer lefte hir; and she roos, and seruede hem.
23362	40	8	16	And whanne it was euen, thei brouyten to hym manye that hadden deuelis, and he castide out spiritis bi word, and heelide alle that weren yuel at ese;
23363	40	8	17	that it were fulfillid, that was seid by Ysaie, the profete, seiynge, He took oure infirmytees, and bar oure siknessis.
23364	40	8	18	And Jhesus say myche puple aboute him, and bade hise disciplis go ouer the watir.
23365	40	8	19	And a scribe neiyede, and seide to hym, Maistir, Y shal sue thee, whidir euer thou schalt go.
23366	40	8	20	And Jhesus seide to hym, Foxis han dennes, and briddis of heuene han nestis, but mannus sone hath not where `he schal reste his heed.
23367	40	8	21	Anothir of his disciplis seide to him, Lord, suffre me to go first, and birie my fader.
23368	40	8	22	But Jhesus seide to hym, Sue thou me, and lete deed men birie her deede men.
23369	40	8	23	And whanne he was goon vp in to a litil schip, his disciplis sueden hym.
23370	40	8	24	And loo! a greet stiring was maad in the see, so that the schip was hilid with wawes; but he slepte.
23371	40	8	25	And hise disciplis camen to hym, and reysiden hym, and seiden, Lord, saue vs; we perischen.
23372	40	8	26	And Jhesus seide to hem, What ben ye of litil feith agaste? Thanne he roos, and comaundide to the wyndis and the see, and a greet pesibilnesse was maad.
23373	40	8	27	And men wondriden, and seiden, What maner man is he this, for the wyndis and the see obeischen to him?
23374	40	8	28	And whanne Jhesus was comun ouer the watir in to the cuntre of men of Gerasa, twey men metten hym, that hadden deuelis, and camen out of graues, ful woode, so that noo man myyte go bi that weie.
23375	40	8	29	And lo! thei crieden, and seiden, What to vs and to thee, Jhesu, the sone of God? `art thou comun hidir bifore the tyme to turmente vs?
23376	40	8	30	And not fer fro hem was a flocke of many swyne lesewynge.
23377	40	8	31	And the deuelis preyeden hym, and seiden, If thou castist out vs fro hennes, sende vs in to the droue of swyne.
23378	40	8	32	And he seide to hem, Go ye. And thei yeden out, and wenten in to the swyne; and loo! in a greet bire al the droue wente heedlyng in to the see, and thei weren deed in the watris.
23379	40	8	33	And the hirdis fledden awey, and camen in to the citee, and telden alle these thingis, and of hem that hadden the feendis.
23380	40	8	34	And lo! al the citee wente out ayens Jhesu; and whanne thei hadden seyn hym, thei preieden, that he wolde passe fro her coostis.
23381	40	9	1	And Jhesus wente vp in to a boot, and passide ouer the watir, and cam in to his citee.
23382	40	9	2	And lo! thei brouyten to hym a man sike in palesie, liggynge in a bed. And Jhesus saw the feith of hem, and seide to the man sike in palesye, Sone, haue thou trist; thi synnes ben foryouun to thee.
23383	40	9	3	And lo! summe of the scribis seiden withynne hem silf, This blasfemeth.
23384	40	9	4	And whanne Jhesus hadde seyn her thouytis, he seide, Wherto thenken ye yuele thingis in youre hertis?
23385	40	9	5	What is liytere to seye, Thi synnes ben foryouun to thee, ethir `to seie, Rise thou, and walke?
23386	40	9	6	But that ye wite that mannus sone hath power to foryyue synnes in erthe, thanne he seide to the sijk man in palesie, Rise vp; take thi bed, and go in to thin hous.
23387	40	9	7	And he roos, and wente in to his hous.
23388	40	9	8	And the puple seynge dredde, and glorifiede God, that yaf suche power to men.
23389	40	9	9	And whanne Jhesus passide fro thennus, he say a man, Matheu bi name, sittynge in a tolbothe. And he seide to hym, Sue thou me.
23390	40	9	10	And he roos, and folewide hym. And it was don, the while he sat `at the mete in the hous, lo! many pupplicans and synful men camen, and saten `at the mete with Jhesu and hise disciplis.
23391	40	9	11	And Farisees sien, and seiden to hise disciplis, Whi etith youre maister with pupplicans and synful men?
23392	40	9	12	And Jhesus herde, and seide, A leche is not nedeful to men that faren wel, but to men that ben yuel at ese.
23393	40	9	13	But go ye, and lerne what it is, Y wole merci, and not sacrifice; for I cam, not to clepe riytful men, but synful men.
23394	40	9	14	Thanne the disciplis of Joon camen to hym, and seiden, Whi we and Farisees fasten ofte, but thi disciplis fasten not?
23395	40	9	15	And Jhesus seide to hem, Whether the sones of the spouse moun morne, as long as the spouse is with hem? But daies schulen come, whanne the spouse schal be takun a wei fro hem, and thanne thei schulen faste.
23396	40	9	16	And no man putteth a clout of buystous clothe in to an elde clothing; for it doith awey the fulnesse of the cloth, and a wers breking is maad.
23397	40	9	17	Nethir men putten newe wyne in to elde botelis, ellis the botels ben to-broke, and distried, and the wyn sched out. But men putten newe wyne in to newe botels, and bothe ben kept.
23398	40	9	18	Whiles that Jhesus spak thes thingis to hem, lo! a prince cam, and worschipide hym, and seide, Lord, my douyter is now deed; but come thou, and putte thin hond on hir, and she schal lyue.
23399	40	9	19	And Jhesus roos, and `hise disciplis, and sueden hym.
23400	40	9	20	And lo! a womman, that hadde the blodi flux twelue yere, neiyede bihynde, and touchide the hem of his cloth.
23401	40	9	21	For sche seide with ynne hir self, Yif Y touche oonli the cloth of hym, Y schal be saaf.
23402	40	9	22	And Jhesus turnede, and say hir, and seide, Douytir, haue thou trist; thi feith hath maad thee saaf. And the womman was hool fro that our.
23403	40	9	23	And whanne Jhesus cam in to the hous of the prince, and say mynstrallis, and the puple makynge noise,
23404	40	9	24	he seide, Go ye a wei, for the damysel is not deed, but slepith. And thei scornyden hym.
23405	40	9	25	And whanne the folc was put out, he wente in, and helde hir hond; and the damysel roos.
23406	40	9	26	And this fame wente out in to al that loond.
23407	40	9	27	And whanne Jhesus passide fro thennus, twei blynde men criynge sueden hym, and seiden, Thou sone of Dauid, haue merci on vs.
23408	40	9	28	And whanne he cam in to the hous, the blynde men camen to hym; and Jhesus seide to hem, What wolen ye, that I do to you? And thei seiden, Lord, that oure iyen be opened. And Jhesus seide, Bileuen ye, that Y mai do this thing to you? Thei seien to him, Yhe, Lord.
23409	40	9	29	Thanne he touchide her iyen, and seide, Aftir youre feith be it doon to you.
23410	40	9	30	And the iyen of hem were opened. And Jhesus thretenede hem, and seide, Se ye, that no man wite.
23411	40	9	31	But thei yeden out, and diffameden hym thorou al that lond.
23412	40	9	32	And whanne thei weren gon out, loo! thei brouyten to hym a doumbe man, hauynge a deuel.
23413	40	9	33	And whanne the deuel was cast out, the doumb man spak. And the puple wondride, and seide, It hath not be say thus in Israel.
23414	40	9	34	But the Farisees seiden, In the prince of deuelis he castith out deuelis.
23415	40	9	35	And Jhesus wente `aboute alle the `citees and castels, techinge in the synagogis of hem, and prechynge the gospel of the kyngdom, and helynge euery langour and euery sijknesse.
23416	40	9	36	And he siy the puple, and hadde reuthe on hem; for thei weren trauelid, and liggynge as scheep not hauynge a scheepherde.
23417	40	9	37	Thanne he seide to hise disciplis, Sotheli there is myche ripe corn, but fewe werk men.
23418	40	9	38	Therfor preye ye the lord of the ripe corn, that he sende werke men in to his ripe corn.
23419	40	10	1	And whanne his twelue disciplis weren clepid togidere, he yaf to hem powere of vnclene spiritis, to caste hem out of men, and to heele eueri langour, and sijknesse.
23420	40	10	2	And these ben the names of the twelue apostlis; the firste, Symount, that is clepid Petre, and Andrew, his brothir; James of Zebede, and Joon, his brothir; Filip, and Bartholomeu;
23421	40	10	3	Thomas, and Matheu, pupplican; and James Alfey, and Tadee;
23422	40	10	4	Symount Chananee, and Judas Scarioth, that bitrayede Crist.
23423	40	10	5	Jhesus sente these twelue, and comaundide hem, and seide, Go ye not `in to the weie of hethene men, and entre ye not in to the citees of Samaritans;
23424	40	10	6	but rather go ye to the scheep of the hous of Israel, that han perischid.
23425	40	10	7	And go ye, and preche ye, and seie, that the kyngdam of heuenes shal neiye;
23426	40	10	8	heele ye sike men, reise ye deede men, clense ye mesels, caste ye out deuelis; freeli ye han takun, freli yyue ye.
23427	40	10	9	Nyle ye welde gold, nether siluer, ne money in youre girdlis, not a scrippe in the weie,
23428	40	10	10	nether twei cootis, nethir shoon, nether a yerde; for a werkman is worthi his mete.
23429	40	10	11	In to what euere citee or castel ye schulen entre, axe ye who therynne is worthi, and there dwelle ye, til ye go out.
23430	40	10	12	And whanne ye goon in to an hous, `grete ye it, and seyn, Pees to this hous.
23431	40	10	13	And if thilk hous be worthi, youre pees schal come on it; but if that hous be not worthi, youre pees schal turne ayen to you.
23432	40	10	14	And who euere resseyueth not you, nethir herith youre wordis, go ye fro that hous or citee, and sprenge of the dust of youre feet.
23433	40	10	15	Treuly Y seie to you, it shal be more suffrable to the loond of men of Sodom and of Gommor in the dai of iugement, than to thilke citee.
23434	40	10	16	Lo! Y sende you as scheep in the myddil of wolues; therfor be ye sliy as serpentis, and symple as dowues.
23435	40	10	17	But be ye war of men, for thei schulen take you in counseilis, and thei schulen bete you in her synagogis;
23436	40	10	18	and to meyris, or presidentis, and to kyngis, ye schulen be lad for me, in witnessyng to hem, and to the hethen men.
23437	40	10	19	But whanne thei take you, nyle ye thenke, hou or what thing ye schulen speke, for it shal be youun `to you in that our, what ye schulen speke;
23438	40	10	20	for it ben not ye that speken, but the spirit of youre fadir, that spekith in you.
23439	40	10	21	`And the brother shal take the brother in to deeth, and the fader the sone, and sones schulen rise ayens fadir and modir, and schulen turmente hem bi deeth.
23440	40	10	22	And ye schulen be in hate to alle men for my name; but he that shall dwelle stille in to the ende, shal be saaf.
23441	40	10	23	And whanne thei pursuen you in this citee, fle ye in to anothir. Treuli Y seie to you, ye schulen not ende the citees of Israel, to for that mannus sone come.
23442	40	10	24	The disciple is not aboue the maistir, ne the seruaunt aboue hys lord;
23443	40	10	25	it is ynowy to the disciple, that he be as his maistir, and to the seruaunt as his lord. If thei han clepid the hosebonde man Belsabub, hou myche more his houshold meyne?
23444	40	10	26	Therfor drede ye not hem; for no thing is hid, that schal not be shewid; and no thing is priuey, that schal not be wist.
23445	40	10	27	That thing that Y seie to you in derknessis, seie ye in the liyt; and preche ye on housis, that thing that ye heeren in the ere.
23446	40	10	28	And nyle ye drede hem that sleen the bodi; for thei moun not sle the soule; but rather drede ye hym, that mai lese bothe soule and bodi in to helle.
23447	40	10	29	Whether twei sparewis ben not seeld for an halpeny? and oon of hem shal not falle on the erthe with outen youre fadir.
23448	40	10	30	`And alle the heeris of youre heed ben noumbrid. Therfor nyle ye drede; ye ben betere than many sparewis.
23449	40	10	31	Therfor euery man that schal knouleche me bifore men, Y schal knouleche hym bifor my fadir that is in heuenes.
23450	40	10	33	But he that shal denye me bifor men, and I shal denye him bifor my fadir that is in heuenes.
23451	40	10	34	Nile ye deme, that Y cam to sende pees in to erthe; Y cam not to sende pees, but swerd.
23452	40	10	35	For Y cam to departe a man ayens his fadir, and the douytir ayens hir modir, and the sones wijf ayens the housbondis modir;
23453	40	10	36	and the enemyes of a man ben `thei, that ben homeli with him.
23454	40	10	37	He that loueth fadir or modir more than me, is not worthi to me. And he that loueth sone or douyter ouer me, is not worthi to me.
23455	40	10	38	And he that takith not his croos, and sueth me, is not worthi to me.
23456	40	10	39	He that fyndith his lijf, shal lose it; and he that lesith his lijf for me, shal fynde it.
23457	40	10	40	He that resseyueth you, resseyueth me; and he that resseyueth me, resseyueth hym that sente me.
23458	40	10	41	He that resseyueth a prophete in the name of a prophete, shal take the mede of a prophete. And he that resseyueth a iust man in the name of a iust man, schal take the mede of a iust man.
23459	40	10	42	And who euer yyueth drynke to oon of these leeste a cuppe of coolde watir oonli in the name of a disciple, treuli Y seie to you, he shal not leese his mede.
23460	40	11	1	And it was doon, whanne Jhesus hadde endid, he comaundide to hise twelue disciplis, and passide fro thennus to teche and preche in the citees of hem.
23461	40	11	2	But whanne Joon in boondis hadde herd the werkis of Crist, he sente tweyne of hise disciplis,
23462	40	11	3	and seide to him, `Art thou he that schal come, or we abiden another?
23463	40	11	4	And Jhesus answeride, and seide `to hem, Go ye, and telle ayen to Joon tho thingis that ye han herd and seyn.
23464	40	11	5	Blynde men seen, crokid men goon, meselis ben maad clene, deefe men heren, deed men rysen ayen, pore men ben takun to `prechyng of the gospel.
23465	40	11	6	And he is blessid, that shal not be sclaundrid in me.
23466	40	11	7	And whanne thei weren goon awei, Jhesus bigan to seie of Joon to the puple, What thing wenten ye out in to desert to se? a reed wawed with the wynd?
23467	40	11	8	Or what thing wenten ye out to see? a man clothid with softe clothis? Lo! thei that ben clothid with softe clothis ben in the housis of kyngis.
23468	40	11	9	But what thing wenten ye out to se? a prophete? Yhe, Y seie to you, and more than a prophete.
23469	40	11	10	For this is he, of whom it is writun, Lo! Y sende myn aungel bifor thi face, that shal make redi thi weye bifor thee.
23470	40	11	11	Treuli Y seie to you, ther roos noon more than Joon Baptist among the children of wymmen; but he that is lesse in the kyngdom of heuenes, is more than he.
23471	40	11	12	And fro the daies of Joon Baptist til now the kyngdom of heuenes suffrith violence, and violent men rauyschen it.
23472	40	11	13	For alle prophetis and the lawe `til to Joon prophecieden; and if ye wolen resseyue,
23473	40	11	14	he is Elie that is to come.
23474	40	11	15	He that hath eris of heryng, here he.
23475	40	11	16	But to whom schal Y gesse this generacioun lijk? It is lijk to children sittynge in chepyng, that crien to her peeris,
23476	40	11	17	and seien, We han songun to you, and ye han not daunsid; we han morned to you, and ye han not weilid.
23477	40	11	18	For Joon cam nether etynge ne drynkynge, and thei seien, He hath a deuel.
23478	40	11	19	The sone of man cam etynge and drynkynge, and thei seien, Lo! a man a glotoun, and a drinkere of wijne, and a freend of pupplicans and of synful men. And wisdom is iustified of her sones.
23479	40	11	20	Thanne Jhesus bigan to seye repreef to citees, in whiche ful manye vertues of him weren doon, for thei diden not penaunce.
23480	40	11	21	Wo to thee! Corosaym, woo to thee! Bethsaida; for if the vertues that ben doon in you hadden be doon in Tyre and Sidon, sumtyme thei hadden don penaunce in heyre and aische.
23481	40	11	22	Netheles Y seie to you, it schal be lesse peyne to Tire and Sidon in the dai of doom, than to you.
23482	40	11	23	And thou, Cafarnaum, whethir thou schalt be arerid vp in to heuene? Thou shalt go doun in to helle. For if the vertues that ben don in thee, hadden be don in Sodom, perauenture thei schulden haue dwellid `in to this dai.
23483	40	11	24	Netheles Y seie to you, that to the lond of Sodom it schal be `lesse peyne in the dai of doom, than to thee.
23484	40	11	25	In thilke tyme Jhesus answeride, and seide, Y knowleche to thee, fadir, lord of heuene and of erthe, for thou hast hid these thingis fro wijse men, and redi, and hast schewid hem to litle children;
23485	40	11	26	so, fadir, for so it was plesynge tofore thee.
23486	40	11	27	Alle thingis ben youune to me of my fadir; and no man knewe the sone, but the fadir, nethir ony man knewe the fadir, but the sone, and to whom the sone wolde schewe.
23487	40	11	28	Alle ye that traueilen, and ben chargid, come to me, and Y schal fulfille you.
23488	40	11	29	Take ye my yok on you, and lerne ye of me, for Y am mylde and meke in herte; and ye schulen fynde reste to youre soulis.
23489	40	11	30	`For my yok is softe, and my charge liyt.
23490	40	12	1	In that tyme Jhesus wente bi cornes in the sabot day; and hise disciplis hungriden, and bigunnen to plucke the eris of corn, and to ete.
23491	40	12	2	And Fariseis, seynge, seiden to hym, Lo! thi disciplis don that thing that is not leueful to hem to do in sabatis.
23492	40	12	3	And he seide to hem, Whether ye han not red, what Dauid dide, whanne he hungride, and thei that weren with hym?
23493	40	12	4	hou he entride in to the hous of God, and eet looues of proposicioun, whiche looues it was not leueful to hym to ete, nether to hem that weren with hym, but to prestis aloone?
23494	40	12	5	Or whether ye han not red in the lawe, that in sabotis prestis in the temple defoulen the sabotis, and thei ben with oute blame?
23495	40	12	6	And Y seie to you, that here is a gretter than the temple.
23496	40	12	7	And if ye wisten, what it is, Y wole merci, and not sacrifice, ye schulden neuer haue condempned innocentis.
23497	40	12	8	For mannus Sone is lord, yhe, of the sabat.
23498	40	12	9	And whanne he passide fro thennus, he cam in to the synagoge of hem.
23499	40	12	10	And lo! a man that hadde a drye hoond. And thei axiden hym, and seiden, Whether it be leueful to hele in the sabot? that thei schulden acuse hym.
23500	40	12	11	And he seide to hem, What man of you schal be, that hath o scheep, and if it falle in to a diche in the sabotis, whether he shal not holde, and lifte it vp?
23501	40	12	12	How myche more is a man better than a scheep? Therfor it is leueful to do good in the sabatis.
23502	40	12	13	Thanne he seide to the man, Stretche forth thin hoond. And he strauyte forth; and it was restorid to heelthe as the tothir.
23503	40	12	14	And the Farisees wenten out, and maden a counsel ayens hym, hou thei schulden distrie hym.
23504	40	12	15	And Jhesus knewe it, and wente awei fro thennus; and many sueden hym, and he helide hem alle.
23505	40	12	16	And he comaundide to hem, that thei schulden not make hym knowun;
23506	40	12	17	that that thing were fulfillid, that was seid by Isaie, the prophete, seiynge, Lo!
23507	40	12	18	my child, whom Y haue chosun, my derling, in whom it hath wel plesid to my soule; Y shal put my spirit on him, and he shal telle dom to hethen men.
23508	40	12	19	He shal not stryue, ne crye, nethir ony man shal here his voice in stretis.
23509	40	12	20	A brisid rehed he shal not breke, and he schal not quenche smokynge flax, til he caste out doom to victorie;
23510	40	12	21	and hethene men schulen hope in his name.
23511	40	12	22	Thanne a man blynde and doumbe, that hadde a feend, was brouyt to hym; and he helide hym, so that he spak, and say.
23512	40	12	23	And al the puple wondride, and seide, Whether this be the sone of Dauid?
23513	40	12	24	But the Farisees herden, and seiden, He this casteth not out feendis, but in Belsabub, prince of feendis.
23514	40	12	25	And Jhesus, witynge her thouytis, seide to hem, Eche kingdom departid ayens it silf, schal be desolatid, and eche cite, or hous, departid ayens it self, schal not stonde.
23515	40	12	26	And if Satanas castith out Satanas, he is departid ayens him silf; therfor hou schal his kingdom stonde?
23516	40	12	27	And if Y in Belsabub caste out deuelis, in `whom youre sones casten out? Therfor thei schulen be youre domes men.
23517	40	12	28	But if Y in the Spirit of God caste out feendis, thanne the kyngdom of God is comen in to you.
23518	40	12	29	Ethir hou may ony man entre in to the hous of a stronge man, and take awey hise vesselis, but `he first bynde the stronge man, and thanne he schal spuyle his hous?
23519	40	12	30	He that is not with me, is ayens me; and he that gaderith not togidere with me, scaterith abrood.
23520	40	12	31	Therfor I seie to you, al synne and blasfemye shal be foryouun to men, but `the spirit of blasfemye shal not be foryouun.
23521	40	12	32	And who euere seith a word ayens mannus sone, it shal be foryouun to him; but who that seieth a word ayens the Hooli Goost, it shal not be foryouun to hym, nether in this world, ne in `the tothir.
23522	40	12	33	Ethir make ye the tree good, and his fruyt good; ether make ye the tree yuel and his fruyt yuel; for a tree is knowun of the fruyt.
23523	40	12	34	Ye generacioun of eddris, hou moun ye speke goode thingis, whanne ye ben yuele? For the mouth spekith of plente of the herte.
23524	40	12	35	A good man bryngith forth good thingis of good tresoure, and an yuel man bringith forth yuel thingis of yuel tresoure.
23525	40	12	36	And Y seie to you, that of euery idel word, that men speken, thei schulen yelde resoun therof in the dai of doom;
23526	40	12	37	for of thi wordis thou schalt be iustified, and of thi wordis thou shalt be dampned.
23527	40	12	38	Thanne summe of the scribis and Farisees answeriden to hym, and seiden, Mayster, we wolen se a tokne of thee.
23528	40	12	39	Which answeride, and seide to hem, An yuel kynrede and a spouse brekere sekith a tokene, and a tokene shal not be youun to it, but the tokene of Jonas, the prophete.
23529	40	12	40	For as Jonas was in the wombe of a whal thre daies and thre nyytis, so mannus sone shal be in the herte of the erthe thre daies and thre nyytis.
23530	40	12	41	Men of Nynyue schulen rise in doom with this generacioun, and schulen condempne it; for thei diden penaunce in the prechyng of Jonas, and lo! here a gretter than Jonas.
23531	40	12	42	The queene of the south shal rise in doom with this generacioun, and schal condempne it; for she cam fro the eendis of the erthe to here the wisdom of Salomon, and lo! here a gretter than Salomon.
23532	40	12	43	Whanne an vnclene spirit goith out fro a man, he goith bi drie places, `and sekith rest, and fyndith not.
23533	40	12	44	Thanne he seith, Y shal turne ayen in to myn hous, fro whannys Y wente out. And he cometh, and fyndith it voide, and clensid with besyms, and maad faire.
23534	40	12	45	Thanne he goith, and takith with him seuene othere spiritis worse than hym silf; and thei entren, and dwellen there. And the laste thingis of that man ben maad worse than the formere. So it shal be to this worste generacioun.
23535	40	12	46	Yit whil he spak to the puple, lo! his modir and his bretheren stoden withouteforth, sekynge to speke to hym.
23536	40	12	47	And a man seide to hym, Lo! thi modir and thi britheren stonden withouteforth, sekynge thee.
23537	40	12	48	He answeride to the man, that spak to hym, and seide, Who is my modir? and who ben my britheren?
23538	40	12	49	And he helde forth his hoond in to hise disciplis, and seide, Lo! my modir and my bretheren;
23539	40	12	50	for who euer doith the wille of my fadir that is in heuenes, he is my brothir, and sistir, and modir.
23540	40	13	1	In that dai Jhesus yede out of the hous, and sat bisidis the see.
23541	40	13	2	And myche puple was gaderid to hym, so that he wente up in to a boot, and sat; and al the puple stood on the brenke.
23542	40	13	3	And he spac to hem many thingis in parablis, and seide, Lo! he that sowith, yede out to sowe his seed.
23543	40	13	4	And while he sowith, summe seedis felden bisidis the weie, and briddis of the eir camen, and eeten hem.
23544	40	13	5	But othere seedis felden in to stony places, where thei hadden not myche erthe; and anoon thei sprongen vp, for thei hadden not depnesse of erthe.
23545	40	13	6	But whanne the sonne was risun, thei swaliden, and for thei hadden not roote, thei drieden vp.
23546	40	13	7	And other seedis felden among thornes; and thornes woxen vp, and strangeleden hem.
23547	40	13	8	But othere seedis felden in to good lond, and yauen fruyt; summe an hundrid foold, an othir sixti foold, an othir thritti foold.
23548	40	13	9	He that hath eris of heryng, here he.
23549	40	13	10	And the disciplis camen nyy, and seiden to him, Whi spekist thou in parablis to hem?
23550	40	13	11	And he answeride, and seide to hem, `For to you it is youun to knowe the priuytees of the kyngdom of heuenes; but it is not youun to hem.
23551	40	13	12	For it shal be youun to hym that hath, and he shal haue plente; but if a man hath not, also that thing that he hath shal be takun awei fro hym.
23552	40	13	13	Therfor Y speke to hem in parablis, for thei seynge seen not, and thei herynge heren not, nether vndurstonden;
23553	40	13	14	that the prophesie of Ysaie `seiynge be fulfillid `in hem, With heryng ye schulen here, and ye shulen not vndurstonde; and ye seynge schulen se, and ye shulen not se;
23554	40	13	15	for the herte of this puple is greetli fattid, and thei herden heuyli with eeris, and thei han closed her iyen, lest sumtime thei seen with iyen, and with eeris heeren, and vndirstonden in herte, and thei be conuertid, and Y heele hem.
23555	40	13	16	But youre iyen that seen ben blesside, and youre eeris that heren.
23556	40	13	17	Forsothe Y seie to you, that manye profetis and iust men coueitiden to se tho thingis that ye seen, and thei sayn not, and to heere tho thingis that ye heren, and thei herden not.
23557	40	13	18	Therfor here ye the parable of the sowere.
23558	40	13	19	Ech that herith the word of the rewme, and vndirstondith not, the yuel spirit cometh, and rauyschith that that is sowun in his herte; this it is, that is sowun bisidis the weie.
23559	40	13	20	But this that is sowun on the stony loond, this it is, that herith the word of God, and anoon with ioye takith it.
23560	40	13	21	And he hath not roote in hym silf, but is temporal. For whanne tribulacioun and persecucioun is maad for the word, anoon he is sclaundrid.
23561	40	13	22	But he that is sowun in thornes, is this that heerith the word, and the bisynesse of this world, and the fallace of ritchessis strangulith the word, and it is maad with outen fruyt.
23562	40	13	23	But he that is sowun in to good loond, is this that herith the word, and vnderstondeth, and bryngith forth fruyt. And summe makith an hundrid fold, treuli anothir sixti fold, and another thritti fold.
23563	40	13	24	Anothir parable Jhesus puttide forth to hem, and seide, The kyngdom of heuenes is maad lijk to a man, that sewe good seed in his feld.
23564	40	13	25	And whanne men slepten, his enemy cam, and sewe aboue taris in the myddil of whete, and wente awei.
23565	40	13	26	But whanne the erbe was growed, and made fruyt, thanne the taris apperiden.
23566	40	13	27	And the seruauntis of the hosebonde man camen, and seiden to hym, Lord, whether hast thou not sowun good seed in thi feeld? where of thanne hath it taris?
23567	40	13	28	And he seide to hem, An enemy hath do this thing. And the seruauntis seiden to him, `Wolt thou that we goon, and gaderen hem?
23568	40	13	29	And he seide, Nay, lest perauenture ye in gaderynge taris drawen vp with hem the whete bi the roote.
23569	40	13	30	Suffre ye hem bothe to wexe in to repyng tyme; and in the tyme of ripe corne Y shal seie to the reperis, First gadere ye to gidere the taris, and bynde hem to gidere in knytchis to be brent, but gadere ye whete in to my berne.
23570	40	13	31	Another parable Jhesus puttide forth to hem, and seide, The kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to a corn of seneuey, which a man took, and sewe in his feeld.
23571	40	13	32	Which is the leeste of alle seedis, but whanne it hath woxen, it is the moste of alle wortis, and is maad a tre; so that briddis of the eir comen, and dwellen in the bowis therof.
23572	40	13	33	Another parable Jhesus spac to hem, The kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to sour douy, which a womman took, and hidde in thre mesuris of mele, til it were alle sowrid.
23573	40	13	34	Jhesus spac alle thes thingis in parablis to the puple, and he spac not to hem with out parablis, that it schulde be fulfillid,
23574	40	13	35	that is seid bi the prophete, seiynge, Y shal opene my mouth in parablis; Y shal telle out hid thingis fro the makyng of the world.
23575	40	13	36	Thanne he lefte the puple, and cam in to an hous; and hise disciplis camen to him, and seiden, Expowne to vs the parable of taris of the feeld.
23576	40	13	37	Which answeride, and seide, He that sowith good seed is mannus sone;
23577	40	13	38	the feeld is the world; but the good seed, these ben sones of the kyngdom, but taris, these ben yuele children;
23578	40	13	39	the enemye that sowith hem is the feend; and the ripe corn is the endyng of the world, the reperis ben aungels.
23579	40	13	40	Therfor as taris ben gaderid togidere, and ben brent in fier, so it shal be in the endyng of the world.
23580	40	13	41	Mannus sone shal sende hise aungels, and thei schulen gadere fro his rewme alle sclaundris, and hem that doon wickidnesse;
23581	40	13	42	and thei schulen sende hem in to the chymney of fier, there shal be weping and betyng to gidere of teeth.
23582	40	13	43	Thanne iuste men schulen schyne as the sunne, in the rewme of her fadir. He that hath eeris of heryng, here he.
23583	40	13	44	The kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to tresour hid in a feld, which a man that fyndith, hidith; and for ioye of it he goith, and sillith alle thingis that he hath, and bieth thilk feeld.
23584	40	13	45	Eftsoone the kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to a marchaunt, that sechith good margaritis;
23585	40	13	46	but whanne he hath foundun o precious margarite, he wente, and selde alle thingis that he hadde, and bouyte it.
23586	40	13	47	Eft the kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to a nette cast into the see, and that gaderith to gidere of al kynde of fisschis;
23587	40	13	48	which whanne it was ful, thei drowen vp, and seten bi the brenke, and chesen the goode in to her vessels, but the yuel thei kesten out.
23588	40	13	49	So it schal be in the endyng of the world. Aungels schulen go out, and schulen departe yuel men fro the myddil of iuste men.
23589	40	13	50	And thei shulen sende hem in to the chymnei of fier; ther shal be weping and gryntyng of teeth.
23590	40	13	51	Han ye vndirstonde alle these thingis? Thei seien to hym, Yhe.
23591	40	13	52	He seith to hem, Therfor euery wise man of lawe in the kyngdom of heuenes, is lijk to an hosebonde man, that bryngith forth of his tresoure newe thingis and elde.
23592	40	13	53	And it was doon, whanne Jhesus hadde endid these parablis, he passide fro thennus.
23593	40	13	54	And he cam in to his cuntrei, and tauyte hem in her synagogis, so that thei wondriden, and seiden, Fro whennus this wisdam and vertues camen to this?
23594	40	13	55	Whether `is not this the sone of a carpentere? Whether his modir be not seid Marie? and hise britheren, James, and Joseph, and Symount, and Judas? and hise sistris,
23595	40	13	56	whether thei alle ben not among us? Fro whennus thanne `alle thes thingis camen to this?
23596	40	13	57	And so thei weren sclaundrid in hym. But Jhesus seide to hem, A profete is not with oute worschip, but in his owen cuntre, and in his owen hous.
23597	40	13	58	And he dide not there manye vertues, for the vnbileue of hem.
23598	40	14	1	In that tyme Eroude tetrarke, prynce of the fourthe part, herde the fame of Jhesu;
23599	40	14	2	and seide to hise children, This is Joon Baptist, he is rysun fro deeth, and therfor vertues worchen in hym.
23600	40	14	3	For Heroude hadde holde Joon, and bounde hym, and puttide hym `in to prisoun for Herodias, the wijf of his brothir.
23601	40	14	4	For Joon seide to him, It is not leueful to thee to haue hir.
23602	40	14	5	And he willynge to sle hym, dredde the puple; for thei hadden hym as a prophete.
23603	40	14	6	But in the dai of Heroudis birthe, the douytir of Herodias daunside in the myddil, and pleside Heroude.
23604	40	14	7	Wherfor with an ooth he bihiyte to yyue to hir, what euere thing she hadde axid of hym.
23605	40	14	8	And she bifor warned of hir modir, seide, Yif thou to me here the heed of Joon Baptist in a disch.
23606	40	14	9	And the kyng was sorewful, but for the ooth, and for hem that saten to gidere at the mete, he comaundide to be youun.
23607	40	14	10	And he sente, and bihedide Joon in the prisoun.
23608	40	14	11	And his heed was brouyt in a dische, and it was youun to the damysel, and she bar it to hir modir.
23609	40	14	12	And hise disciplis camen, and token his bodi, and birieden it; and thei camen, and tolden to Jhesu.
23610	40	14	13	And whanne Jhesus hadde herd this thing, he wente fro thennus in a boot, in to desert place bisides. And whanne the puple hadde herd, thei folewiden hym on her feet fro citees.
23611	40	14	14	And Jhesus yede out, and sai a greet puple, and hadde reuthe on hem, and heelide the sike men of hem.
23612	40	14	15	But whanne the euentid was com, hise disciplis camen to him, and seiden, The place is desert, and the tyme is now passid; lat the puple go in to townes, to bye hem mete.
23613	40	14	16	Jhesus seide to hem, Thei han not nede to go; yyue ye hem sumwhat to ete.
23614	40	14	17	Thei answeriden, We han not heere, but fyue looues and twei fischis.
23615	40	14	18	And he seide to hem, Brynge ye hem hidur to me.
23616	40	14	19	And whanne he hadde comaundid the puple to sitte to meete on the heye, he took fyue looues and twei fischis, and he bihelde in to heuene, and blesside, and brak, and yaf to hise disciplis; and the disciplis yauen to the puple.
23617	40	14	20	And alle eten, and weren fulfillid. And thei tooken the relifs of brokun gobetis, twelue cofynes ful.
23618	40	14	21	And the noumbre of men that eten was fyue thousynde of men, outakun wymmen and lytle children.
23619	40	14	22	And anoon Jhesus compellide the disciplis to go vp in to a boot, and go bifor hym ouer the see, while he lefte the puple.
23620	40	14	23	And whanne the puple was left, he stiede aloone in to an hil for to preie. But whanne the euenyng was come, he was there aloone.
23621	40	14	24	And the boot in the myddel of the see was schoggid with wawis, for the wynd was contrarie to hem.
23622	40	14	25	But in the fourthe wakyng of the niyt, he cam to hem walkynge aboue the see.
23623	40	14	26	And thei, seynge hym walking on the see, weren disturblid, and seiden, That it is a fantum; and for drede thei crieden.
23624	40	14	27	And anoon Jhesus spac to hem, and seide, Haue ye trust, Y am; nyle ye drede.
23625	40	14	28	And Petre answeride, and seide, Lord, if thou art, comaunde me to come to thee on the watris.
23626	40	14	29	And he seide, Come thou. And Petre yede doun fro the boot, and walkide on the watris to come to Jhesu.
23627	40	14	30	But he siy the wynd strong, and was aferde; and whanne he bigan to drenche, he criede, and seide, Lord, make me saaf.
23628	40	14	31	And anoon Jhesus helde forth his hoond, and took Petre, and seide to hym, Thou of litil feith, whi hast thou doutid?
23629	40	14	32	And whanne he hadde stied in to the boot, the wynd ceessid.
23630	40	14	33	And thei, that weren in the boot, camen, and worschipiden hym, and seiden, Verili, thou art Goddis sone.
23631	40	14	34	And whanne thei hadden passid ouer the see, thei camen in to the loond of Genesar.
23632	40	14	35	And whanne men of that place hadden knowe hym, thei senten in to al that cuntre; and thei brouyten to hym alle that hadden siknesse.
23633	40	14	36	And thei preieden hym, that thei schulden touche the hemme of his clothing; and who euere touchiden weren maad saaf.
23634	40	15	1	Thanne the scribis and the Farisees camen to hym fro Jerusalem, and seiden,
23635	40	15	2	Whi breken thi disciplis the tradiciouns of eldere men? for thei waisschen not her hondis, whanne thei eten breed.
23636	40	15	3	He answeride, and seide to hem, Whi breken ye the maundement of God for youre tradicioun?
23637	40	15	4	For God seide, Honoure thi fadir and thi modir, and he that cursith fadir or modir, die bi deeth.
23638	40	15	5	But ye seien, Who euer seith to fadir or modir, What euere yifte is of me, it schal profite to thee;
23639	40	15	6	and he hath not worschipid his fadir or his modir; and ye han maad the maundement of God voide for youre tradicioun.
23640	40	15	7	Ypocritis, Isaie, the prophete, prophesiede wel of you,
23641	40	15	8	and seide, This puple honourith me with lippis, but her herte is fer fro me;
23642	40	15	9	and thei worschipen me `with outen cause, techynge the doctrines and maundementis of men.
23643	40	15	10	And whanne the puple weren clepid to gidere to hym, he seide to hem, Here ye, and `vndurstonde ye.
23644	40	15	11	That thing that entrith in to the mouth, defoulith not a man; but that thing that cometh out of the mouth, defoulith a man.
23645	40	15	12	Thanne hise disciplis camen, and seiden to hym, Thou knowist, that, if this word be herd, the Farisees ben sclaundrid?
23646	40	15	13	And he answeride, and seide, Eueri plauntyng, that my fadir of heuene hath not plauntid, shal be drawun vp by the roote.
23647	40	15	14	Suffre ye hem; thei ben blynde, and leederis of blynde men. And if a blynd man lede a blynd man, bothe fallen doun in to the diche.
23648	40	15	15	Petre answeride, and seide to hym, Expowne to vs this parable.
23649	40	15	16	And he seide, Yit `ye ben also with oute vndurstondyng?
23650	40	15	17	Vndurstonden ye not, that al thing that entrith in to the mouth, goith in to the wombe, and is sent out in to the goyng awei?
23651	40	15	18	But tho thingis that comen forth fro the mouth, goon out of the herte, and tho thingis defoulen a man.
23652	40	15	19	For of the herte goon out yuele thouytis, mansleyngis, auowtries, fornycaciouns, theftis, fals witnessyngis, blasfemyes.
23653	40	15	20	Thes thingis it ben that defoulen a man; but to ete with hondis not waischun, defoulith not a man.
23654	40	15	21	And Jhesus yede out fro thennus, and wente in to the coostis of Tire and Sidon.
23655	40	15	22	And lo! a womman of Canane yede out of tho coostis, and criede, and seide to him, Lord, the sone of Dauid, haue merci on me; my douyter is yuel traueilid of a feend.
23656	40	15	23	And he answeride not to hir a word. And hise disciplis camen, and preieden hym, and seiden, Leue thou hir, for she crieth aftir vs.
23657	40	15	24	He answeride, and seide, Y am not sent, but to the scheep of the hous of Israel that perischiden.
23658	40	15	25	And she cam, and worschipide hym, and seide, Lord, helpe me.
23659	40	15	26	Which answeride, and seide, It is not good to take the breed of children, and caste to houndis.
23660	40	15	27	And she seide, Yhis, Lord; for whelpis eten of the crummes, that fallen doun fro the bord of her lordis.
23661	40	15	28	Thanne Jhesus answeride, and seide to hir, A! womman, thi feith is greet; be it doon to thee, as thou wolt. And hir douytir was helid fro that hour.
23662	40	15	29	And whanne Jhesus hadde passed fro thennus, he cam bisidis the see of Galilee. And he yede vp in to an hil, and sat there.
23663	40	15	30	And myche puple cam to hym, and hadden with hem doumbe men and crokid, feble and blynde, and many other; and thei castiden doun hem at hise feet. And he helide hem,
23664	40	15	31	so that the puple wondriden seynge doumbe men spekynge, and crokid goynge, blynde men seynge; and thei magnyfieden God of Israel.
23665	40	15	32	And Jhesus, whanne hise disciplis weren clepid to gidere, seide to hem, Y haue reuthe of the puple, for thei han abiden now thre daies with me, and han no thing to ete; and Y wole not leeue hem fastynge, lest thei failen in the weie.
23666	40	15	33	And the disciplis seien to him, Wherof thanne so many looues among vs in desert, to fulfille so greet a puple?
23667	40	15	34	And Jhesus seide to hem, Hou many looues han ye? And thei seiden, Seuene, and a fewe smale fisshis.
23668	40	15	35	And he comaundide to the puple, to sitte to mete on the erthe.
23669	40	15	36	And he took seuene looues and fyue fischis, and dide thankyngis, and brak, and yaf to hise disciplis; and the disciplis yauen to the puple.
23670	40	15	37	And alle eten, and weren fulfillid, and thei token that that was left of relifes, seuene lepis fulle.
23671	40	15	38	And thei that eten weren foure thousynde of men, with outen litle children and wymmen.
23672	40	15	39	And whanne he hadde left the puple, he wente vp in to a boot, and cam in to the coostis of Magedan.
23673	40	16	1	And the Farisees and the Saducees camen to hym temptynge, and preieden hym to schewe hem a tokene fro heuene.
23674	40	16	2	And he answeride, and seide to hem, Whanne the euentid is comun, ye seien, It schal be clere, for heuene is rodi;
23675	40	16	3	and the morewtid, To dai tempest, for heuene schyneth heueli.
23676	40	16	4	Thanne ye kunne deme the face of heuene, but ye moun not wite the tokenes of tymes. An yuel generacioun and auoutresse sekith a tokene; and a tokene schal not be youun to it, but the tokene of Jonas, the profete. And whanne he hadde left hem, he wente forth.
23677	40	16	5	And whanne his disciplis camen ouer the see, thei foryaten to take looues.
23678	40	16	6	And he seide to hem, Biholde ye, and be war of the soure dowy of Farisees and Saducees.
23679	40	16	7	And thei thouyten among hem, and seiden, For we han not take looues.
23680	40	16	8	But Jhesus witynge seide to hem, What thenken ye among you of litel feith, for ye han not looues?
23681	40	16	9	Yit `vndurstonden not ye, nether han mynde of fyue looues in to fyue thousynde of men, and hou many cofyns ye token?
23682	40	16	10	nether of seuene looues in to foure thousynde of men, and hou many lepis ye token?
23683	40	16	11	Whi vndurstonden ye not, for Y seide not to you of breed, Be ye war of the sourdowy of Farisees and of Saducees?
23684	40	16	12	Thanne thei vndurstooden, that he seide not to be war of sourdowy of looues, but of the techyng of Farisees and Saducees.
23685	40	16	13	And Jhesus cam in to the parties of Cesarie of Filip, and axide hise disciplis, and seide, Whom seien men to be mannus sone?
23686	40	16	14	And thei seiden, Summe Joon Baptist; othere Elie; and othere Jeremye, or oon of the prophetis.
23687	40	16	15	Jhesus seide to hem, But whom seien ye me to be?
23688	40	16	16	Symount Petre answeride, and seide, Thou art Crist, the sone of God lyuynge.
23689	40	16	17	Jhesus answeride, and seide to him, Blessid art thou, Symount Bariona; for fleisch and blood schewide not to thee, but my fadir that is in heuenes.
23690	40	16	18	And Y seie to thee, that thou art Petre, and on this stoon Y schal bilde my chirche, and the yatis of helle schulen not haue miyt ayens it.
23691	40	16	19	And to thee Y shal yyue the keies of the kingdom of heuenes; and what euer thou shalt bynde on erthe, schal be boundun also in heuenes; and what euer thou schalt vnbynde on erthe, schal be vnbounden also in heuenes.
23692	40	16	20	Thanne he comaundide to hise disciplis, that thei schulden seie to no man, that he was Crist.
23693	40	16	21	Fro that tyme Jhesus bigan to schewe to hise disciplis, that it bihofte hym go to Jerusalem, and suffre many thingis, of the eldere men, and of scribis, and princis of prestis; and be slayn, and the thridde dai to rise ayen.
23694	40	16	22	And Petre took hym, and bigan to blame him, and seide, Fer be it fro thee, Lord; this thing schal not be to thee.
23695	40	16	23	And he turnede, and seide to Petre, Sathanas, go after me; thou art a sclaundre to me; for thou sauerist not tho thingis that ben of God, but tho thingis that ben of men.
23696	40	16	24	Thanne Jhesus seide to his disciplis, If ony man wole come after me, denye he hym silf, and take his cros, and sue me; for he that wole make his lijf saaf,
23697	40	16	25	shal leese it; and he that schal leese his lijf for me, schal fynde it.
23698	40	16	26	For what profitith it to a man, if he wynne al the world, and suffre peiryng of his soule? or what chaunging schal a man yyue for his soule?
23699	40	16	27	For mannes sone schal come in glorie of his fader, with his aungels, and thanne he schal yelde to ech man after his werkis.
23700	40	16	28	Treuli Y seie to you, `ther ben summe of hem that stonden here, whiche schulen not taste deth, til thei seen mannus sone comynge in his kyngdom.
23701	40	17	1	And after sixe daies Jhesus took Petre, and James, and Joon, his brother, and ledde hem aside in to an hiy hil,
23702	40	17	2	and was turned in to an othir licnesse bifor hem. And his face schone as the sunne; and hise clothis weren maad white as snowe.
23703	40	17	3	And lo! Moises and Elie apperiden to hem, and spaken with hym.
23704	40	17	4	And Petre answeride, and seide to Jhesu, Lord, it is good vs to be here. If thou wolt, make we here thre tabernaclis; to thee oon, to Moises oon, and oon to Elye. Yit the while he spak, lo!
23705	40	17	5	a briyt cloude ouerschadewide hem; and lo! a voice out of the cloude, that seide, This is my dereworth sone, in whom Y haue wel pleside to me; here ye hym.
23706	40	17	6	And the disciplis herden, and felden doun on her faces, and dredden greetli.
23707	40	17	7	And Jhesus cam, and touchide hem, and seide to hem, Rise vp, and nyle ye drede.
23708	40	17	8	And thei liften vp her iyen, and saien no man, but Jhesu aloone.
23709	40	17	9	And as thei camen doun of the hille, Jhesus comaundide to hem, and seide, Seie ye to no man the visioun, til mannus sone rise ayen fro deeth.
23710	40	17	10	And his disciplis axiden hym, and seiden, What thanne seien the scribis, that it bihoueth that Elie come first?
23711	40	17	11	He answeride, and seide to hem, Elie schal come, and he schal restore alle thingis.
23712	40	17	12	And Y seie to you, that Elie is nowe comun, and thei knewen hym not, but thei diden in him what euer thingis thei wolden; and so mannus sone schal suffre of hem.
23713	40	17	13	Thanne the disciplis vndurstoden, that he seide to hem of Joon Baptist.
23714	40	17	14	And whanne he cam to the puple, a man cam to hym, and felde doun on hise knees bifor hym, and seide, Lord, haue merci on my sone; for he is lunatike, and suffrith yuele, for ofte tymes he fallith in to the fier, and ofte tymes in to water.
23715	40	17	15	And Y brouyte hym to thi disciplis, and thei myyten not heele hym.
23716	40	17	16	Jhesus answeride, and seide, A! thou generacion vnbileueful and weiward; hou long schal Y be with you? hou long schal Y suffre you? Brynge ye hym hider to me.
23717	40	17	17	And Jhesus blamede hym, and the deuel wente out fro hym; and the child was heelid fro that our.
23718	40	17	18	Thanne the disciplis camen to Jhesu priueli, and seiden to hym, Whi myyten not we caste hym out?
23719	40	17	19	Jhesus seith to hem, For youre vnbileue. Treuli Y seie to you, if ye han feith, as a corn of seneueye, ye schulen seie to this hil, Passe thou hennus, and it schal passe; and no thing schal be vnpossible to you;
23720	40	17	20	but this kynde is not caste out, but bi preiyng and fastyng.
23721	40	17	21	And whilis thei weren abidynge togidere in Galilee, Jhesus seide to hem, Mannus sone schal be bitraied in to the hondis of men;
23722	40	17	22	and thei schulen sle hym, and the thridde day he schal rise ayen to lijf.
23723	40	17	23	And thei weren ful sori. And whanne thei camen to Cafarnaum, thei that token tribute, camen to Petre, and seiden to hym, Youre maister payeth not tribute?
23724	40	17	24	And he seide, Yhis. And whanne he was comen in to the hous, Jhesus cam bifor hym, and seide, Symount, what semeth to thee? Kyngis of erthe, of whom taken thei tribute? of her sones, ether of aliens?
23725	40	17	25	And he seide, Of aliens. Jhesus seide to hym, Thanne sones ben fre.
23726	40	17	26	But that we sclaundre hem not, go to the see, and caste an hook, and take thilke fisch that first cometh vp; and, whanne his mouth is opened, thou schalt fynde a stater, and yyue for thee and for me.
23727	40	18	1	In that our the disciplis camen to Jhesu, and seiden, Who, gessist thou, is gretter in the kyngdom of heuenes?
23728	40	18	2	And Jhesus clepide a litil child, and putte hym in the myddil of hem;
23729	40	18	3	and seide, Y seie treuthe to you, but ye be turned, and maad as litle children, ye schulen not entre in to the kyngdom of heuenes.
23730	40	18	4	Therfor who euer mekith hym as this litil child, he is gretter in the kyngdom of heuenes.
23731	40	18	5	And he that resseyueth o siche litil child in my name, resseyueth me.
23732	40	18	6	But who so sclaundrith oon of these smale, that bileuen in me, it spedith to hym that a mylnstoon `of assis be hangid in his necke, and he be drenchid in the depnesse of the see.
23733	40	18	7	Woo to the world, for sclaundris; for it is nede that sclaundris come; netheles wo to thilke man bi whom a sclaundre cometh.
23734	40	18	8	And if thin hoond or thi foot sclaundreth thee, kitte it of, and caste awei fro thee. It is betere to thee to entre to lijf feble, ethir crokid, than hauynge tweyne hoondis or twey feet to be sent in to euerlastynge fier.
23735	40	18	9	And if thin iye sclaundre thee, pulle it out, and caste awei fro thee. It is betere to thee with oon iye to entre in to lijf, thanne hauynge tweyn iyen to be sent in to the fier of helle.
23736	40	18	10	Se ye, that ye dispise not oon of these litle. For Y seie to you, that the aungels of hem in heuenes seen euermore the face of my fadir that is in heuenes.
23737	40	18	11	For mannus sone cam to saue that thing that perischide.
23738	40	18	12	What semeth to you? If ther weren to sum man an hundrid scheep, and oon of hem hath errid, whethir he schal not leeue nynti and nyne in desert, and schal go to seche that that erride?
23739	40	18	13	And if it falle that he fynde it, treuli Y seie to you, that he schal haue ioye theron more than on nynti and nyne that erriden not.
23740	40	18	14	So it is not the wille bifor youre fadir that is in heuenes, that oon of these litle perische.
23741	40	18	15	But if thi brother synneth ayens thee, go thou, and repreue hym, bitwixe thee and hym aloone; if he herith thee, thou hast wonnun thi brother.
23742	40	18	16	And if he herith thee not, take with thee oon or tweyne, that euery word stonde in the mouth of tweyne or thre witnessis.
23743	40	18	17	And if he herith not hem, seie thou to the chirche. But if he herith not the chirche, be he as an hethen and a pupplican to thee.
23744	40	18	18	Y seie to you treuli, what euer thingis ye bynden on erthe, tho schulen be boundun also in heuene; and what euer thingis ye vnbynden on erthe, tho schulen be vnboundun also in heuene.
23745	40	18	19	Eftsoone Y seie to you, that if tweyne of you consenten on the erthe, of euery thing what euer thei axen, it schal be don to hem of my fadir that is in heuenes.
23746	40	18	20	For where tweyne or thre ben gaderid in my name, there Y am in the myddil of hem.
23747	40	18	21	Thanne Petre cam to hym, and seide, Lord, how ofte schal my brother synne ayens me, and Y schal foryyue hym?
23748	40	18	22	Whether til seuen tymes? Jhesus seith to hym, Y seie not to thee, til seuene sithis; but til seuenti sithis seuene sithis.
23749	40	18	23	Therfor the kyngdom of heuenes is licned to a kyng, that wolde rekyn with hise seruauntis.
23750	40	18	24	And whanne he bigan to rekene, oon that ouyte ten thousynde talentis, was brouyt to hym.
23751	40	18	25	And whanne he hadde not wherof to yelde, his lord comaundide hym to be seld, and his wijf, and children, and alle thingis that he hadde, and to be paied.
23752	40	18	26	But thilke seruaunt felde doun, and preiede hym, and seide, Haue pacience in me, and Y schal yelde to thee alle thingis.
23753	40	18	27	And the lord hadde merci on that seruaunt, and suffride hym to go, and foryaf to hym the dette.
23754	40	18	28	But thilke seruaunt yede out, and foonde oon of his euen seruauntis, that ouyte hym an hundrid pens; and he helde hym, and stranglide hym, and seide, Yelde that that thou owest.
23755	40	18	29	And his euen seruaunt felle doun, and preyede hym, and seide, Haue pacience in me, and Y schal quyte alle thingis to thee.
23756	40	18	30	But he wolde not; but wente out, and putte hym in to prisoun, til he paiede al the dette.
23757	40	18	31	And hise euen seruauntis, seynge the thingis that weren don, soreweden greetli. And thei camen, and telden to her lord alle the thingis that weren don.
23758	40	18	32	Thanne his lord clepide hym, and seide to hym, Wickid seruaunt, Y foryaf to thee al the dette, for thou preiedist me.
23759	40	18	33	Therfor whether it bihouede not also thee to haue merci on thin euen seruaunt, as Y hadde merci on thee?
23760	40	18	34	And his lord was wroth, and took hym to turmentouris, til he paiede al the dette.
23761	40	18	35	So my fadir of heuene schal do to you, if ye foryyuen not euery man to his brother, of youre hertes.
23762	40	19	1	And it was don, whanne Jhesus hadde endid these wordis, he passide fro Galilee, and cam in to the coostis of Judee ouer Jordan.
23763	40	19	2	And myche puple suede him, and he heelide hem there.
23764	40	19	3	And Farisees camen to him, temptynge him, and seiden, Whether it be leueful to a man to leeue his wijf, for ony cause?
23765	40	19	4	Which answeride, and seide to hem, Han ye not red, for he that made men at the bigynnyng, made hem male and female?
23766	40	19	5	And he seide, For this thing a man schal leeue fadir and modir, and he schal draw to his wijf; and thei schulen be tweyne in o fleisch.
23767	40	19	6	And so thei ben not now tweyne, but o fleisch. Therfor a man departe not that thing that God hath ioyned.
23768	40	19	7	Thei seien to hym, What thanne comaundide Moises, to yyue a libel of forsakyng, and to leeue of?
23769	40	19	8	And he seide to hem, For Moises, for the hardnesse of youre herte, suffride you leeue youre wyues; but fro the bigynnyng it was not so.
23770	40	19	9	And Y seie to you, that who euer leeueth his wijf, but for fornycacioun, and weddith another, doith letcherie; and he that weddith the forsakun wijf, doith letcherie.
23771	40	19	10	His disciplis seien to him, If the cause of a man with a wijf is so, it spedith not to be weddid.
23772	40	19	11	And he seide to hem, Not alle men taken this word; but to whiche it is youun.
23773	40	19	12	For ther ben geldingis, whiche ben thus born of the modris wombe; and ther ben geldyngis, that ben maad of men; and there ben geldyngis, that han geldid hem silf, for the kyngdom of heuenes. He that may take, `take he.
23774	40	19	13	Thanne litle children weren brouyte to hym, that he schulde putte hondis to hem, and preie.
23775	40	19	14	And the disciplis blamyden hem. But Jhesus seide to hem, Suffre ye that litle children come to me, and nyle ye forbede hem; for of siche is the kyngdom of heuenes.
23776	40	19	15	And whanne he hadde put to hem hondis, he wente fro thennus.
23777	40	19	16	And lo! oon cam, and seide to hym, Good maister, what good schal Y do, that Y haue euerlastynge lijf?
23778	40	19	17	Which seith to hym, What axist thou me of good thing? There is o good God. But if thou wolt entre to lijf, kepe the comaundementis.
23779	40	19	18	He seith to hym, Whiche? And Jhesus seide, Thou schalt not do mansleying, thou schalt not do auowtrie, thou schalt not do thefte, thou schalt not seie fals witnessying;
23780	40	19	19	worschipe thi fadir and thi modir, and, thou schalt loue thi neiybore as thi silf.
23781	40	19	20	The yonge man seith to hym, Y haue kept alle these thingis fro my youthe, what yit failith to me?
23782	40	19	21	Jhesus seith to hym, If thou wolt be perfite, go, and sille alle thingis that thou hast, and yyue to pore men, and thou schalt haue tresoure in heuene; and come, and sue me.
23783	40	19	22	And whanne the yong man hadde herd these wordis, he wente awei sorewful, for he hadde many possessiouns.
23784	40	19	23	And Jhesus seide to hise disciplis, Y seie to you treuthe, for a riche man of hard schal entre in to the kyngdom of heuenes.
23785	40	19	24	And eftsoone Y seie to you, it is liyter a camel to passe thorou a needlis iye, thanne a riche man to entre in to the kyngdom of heuens.
23786	40	19	25	Whanne these thingis weren herd, the disciplis wondriden greetli, and seiden, Who thanne may be saaf?
23787	40	19	26	Jhesus bihelde, and seide to hem, Anentis men this thing is impossible; but anentis God alle thingis ben possible.
23788	40	19	27	Thanne Petre answeride, and seide to hym, Lo! we han forsake alle thingis, and we han suede thee; what thanne schal be to vs?
23789	40	19	28	Jhesus seide to hem, Truli I seie to you, that ye that han forsake alle thingis, and han sued me, in the regeneracioun whanne mannus sone schal sitte in the sete of his maieste, ye schulen sitte on twelue setis, demynge the twelue kynredis of Israel.
23790	40	19	29	And euery man that forsakith hous, britheren or sistren, fadir or modir, wijf ethir children, or feeldis, for my name, he schal take an hundrid foold, and schal welde euerlastynge lijf.
23791	40	19	30	But manye schulen be, the firste the laste, and the laste the firste.
23792	40	20	1	The kyngdom of heuenes is lijc to an housbonde man, that wente out first bi the morewe, to hire werk men in to his vyneyerd.
23793	40	20	2	And whanne the couenaunt was maad with werk men, of a peny for the dai, he sente hem in to his vyneyerd.
23794	40	20	3	And he yede out aboute the thridde our, and say othere stondynge idel in the chepyng.
23795	40	20	4	And he seide to hem, Go ye also in to myn vynyerd, and that that schal be riytful, Y schal yyue to you.
23796	40	20	5	And thei wenten forth. Eftsoones he wente out aboute the sixte our, and the nynthe, and dide in lijk maner.
23797	40	20	6	But aboute the elleuenthe our he wente out, and foond other stondynge; and he seide to hem, What stonden ye idel here al dai?
23798	40	20	7	Thei seien to him, For no man hath hirid vs. He seith to hem, Go ye also in to my vyneyerd.
23799	40	20	8	And whanne euenyng was comun, the lord of the vyneyerd seith to his procuratoure, Clepe the werk men, and yelde to hem her hire, and bigynne thou at the laste til to the firste.
23800	40	20	9	And so whanne thei weren comun, that camen aboute the elleuenthe our, also thei token eueryche of hem a peny.
23801	40	20	10	But the firste camen, and demeden, that thei schulden take more, but thei token ech oon bi hem silf a peny;
23802	40	20	11	and in the takyng grutchiden ayens the hosebonde man, and seiden,
23803	40	20	12	These laste wrouyten oon our, and thou hast maad hem euen to vs, that han born the charge of the dai, and heete?
23804	40	20	13	And he answeride to oon of hem, and seide, Freend, Y do thee noon wrong; whether thou hast not acordid with me for a peny?
23805	40	20	14	Take thou that that is thin, and go; for Y wole yyue to this laste man, as to thee.
23806	40	20	15	Whether it is not leueful to me to do that that Y wole? Whether thin iye is wickid, for Y am good?
23807	40	20	16	So the laste schulen be the firste, and the firste the laste; `for many ben clepid, but fewe ben chosun.
23808	40	20	17	And Jhesus wente vp to Jerusalem, and took hise twelue disciplis in priuetee, and seide to hem, Lo!
23809	40	20	18	we goon vp to Jerusalem, and mannus sone schal be bitakun to princis of prestis, and scribis; and thei schulen condempne him to deeth.
23810	40	20	19	And thei schulen bitake hym to hethene men, for to be scorned, and scourgid, and crucified; and the thridde day he schal rise ayen to lijf.
23811	40	20	20	Thanne the modir of the sones of Zebedee cam to hym with hir sones, onourynge, and axynge sum thing of hym.
23812	40	20	21	And he seide to hir, What wolt thou? She seith to hym, Seie that thes tweyne my sones sitte, oon at thi riythalf, and oon at thi lefthalf, in thi kyngdom.
23813	40	20	22	Jhesus answeride, and seide, Ye witen not what ye axen. Moun ye drynke the cuppe which Y schal drynke? Thei seien to hym, We moun.
23814	40	20	23	He seith to hem, Ye schulen drinke my cuppe; but to sitte at my riythalf or lefthalf, it is not myn to yyue to you; but to whiche it is maad redi of my fadir.
23815	40	20	24	And the ten herynge, hadden indignacioun of the twei britheren.
23816	40	20	25	But Jhesus clepide hem to hym, and seide, Ye witen, that princis of hethene men ben lordis of hem, and thei that ben gretter, vsen power on hem.
23817	40	20	26	It schal not be so among you; but who euer wole be maad gretter among you, be he youre mynystre; and who euer among you wole be the firste, he schal be youre seruaunt.
23818	40	20	28	As mannus sone cam not to be seruyd, but to serue, and to yyue his lijf redempcioun for manye.
23819	40	20	29	And whanne thei yeden out of Jerico, miche puple suede him.
23820	40	20	30	And lo! twei blynde men saten bisydis the weie, and herden that Jhesus passide; and thei crieden, and seiden, Lord, the sone of Dauid, haue merci on vs.
23821	40	20	31	And the puple blamede hem, that thei schulden be stille; and thei crieden the more, and seiden, Lord, the sone of Dauid, haue merci on vs.
23822	40	20	32	And Jhesus stood, and clepide hem, and seide, What wolen ye, that Y do to you?
23823	40	20	33	Thei seien to him, Lord, that oure iyen be opened.
23824	40	20	34	And Jhesus hadde merci on hem, and touchide her iyen; and anoon thei sayen, and sueden him.
23825	40	21	1	And whanne Jhesus cam nyy to Jerusalem, and cam to Bethfage, at the mount of Olyuete, thanne sente he his twei disciplis, and seide to hem,
23826	40	21	2	Go ye in to the castel that is ayens you, and anoon ye schulen fynde an asse tied, and a colt with hir; vntien ye, and brynge to me.
23827	40	21	3	And if ony man seie to you ony thing, seie ye, that the Lord hath nede to hem; and anoon he schal leeue hem.
23828	40	21	4	Al this was doon, that that thing schulde be fulfillid, that was seid bi the prophete, seiynge, Seie ye to the douyter of Syon, Lo!
23829	40	21	5	thi kyng cometh to thee, meke, sittynge on an asse, and a fole of an asse vnder yok.
23830	40	21	6	And the disciplis yeden, and diden as Jhesus comaundide hem.
23831	40	21	7	And thei brouyten an asse, and the fole, and leiden her clothis on hem, and maden hym sitte aboue.
23832	40	21	8	And ful myche puple strewiden her clothis in the weie; othere kittiden braunchis of trees, and strewiden in the weie.
23833	40	21	9	And the puple that wente bifore, and that sueden, crieden, and seiden, Osanna to the sone of Dauid; blessid is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Osanna in hiy thingis.
23834	40	21	10	And whanne he was entrid in to Jerusalem, al the citee was stirid, and seide, Who is this?
23835	40	21	11	But the puple seide, This is Jhesus, the prophete, of Nazareth of Galilee.
23836	40	21	12	And Jhesus entride in to the temple of God, and castide out of the temple alle that bouyten and solden; and he turnede vpsedoun the bordis of chaungeris, and the chayeris of men that solden culueris.
23837	40	21	13	And he seith to hem, It is writun, Myn hous schal be clepid an hous of preier; but ye han maad it a denne of theues.
23838	40	21	14	And blynde and crokid camen to hym in the temple, and he heelide hem.
23839	40	21	15	But the princis of prestis and scribis, seynge the merueilouse thingis that he dide, and children criynge in the temple, and seiynge, Osanna to the sone of Dauid, hadden indignacioun,
23840	40	21	16	and seiden to hym, Herist thou what these seien? And Jhesus seide to hem, Yhe; whether ye han neuer redde, That of the mouth of yonge children, and of soukynge childryn, thou hast maad perfit heriyng?
23841	40	21	17	And whanne he hadde left hem, he wente forth out of the citee, in to Bethanye; and there he dwelte, and tauyte hem of the kyngdom of God.
23842	40	21	18	But on the morowe, he, turnynge ayen in to the citee, hungride.
23843	40	21	19	And he saye a fige tree bisidis the weie, and cam to it, and foond no thing ther ynne but leeues oneli. And he seide to it, Neuer fruyt come forth of thee, in to with outen eende, And anoon the fige tre was dried vp.
23844	40	21	20	And disciplis `sawen, and wondriden, seiynge, Hou anoon it driede.
23845	40	21	21	And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hem, Treuli Y seie to you, if ye haue feith, and douten not, not oonli ye schulen do of the fige tree, but also if ye seyn to this hil, Take, and caste thee in to the see, it schal be don so.
23846	40	21	22	And alle thingis what euere ye bileuynge schulen axe in preyer, ye schulen take.
23847	40	21	23	And whanne he cam in to the temple, the princis of prestis and elder men of the puple camen to hym that tauyte, and seiden, In what power doist thou these thingis? and who yaf thee this power?
23848	40	21	24	Jhesus answeride, and seide to hem, And Y schal axe you o word, the which if ye tellen me, Y schal seie to you, in what power Y do these thingis.
23849	40	21	25	Of whennys was the baptym of Joon; of heuene, or of men? And thei thouyten with ynne hem silf,
23850	40	21	26	seiynge, If we seien of heuene, he schal seie to vs, Whi thanne bileuen ye not to hym? If we seien of men, we dreden the puple, for alle hadden Joon as a prophete.
23851	40	21	27	And thei answeriden to Jhesu, and seiden, We witen not. And he seide to hem, Nether Y seie to you, in what power Y do these thingis.
23852	40	21	28	But what semeth to you? A man hadde twey sones; and he cam to the firste, and seide, Sone, go worche this dai in my vyneyerd.
23853	40	21	29	And he answeride, and seide, Y nyle; but afterward he forthouyte, and wente forth.
23854	40	21	30	But he cam to `the tother, and seide on lijk maner. And he answeride, and seide, Lord, Y go; and he wente not.
23855	40	21	31	Who of the tweyne dide the fadris wille? Thei seien to hym, The firste. Jhesus seith to hem, Treuli Y seie to you, for pupplicans and hooris schulen go bifor you `in to the kyngdom of God.
23856	40	21	32	For Joon cam to you in the weie of riytwisnesse, and ye bileueden not to him; but pupplicans and hooris bileueden to hym. But ye sayn, and hadden no forthenkyng aftir, that ye bileueden to hym.
23857	40	21	33	Here ye another parable. There was an hosebonde man, that plauntide a vynyerd, and heggide it aboute, and dalfe a presour ther ynne, and bildide a tour, and hiride it to erthe tilieris, and wente fer in pilgrimage.
23858	40	21	34	But whanne the tyme of fruytis neiyede, he sente his seruauntis to the erthe tilieris, to take fruytis of it.
23859	40	21	35	And the erthetilieris token his seruauntis, and beeten `the toon, thei slowen another, and thei stonyden another.
23860	40	21	36	Eftsoone he sente othere seruauntis, mo than the firste, and in lijk maner thei diden to hem.
23861	40	21	37	And at the laste he sente his sone to hem, and seide, Thei schulen drede my sone.
23862	40	21	38	But the erthe tilieris, seynge the sone, seiden with ynne hem silf, This is the eire; come ye, sle we hym, and we schulen haue his eritage.
23863	40	21	39	And thei token, and castiden hym out of the vynyerd, and slowen hym.
23864	40	21	40	Therfor whanne the lord of the vyneyerd schal come, what schal he do to thilke erthe tilieris?
23865	40	21	41	Thei seien to hym, He schal leese yuele the yuele men, and he schal sette to hire his vyneyerd to othere erthetilieris, whyche schulen yelde to hym fruyt in her tymes.
23866	40	21	42	Jhesus seith to hem, Redden ye neuer in scripturis, The stoon which bilderis repreueden, this is maad in to the heed of the corner? Of the Lord this thing is don, and it is merueilous bifor oure iyen.
23867	40	21	43	Therfor Y seie to you, that the kyngdom of God schal be takun fro you, and shal be youun to a folc doynge fruytis of it.
23868	40	21	44	And he that schal falle on this stoon, schal be brokun; but on whom it schal falle, it schal al tobrise hym.
23869	40	21	45	And whanne the princes of prestis and Farisees hadden herd hise parablis, thei knewen that he seide of hem.
23870	40	21	46	And thei souyten to holde hym, but thei dredden the puple, for thei hadden hym as a prophete.
23871	40	22	1	And Jhesus answeride, and spak eftsoone in parablis to hem,
23872	40	22	2	and seide, The kyngdom of heuenes is maad lijk to a kyng that made weddyngis to his sone.
23873	40	22	3	And he sente hise seruauntis for to clepe men that weren bode to the weddyngis, and thei wolden not come.
23874	40	22	4	Eftsoone he sente othere seruauntis, and seide, Seie ye to the men that ben bode to the feeste, Lo! Y haue maad redi my meete, my bolis and my volatilis ben slayn, and alle thingis ben redy; come ye to the weddyngis.
23875	40	22	5	But thei dispisiden, and wenten forth, oon in to his toun, anothir to his marchaundise. But othere helden his seruauntis, and turmentiden hem, and slowen.
23876	40	22	7	But the kyng, whanne he hadde herd, was wroth; and he sente hise oostis, and he distruyede tho manquelleris, and brente her citee.
23877	40	22	8	Thanne he seide to hise seruauntis, The weddyngis ben redi, but thei that weren clepid to the feeste, weren not worthi.
23878	40	22	9	Therfor go ye to the endis of weies, and whom euere ye fynden, clepe ye to the weddyngis.
23879	40	22	10	And hise seruauntis yeden out in to weies, and gadriden togider alle that thei founden, good and yuele; and the bridale was fulfillid with men sittynge at the mete.
23880	40	22	11	And the kyng entride, to se men sittynge at the mete; and he siye there a man not clothid with bride cloth.
23881	40	22	12	And he seide to hym, Freend, hou entridist thou hidir with out bride clothis? And he was doumbe.
23882	40	22	13	Thanne the kyng bad hise mynystris, Bynde hym bothe hondis and feet, and sende ye him in to vtmer derknessis; there schal be wepyng and grentyng of teeth.
23883	40	22	14	For many ben clepid, but fewe ben chosun.
23884	40	22	15	Thanne Farisees yeden awei, and token a counsel to take Jhesu in word.
23885	40	22	16	And thei senden to hym her disciplis, with Erodians, and seien, Maister, we witen, that thou art sothefast, and thou techist in treuthe the weie of God, and thou chargist not of ony man, for thou biholdist not the persoone of men.
23886	40	22	17	Therfor seie to vs, what it seemeth to thee. Is it leueful that tribute be youun to the emperoure, ether nay?
23887	40	22	18	And whanne Jhesus hadde knowe the wickidnesse of hem, he seide, Ypocritis, what tempten ye me?
23888	40	22	19	Schewe ye to me the prynte of the money. And thei brouyten to hym a peny.
23889	40	22	20	And Jhesus seide to hem, Whos is this ymage, and the writyng aboue?
23890	40	22	21	Thei seien to hym, The emperouris. Thanne he seide to hem, Therfor yelde ye to the emperoure tho thingis that ben the emperouris, and to God tho thingis that ben of God.
23891	40	22	22	And thei herden, and wondriden; and thei leften hym, and wenten awey.
23892	40	22	23	In that dai Saduceis, that seien there is no risyng ayen to lijf, camen to hym, and axiden him,
23893	40	22	24	and seiden, Mayster, Moises seide, if ony man is deed, not hauynge a sone, that his brother wedde his wijf, and reise seed to his brothir.
23894	40	22	25	And seuen britheren weren at vs; and the firste weddide a wijf, and is deed. And he hadde no seed, and lefte his wijf to his brother;
23895	40	22	26	also the secounde, and the thridde, til to the seuenthe.
23896	40	22	27	But the laste of alle, the woman is deed.
23897	40	22	28	Also in the risyng ayen to lijf, whos wijf of the seuene schal sche be? for alle hadden hir.
23898	40	22	29	Jhesus answeride, and seide to hem, Ye erren, `and ye knowen not scripturis, ne the vertu of God.
23899	40	22	30	For in the rysyng ayen to lijf, nether thei schulen wedde, nethir schulen be weddid; but thei ben as the aungels of God in heuene.
23900	40	22	31	And of the risyng ayen of deed men, `han ye not red, that is seid of the Lord, that seith to you,
23901	40	22	32	Y am God of Abraham, and God of Ysaac, and God of Jacob? he is not God of deede men, but of lyuynge men.
23902	40	22	33	And the puple herynge, wondriden in his techynge.
23903	40	22	34	And Fariseis herden that he hadde put silence to Saduceis, and camen togidere.
23904	40	22	35	And oon of hem, a techere of the lawe, axide Jhesu, and temptide him,
23905	40	22	36	Maistir, which is a greet maundement in the lawe?
23906	40	22	37	Jhesus seide to him, Thou schalt loue thi Lord God, of al thin herte, and in al thi soule, and in al thi mynde.
23907	40	22	38	This is the firste and the moste maundement.
23908	40	22	39	And the secounde is lijk to this; Thou schalt loue thi neiyebore as thi silf.
23909	40	22	40	In these twey maundementis hangith al the lawe and the profetis.
23910	40	22	41	And whanne the Farisees weren gederid togidere, Jhesus axide hem,
23911	40	22	42	and seide, What semeth to you of Crist, whos sone is he? Thei seien to hym, Of Dauid.
23912	40	22	43	He seith to hem, Hou thanne Dauid in spirit clepith hym Lord,
23913	40	22	44	and seith, The Lord seide to my Lord, Sitte on my riythalf, til Y putte thin enemyes a stool of thi feet?
23914	40	22	45	Thanne if Dauid clepith hym Lord, hou is he his sone?
23915	40	22	46	And no man miyte answere a word to hym, nethir ony man was hardi fro that day, to axe hym more.
23916	40	23	1	Thanne Jhesus spac to the puple, and to hise disciplis,
23917	40	23	2	and seide, On the chayere of Moises, scribis and Farisees han sete.
23918	40	23	3	Therfor kepe ye, and do ye alle thingis, what euer thingis thei seien to you. But nyle ye do aftir her werkis; for thei seien, and don not.
23919	40	23	4	And thei bynden greuouse chargis, and that moun not be borun, and putten on schuldris of men; but with her fyngur thei wolen not moue hem.
23920	40	23	5	Therfor thei don alle her werkis `that thei be seen of men; for thei drawen abrood her filateries, and magnifien hemmes.
23921	40	23	6	And thei louen the first sittyng placis in soperis, and the first chaieris in synagogis;
23922	40	23	7	and salutaciouns in chepyng, and to be clepid of men maystir.
23923	40	23	8	But nyle ye be clepid maister; for oon is youre maystir, and alle ye ben britheren.
23924	40	23	9	And nyle ye clepe to you a fadir on erthe, for oon is your fadir, that is in heuenes.
23925	40	23	10	Nether be ye clepid maistris, for oon is youre maister, Crist.
23926	40	23	11	He that is grettest among you, schal be youre mynystre.
23927	40	23	12	For he that hieth himself, schal be mekid; and he that mekith hym silf, schal be enhaunsid.
23928	40	23	13	But wo to you, scribis and Farisees, ipocritis, that closen the kyngdom of heuenes bifore men; and ye entren not, nether suffren men entrynge to entre.
23929	40	23	14	Wo to you, scribis and Farisees, ipocritis, that eten the housis of widowis, and preien bi longe preier; for this thing ye schulen take more doom.
23930	40	23	15	Wo to you, scribis and Farisees, ypocritis, that goon aboute the see and the loond, to make o prosilite; and whanne he is maad, ye maken hym a sone of helle, double more than ye ben.
23931	40	23	16	Wo to you, blynde lederis, that seien, Who euer swerith bi the temple of God, it is `no thing; but he that swerith in the gold of the temple, is dettoure.
23932	40	23	17	Ye foolis and blynde, for what is grettere, the gold, or the temple that halewith the gold?
23933	40	23	18	And who euer swerith in the auter, it is no thing; but he that swerith in the yifte that is on the auter, owith.
23934	40	23	19	Blynde men, for what is more, the yifte, or the auter that halewith the yifte?
23935	40	23	20	Therfor he that swerith in the auter, swerith in it, and in alle thingis that ben ther on.
23936	40	23	21	And he that swerith in the temple, swerith in it, and in hym that dwellith in the temple.
23937	40	23	22	And he that swerith in heuene, swerith in the trone of God, and in hym that sittith ther on.
23938	40	23	23	Wo to you, scribis and Farisees, ypocritis, that tithen mynte, anete, and cummyn, and han left tho thingis that ben of more charge of the lawe, doom, and merci, and feith. And it bihofte to do these thingis, and not to leeue tho.
23939	40	23	24	Blynde lederis, clensinge a gnatte, but swolewynge a camel.
23940	40	23	25	Woo to you, scribis and Farisees, ypocritis, that clensen the cuppe and the plater with outforth; but with ynne ye ben ful of raueyne and vnclennesse.
23941	40	23	26	Thou blynde Farisee, clense the cuppe and the plater with ynneforth, that that that is with outforth be maad clene.
23942	40	23	27	Wo to you, scribis and Farisees, ipocritis, that ben lijk to sepulcris whitid, whiche with outforth semen faire to men; but with ynne thei ben fulle of boonus of deed men, and of al filthe.
23943	40	23	28	So ye with outforth semen iust to men; but with ynne ye ben ful of ypocrisy and wickidnesse.
23944	40	23	29	Wo to you, scribis and Farisees, ipocritis, that bilden sepulcris of profetis, and maken faire the birielis of iust men,
23945	40	23	30	and seien, If we hadden be in the daies of oure fadris, we schulden not haue be her felowis in the blood of prophetis.
23946	40	23	31	And so ye ben in witnessyng to you silf, that ye ben the sones of hem that slowen the prophetis.
23947	40	23	32	And fulfille ye the mesure of youre fadris.
23948	40	23	33	Ye eddris, and eddris briddis, hou schulen ye fle fro the doom of helle?
23949	40	23	34	Therfor lo! Y sende to you profetis, and wise men, and scribis; and of hem ye schulen sle and crucifie, and of hem ye schulen scourge in youre sinagogis, and schulen pursue fro cite in to citee;
23950	40	23	35	that al the iust blood come on you, that was sched on the erthe, fro the blood of iust Abel to the blood of Zacarie, the sone of Barachie, whom ye slowen bitwixe the temple and the auter.
23951	40	23	36	Treuli Y seie to you, alle these thingis schulen come on this generacioun.
23952	40	23	37	Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that sleest prophetis, and stoonest hem that ben sent to thee, hou ofte wolde Y gadere togidere thi children, as an henne gaderith togidir her chikenes vndir hir wengis, and thou woldist not.
23953	40	23	38	Lo! youre hous schal be left to you desert.
23954	40	23	39	And Y seie to you, ye schulen not se me fro hennus forth, til ye seien, Blessid is he, that cometh in the name of the Lord.
23955	40	24	1	And Jhesus wente out of the temple; and his disciplis camen to hym, to schewe hym the bildyngis of the temple.
23956	40	24	2	But he answeride, and seide to hem, Seen ye alle these thingis? Treuli Y seie to you, a stoon schal not be left here on a stoon, that ne it schal be destried.
23957	40	24	3	And whanne he satte on the hille of Olyuete, hise disciplis camen to hym priueli, and seiden, Seie vs, whanne these thingis schulen be, and what token of thi comyng, and of the ending of the world.
23958	40	24	4	And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hem, Loke ye, that no man disseyue you.
23959	40	24	5	For many schulen come in my name, and schulen seie, Y am Crist; and thei schulen disseyue manye.
23960	40	24	6	For ye schulen here batels, and opyniouns of batels; se ye that ye be not disturblid; for it byhoueth these thingis to be don, but not yit is the ende.
23961	40	24	7	Folk schal rise togidere ayens folc, and rewme ayens rewme, and pestilences, and hungris, and the erthemouyngis schulen be bi placis;
23962	40	24	8	and alle these ben bigynnyngis of sorewes.
23963	40	24	9	Thanne men schulen bitake you in to tribulacion, and schulen sle you, and ye schulen be in hate to alle folk for my name.
23964	40	24	10	And thanne many schulen be sclaundrid, and bitraye ech other, and thei schulen hate ech other.
23965	40	24	11	And many false prophetis schulen rise, and disseyue manye.
23966	40	24	12	And for wickidnesse schal `be plenteuouse, the charite of manye schal wexe coold;
23967	40	24	13	but he that schal dwelle stable in to the ende, schal be saaf.
23968	40	24	14	And this gospel of the kyngdom schal be prechid in al the world, in witnessyng to al folc;
23969	40	24	15	and thanne the ende schal come. Therfor whanne ye se the abhomynacioun of discomfort, that is seid of Danyel, the prophete, stondynge in the hooli place; he that redith, vndirstonde he;
23970	40	24	16	thanne thei that ben in Judee, fle to the mounteyns; and he that is in the hous roof,
23971	40	24	17	come not doun to take ony thing of his hous; and he that is in the feeld,
23972	40	24	18	turne not ayen to take his coote.
23973	40	24	19	But wo to hem that ben with child, and nurischen in tho daies.
23974	40	24	20	Preye ye, that youre fleyng be not maad in wynter, or in the saboth.
23975	40	24	21	For thanne schal be greet tribulacioun, what maner `was not fro the bigynnyng of the world to now, nether schal be maad.
23976	40	24	22	And but tho daies hadden be abreggide, ech flesch schulde not be maad saaf; but tho daies schulen be maad schort, for the chosun men.
23977	40	24	23	Thanne if ony man seie to you, Lo! here is Crist, or there, nyle ye bileue.
23978	40	24	24	For false Cristis and false prophetis schulen rise, and thei schulen yyue grete tokenes and wondrys; so that also the chosun be led in to erroure, if it may be done.
23979	40	24	25	Lo! Y haue bifor seid to you.
23980	40	24	26	Therfor if thei seie to you, Lo! he is in desert, nyle ye go out; lo! in priuey placis, nyle ye trowe.
23981	40	24	27	For as leit goith out fro the eest, and apperith in to the weste, so schal be also the coming of mannus sone.
23982	40	24	28	Where euer the bodi schal be, also the eglis schulen be gaderid thidur.
23983	40	24	29	And anoon after the tribulacioun of tho daies, the sunne schal be maad derk, and the moone schal not yyue hir liyt, and the sterris schulen falle fro heuene, and the vertues of heuenes schulen be moued.
23984	40	24	30	And thanne the tokene of mannus sone schal appere in heuene, and thanne alle kynredis of the erthe schulen weile; and thei schulen see mannus sone comynge in the cloudis of heuene, with miche vertu and maieste.
23985	40	24	31	And he schal sende hise aungels with a trumpe, and a greet vois; and thei schulen gedere hise chosun fro foure wyndis, fro the hiyest thingis of heuenes to the endis of hem.
23986	40	24	32	And lerne ye the parable of a fige tre. Whanne his braunche is now tendir, and the leeues ben sprongun, ye witen that somer is nyy;
23987	40	24	33	`so and ye whanne ye seen alle these thingis, wite ye that it is nyy, in the yatis.
23988	40	24	34	Treuli Y seie to you, for this generacioun schal not passe, til alle thingis be don;
23989	40	24	35	heuene and erthe schulen passe, but my wordis schulen not passe.
23990	40	24	36	But of thilke dai and our no man wote, nethir aungels of heuenes, but the fadir aloone.
23991	40	24	37	But as it was in the daies of Noe, so schal be the comyng of mannus sone.
23992	40	24	38	For as in the daies bifore the greet flood, thei weren etynge and drynkynge, weddynge and takynge to weddyng, to that dai, that Noe entride in to the schippe;
23993	40	24	39	and thei knewen not, til the greet flood cam, and took alle men, so schal be the comyng of mannus sone.
23994	40	24	40	Thanne tweyne schulen be in o feeld, oon schal be takun, and another left;
23995	40	24	41	twey wymmen schulen be gryndynge in o queerne, oon schal be takun, and `the tother left; tweyn in a bedde, `the toon schal be takun, and the tother left.
23996	40	24	42	Therfor wake ye, for ye witen not in what our the Lord schal come.
23997	40	24	43	But wite ye this, that if the hosebonde man wiste in what our the thefe were to come, certis he wolde wake, and suffre not his hous to be vndurmyned.
23998	40	24	44	And therfor be ye redi, for in what our ye gessen not, mannus sone schal come.
23999	40	24	45	Who gessist thou is a trewe seruaunt and prudent, whom his lord ordeyned on his meynee, to yyue hem mete in tyme?
24000	40	24	46	Blessed is that seruaunt, whom `his lord, whanne he schal come, schal fynde so doynge.
24001	40	24	47	Treuli Y seye to you, for on alle his goodis he schal ordeyne hym.
24002	40	24	48	But if thilke yuel seruaunt seie in his herte, My lord tarieth to come,
24003	40	24	49	and bigynneth to smyte hise euen seruauntis, and ete, and drynke with drunken men;
24004	40	24	50	the lord of that seruaunt schal come in the dai which he hopith not, and in the our that he knowith not,
24005	40	24	50	and schal departe hym, and putte his part with ypocritis; there schal be wepyng, and gryntyng of teeth.
24006	40	25	1	Thanne the kyngdoom of heuenes schal be lijk to ten virgyns, whiche token her laumpis, and wenten out ayens the hosebonde and the wijf;
24007	40	25	2	and fyue of hem weren foolis, and fyue prudent.
24008	40	25	3	But the fyue foolis token her laumpis, and token not oile with hem;
24009	40	25	4	but the prudent token oile in her vessels with the laumpis.
24010	40	25	5	And whilis the hosebonde tariede, alle thei nappiden and slepten.
24011	40	25	6	But at mydnyyt a cryy was maad, Lo! the spouse cometh, go ye oute to mete with him.
24012	40	25	7	Thanne alle tho virgyns risen vp, and araieden her laumpis.
24013	40	25	8	And the foolis seiden to the wise, Yyue ye to vs of youre oile, for oure laumpis ben quenchid.
24014	40	25	9	The prudent answeriden, and seiden, Lest perauenture it suffice not to vs and to you, go ye rather to men that sellen, and bie to you.
24015	40	25	10	And while thei wenten for to bie, the spouse cam; and tho that weren redi, entreden with him to the weddyngis; and the yate was schit.
24016	40	25	11	And at the last the othere virgyns camen, and seiden, Lord, lord, opene to vs.
24017	40	25	12	And he answeride, and seide, Treuli Y seie to you, Y knowe you not.
24018	40	25	13	Therfor wake ye, for ye witen not the dai ne the our.
24019	40	25	14	For as a man that goith in pilgrimage, clepide hise seruauntis, and bitook to hem hise goodis;
24020	40	25	15	and to oon he yaf fyue talentis, and to another tweyne, and to another oon, to ech after his owne vertu; and wente forth anoon.
24021	40	25	16	And he that hadde fyue besauntis, wente forth, and wrouyte in hem, and wan othere fyue.
24022	40	25	17	Also and he that hadde takun tweyne, wan othere tweyne.
24023	40	25	18	But he that hadde takun oon, yede forth, and dalf in to the erthe, and hidde the money of his lord.
24024	40	25	19	But after long tyme, the lord of tho seruauntis cam, and rekenede with hem.
24025	40	25	20	And he that hadde takun fyue besauntis, cam, and brouyte othere fyue, and seide, Lord, thou bytokist to me fyue besauntis, loo! Y haue getun aboue fyue othere.
24026	40	25	21	His lord seide to hym, Wel be thou, good seruaunt and feithful; for on fewe thingis thou hast be trewe, Y schal ordeyne thee on manye thingis; entre thou in to the ioye of thi lord.
24027	40	25	22	And he that hadde takun twey talentis, cam, and seide, Lord, thou bitokist to me twey besauntis; loo!
24028	40	25	23	Y haue wonnen ouer othir tweyne. His lord seide to him, Wel be thou, good seruaunt and trewe; for on fewe thingis thou hast be trewe, Y schal ordeyne thee on many thingis; entre thou in to the ioie of thi lord.
24029	40	25	24	But he that hadde takun o besaunt, cam, and seide, Lord, Y woot that thou art an hard man; thou repist where thou hast not sowe, and thou gederist togidere where thou hast not spred abrood;
24030	40	25	25	and Y dredynge wente, and hidde thi besaunt in the erthe; lo! thou hast that that is thin.
24031	40	25	26	His lord answeride, and seide to hym, Yuel seruaunt and slowe, wistist thou that Y repe where Y sewe not, and gadir to gidere where Y spredde not abrood?
24032	40	25	27	Therfor it bihofte thee to bitake my money to chaungeris, that whanne Y cam, Y schulde resseyue that that is myn with vsuris.
24033	40	25	28	Therfor take awei fro hym the besaunt, and yyue ye to hym that hath ten besauntis.
24034	40	25	29	For to euery man that hath me schal yyue, and he schal encreese; but fro hym that hath not, also that that hym semeth to haue, schal be taken awey fro him.
24035	40	25	30	And caste ye out the vnprofitable seruaunt in to vtmer derknessis; ther schal be wepyng, and gryntyng of teeth.
24036	40	25	31	Whanne mannus sone schal come in his maieste, and alle hise aungels with hym, thanne he schal sitte on the sege of his maieste;
24037	40	25	32	and alle folkis schulen be gaderid bifor hym,
24038	40	25	33	and he schal departe hem atwynne, as a scheeperde departith scheep from kidis; and he schal sette the scheep on his riythalf, and the kidis on the lefthalf.
24039	40	25	34	Thanne the kyng schal seie to hem, that schulen be on his riythalf, Come ye, the blessid of my fadir, take ye in possessioun the kyngdoom maad redi to you fro the makyng of the world.
24040	40	25	35	For Y hungride, and ye yauen me to ete; Y thristide, and ye yauen me to drynke; Y was herboreles, and ye herboriden me;
24041	40	25	36	nakid, and ye hiliden me; sijk, and ye visitiden me; Y was in prisoun, and ye camen to me.
24042	40	25	37	Thanne iust men schulen answere to hym, and seie, Lord, whanne siyen we thee hungry, and we fedden thee; thristi, and we yauen to thee drynk?
24043	40	25	38	and whanne sayn we thee herborles, and we herboreden thee; or nakid, and we hiliden thee?
24044	40	25	39	or whanne sayn we thee sijk, or in prisoun, and we camen to thee?
24045	40	25	40	And the kyng answerynge schal seie to hem, Treuli Y seie to you, as longe as ye diden to oon of these my leeste britheren, ye diden to me.
24046	40	25	41	Thanne the kyng schal seie also to hem, that schulen be on his lefthalf, Departe fro me, ye cursid, in to euerlastynge fijr, that is maad redi to the deuel and hise aungels.
24047	40	25	42	For Y hungride, and ye yauen not me to ete; Y thristide, and ye yauen not me to drynke;
24048	40	25	43	Y was herborles, and ye herberden not me; nakid, and ye keuerden not me; sijk, and in prisoun, and ye visitiden not me.
24049	40	25	44	Thanne and thei schulen answere to hym, and schulen seie, Lord, whanne sayn we thee hungrynge, or thristynge, or herboreles, or nakid, or sijk, or in prisoun, and we serueden not to thee?
24050	40	25	45	Thanne he schal answere to hem, and seie, Treuli Y seie to you, `hou longe ye diden not to oon of these leeste, nether ye diden to me.
24051	40	25	46	And these schulen goo in to euerlastynge turment; but the iust men schulen go in to euerlastynge lijf.
24052	40	26	1	And it was doon, whanne Jhesus hadde endid alle these wordis, he seide to hise disciplis,
24053	40	26	2	Ye witen, that aftir twei daies pask schal be maad, and mannus sone schal be bitakun to be crucified.
24054	40	26	3	Than the princes of prestis and the elder men of the puple were gaderid in to the halle of the prince of prestis, that was seid Cayfas,
24055	40	26	4	and maden a counsel to holde Jhesu with gile, and sle him;
24056	40	26	5	but thei seiden, Not in the haliday, lest perauenture noyse were maad in the puple.
24057	40	26	6	And whanne Jhesus was in Betanye, in the hous of Symount leprous,
24058	40	26	7	a womman that hadde a box of alabastre of precious oynement, cam to hym, and schedde out on the heed of hym restynge.
24059	40	26	8	And disciplis seynge hadden dedeyn, and seiden, Wherto this loss? for it myyte be seld for myche,
24060	40	26	9	and be youun to pore men.
24061	40	26	10	But Jhesus knewe, and seide to hem, What ben ye heuy to this womman? for sche hath wrouyt in me a good werk.
24062	40	26	11	For ye schulen euere haue pore men with you, but ye schulen not algatis haue me.
24063	40	26	12	This womman sendynge this oynement in to my bodi, dide to birie me.
24064	40	26	13	Treuli Y seie to you, where euer this gospel schal be prechid in al the world, it schal be seid, that sche dide this, in mynde of hym.
24065	40	26	14	Thanne oon of the twelue, that was clepid Judas Scarioth, wente forth to the princis of prestis,
24066	40	26	15	and seide to hem, What wolen ye yyue to me, and Y schal bitake hym to you? And thei ordeyneden to hym thretti pans of siluer.
24067	40	26	16	And fro that tyme he souyte oportunyte, to bitraye hym.
24068	40	26	17	And in the firste dai of therf looues the disciplis camen to Jhesu, and seiden, Where wolt thou we make redi to thee, to ete paske?
24069	40	26	18	Jhesus seide, Go ye into the citee to `sum man, and seie to hym, The maistir seith, My tyme is nyy; at thee Y make paske with my disciplis.
24070	40	26	19	And the disciplis diden, as Jhesus comaundide to hem; and thei maden the paske redi.
24071	40	26	20	And whanne euentid was come, he sat to mete with hise twelue disciplis.
24072	40	26	21	And he seide to hem, as thei eten, Treuli Y seie to you, that oon of you schal bitraye me.
24073	40	26	22	And thei ful sori bigunnen ech bi hym silf to seie, Lord, whether `Y am?
24074	40	26	23	And he answeride, and seide, He that puttith with me his hoond in the plater, schal bitraye me.
24075	40	26	24	Forsothe mannus sone goith, as it is writun of hym; but wo to that man, bi whom mannus sone schal be bitrayed; it were good to hym, if that man hadde not be borun.
24076	40	26	25	But Judas that bitraiede hym, answeride, seiynge, Maister, whether `Y am? Jhesus seide to hym, Thou hast seid.
24077	40	26	26	And while thei soupeden, Jhesus took breed, and blesside, and brak, and yaf to hise disciplis, and seide, Take ye, and ete; this is my body.
24078	40	26	27	And he took the cuppe, and dide thankyngis, and yaf to hem,
24079	40	26	28	and seide, Drynke ye alle herof; this is my blood of the newe testament, which schal be sched for many, in to remissioun of synnes.
24080	40	26	29	And Y seie to you, Y schal not drynke fro this tyme, of this fruyt of the vyne, in to that dai whanne Y schal drynke it newe with you, in the kyngdom of my fadir.
24081	40	26	30	And whanne the ympne was seid, thei wenten out in to the mount of Olyuete.
24082	40	26	31	Thanne Jhesus seide to hem, Alle ye schulen suffre sclaundre in me, in this niyt; for it is writun, Y schal smyte the scheeperde, and the scheep of the flok schulen be scaterid.
24083	40	26	32	But aftir that Y schal rise ayen, Y schal go bifore you in to Galilee.
24084	40	26	33	Petre answeride, and seide to hym, Thouy alle schulen be sclaundrid in thee, Y schal neuer be sclaundrid.
24085	40	26	34	Jhesus seide to him, Treuli Y seie to thee, for in this nyyt bifor the cok crowe, thries thou schalt denye me.
24086	40	26	35	Peter seide to him, Yhe, thouy it bihoue that Y die with thee, Y schal not denye thee. Also alle the disciplis seiden.
24087	40	26	36	Thanne Jhesus cam with hem in to a toun, that is seid Jessamanye. And he seide to his disciplis, Sitte ye here, the while Y go thider, and preye.
24088	40	26	37	And whanne he hadde take Peter, and twei sones of Zebedee, he bigan to be heuy and sori.
24089	40	26	38	Thanne he seide to hem, My soule is soreuful to the deeth; abide ye here, and wake ye with me.
24090	40	26	39	And he yede forth a litil, and felde doun on his face, preiynge, and seiynge, My fader, if it is possible, passe this cuppe fro me; netheles not as Y wole, but as thou wolt.
24091	40	26	40	And he cam to his disciplis, and foond hem slepynge. And he seide to Petir, So, whethir ye myyten not oon our wake with me?
24092	40	26	41	Wake ye, and preye ye, that ye entre not in to temptacioun; for the spirit is redi, but the fleisch is sijk.
24093	40	26	42	Eft the secounde tyme he wente, and preyede, seiynge, My fadir, if this cuppe may not passe, but Y drynke hym, thi wille be doon.
24094	40	26	43	And eftsoone he cam, and foond hem slepynge; for her iyen weren heuyed.
24095	40	26	44	And he lefte hem, and wente eftsoone, and preiede the thridde tyme, and seide the same word.
24096	40	26	45	Thanne he cam to his disciplis, and seide to hem, Slepe ye now, and reste ye; loo! the our hath neiyed, and mannus sone schal be takun in to the hondis of synneris;
24097	40	26	46	rise ye, go we; loo! he that schal take me, is nyy.
24098	40	26	47	Yit the while he spak, lo! Judas, oon of the twelue, cam, and with hym a greet cumpeny, with swerdis and battis, sent fro the princis of prestis, and fro the eldre men of the puple.
24099	40	26	48	And he that bitraiede hym, yaf to hem a tokene, and seide, Whom euer Y schal kisse, he it is; holde ye hym.
24100	40	26	49	And anoon he cam to Jhesu, and seid, Haile, maister;
24101	40	26	50	and he kisside hym. And Jhesus seide to hym, Freend, wherto art thou comun? Thanne thei camen niy, and leiden hoondis on Jhesu, and helden hym.
24102	40	26	51	And lo! oon of hem that weren with Jhesu, streiyte out his hoond, and drouy out his swerd; and he smoot the seruaunt of the prince of prestis, and kitte of his ere.
24103	40	26	52	Thanne Jhesus seide to hym, Turne thi swerd in to his place; for alle that taken swerd, schulen perische bi swerd.
24104	40	26	53	Whether gessist thou, that Y may not preie my fadir, and he schal yyue to me now mo than twelue legiouns of aungels?
24105	40	26	54	Hou thanne schulen the scriptures be fulfilled? for so it bihoueth to be doon.
24106	40	26	55	In that our Jhesus seide to the puple, As to a theef ye han gon out, with swerdis and battis, to take me; dai bi dai Y sat among you, and tauyt in the temple, and ye helden me not.
24107	40	26	56	But al this thing was don, that the scripturis of profetis schulden be fulfillid. Thanne alle the disciplis fledden, and leften hym.
24108	40	26	57	And thei helden Jhesu, and ledden hym to Cayfas, the prince of prestis, where the scribis and the Farisees, and the eldre men of the puple weren comun togidere.
24109	40	26	58	But Petir swede him afer, in to the halle of the prince of prestis; and he wente in, and sat with the seruauntis, to se the ende.
24110	40	26	59	And the prince of prestis, and al the counsel souyten fals witnessing ayens Jhesu, that thei schulden take hym to deeth;
24111	40	26	60	and thei founden not, whanne manye false witnessis weren comun. But at the laste, twei false witnessis camen,
24112	40	26	61	and seiden, `This seide, Y may distruye the temple of God, and after the thridde dai bilde it ayen.
24113	40	26	62	And the prince of prestis roos, and seide to hym, Answerist thou no thing to tho thingis, that these witnessen ayens thee?
24114	40	26	63	But Jhesus was stille. And the prince of prestis seide to hym, Y coniure thee bi lyuynge God, that thou seie to vs, if thou art Crist, the sone of God.
24115	40	26	64	Jhesus seide to him, Thou hast seid; netheles Y seie to you, `fro hennus forth ye schulen se mannus sone sittinge at the riythalf of the vertu of God, and comynge in the cloudis of heuene.
24116	40	26	65	Thanne the prince of prestis to-rente his clothis, and seide, He hath blasfemed; what yit han we nede to witnessis? lo! now ye han herd blasfemye; what semeth to you?
24117	40	26	66	And thei answeriden, and seiden, He is gilti of deeth.
24118	40	26	67	Thanne thei speten `in to his face, and smyten hym with buffatis; and othere yauen strokis with the pawme of her hondis in his face,
24119	40	26	68	and seide, Thou Crist, arede to vs, who is he that smoot thee?
24120	40	26	69	And Petir sat with outen in the halle; and a damysel cam to hym, and seide, Thou were with Jhesu of Galilee.
24121	40	26	70	And he denyede bifor alle men, and seide, Y woot not what thou seist.
24122	40	26	71	And whanne he yede out at the yate, another damysel say hym, and seide to hem that weren there, And this was with Jhesu of Nazareth.
24123	40	26	72	And eftsoone he denyede with an ooth, For I knewe not the man.
24124	40	26	73	And a litil aftir, thei that stooden camen, and seiden to Petir, Treuli thou art of hem; for thi speche makith thee knowun.
24125	40	26	74	Thanne he bigan to warie and to swere, that he knewe not the man. And anoon the cok crewe.
24126	40	26	75	And Petir bithouyte on the word of Jhesu, that he hadde seid, Bifore the cok crowe, thries thou schalt denye me. And he yede out, and wepte bitterli.
24127	40	27	1	But whanne the morowtid was comun, alle the princis of prestis, and the eldre men of the puple token counsel ayens Jhesu, that thei schulden take hym to the deeth.
24128	40	27	2	And thei ledden him boundun, and bitoken to Pilat of Pounce, iustice.
24129	40	27	3	Thanne Judas that bitraiede hym, say that he was dampned, he repentide, and brouyte ayen the thretti pans to the princis of prestis, and to the elder men of the puple,
24130	40	27	4	and seide, Y haue synned, bitraiynge riytful blood. And thei seiden, What to vs? bise thee.
24131	40	27	5	And whanne he hadde cast forth the siluer in the temple, he passide forth, and yede, and hongide hym silf with a snare.
24132	40	27	6	And the princis of prestis token the siluer, and seide, It is not leueful to putte it in to the treserie, for it is the prijs of blood.
24133	40	27	7	And whanne thei hadden take counsel, thei bouyten with it a feeld of a potter, in to biryyng of pilgrymys.
24134	40	27	8	Herfor thilke feeld is clepid Acheldemac, that is, a feeld of blood, in to this dai.
24135	40	27	9	Thanne that was fulfillid, that was seid bi the prophete Jeremye, seiynge, And thei han takun thretti pans, the prijs of a man preysid, whom thei preiseden of the children of Israel;
24136	40	27	10	and thei yauen hem in to a feeld of a potter, as the Lord hath ordenyd to me.
24137	40	27	11	And Jhesus stood bifor the domesman; and the iustice axide him, and seide, Art thou king of Jewis?
24138	40	27	12	Jhesus seith to hym, Thou seist. And whanne he was accusid of the princis of prestis, and of the eldere men of the puple, he answeride no thing.
24139	40	27	13	Thanne Pilat seith to him, Herist thou not, hou many witnessyngis thei seien ayens thee?
24140	40	27	14	And he answeride not `to hym ony word, so that the iustice wondride greetli.
24141	40	27	15	But for a solempne dai the iustice was wont to delyuere to the puple oon boundun, whom thei wolden.
24142	40	27	16	And he hadde tho a famous man boundun, that was seid Barrabas.
24143	40	27	17	Therfor Pilate seide to hem, whanne thei weren to gidere, Whom wolen ye, that Y delyuere to you? whether Barabas, or Jhesu, that is seid Crist?
24144	40	27	18	For he wiste, that bi enuye thei bitraieden hym.
24145	40	27	19	And while he sat for domesman, his wijf sente to hym, and seide, No thing to thee and to that iust man; for Y haue suffrid this dai many thingis for hym, bi a visioun.
24146	40	27	20	Forsothe the prince of prestis, and the eldere men counseiliden the puple, that thei schulden axe Barabas, but thei schulden distrye Jhesu.
24147	40	27	21	But the iustice answeride, and seide to hem, Whom of the tweyn wolen ye, that be delyuerit to you? And thei seiden, Barabas.
24148	40	27	22	Pilat seith to hem, What thanne schal Y do of Jhesu, that is seid Crist?
24149	40	27	23	Alle seien, `Be he crucified. The iustice seith to hem, What yuel hath he doon? And thei crieden more, and seiden, Be he crucified.
24150	40	27	24	And Pilat seynge that he profitide no thing, but that the more noyse was maad, took watir, and waischide hise hondis bifor the puple, and seide, Y am giltles of the blood of this riytful man; bise you.
24151	40	27	25	And al the puple answeride, and seide, His blood be on vs, and on oure children.
24152	40	27	26	Thanne he deliuerede to hem Barabas, but he took to hem Jhesu scourgid, to be crucified.
24153	40	27	27	Thanne knyytis of the iustice token Jhesu in the moot halle, and gadriden to hym al the cumpeny `of knyytis.
24154	40	27	28	And thei vnclothiden hym, and diden aboute hym a reed mantil;
24155	40	27	29	and thei foldiden a coroun of thornes, and putten on his heed, and a rehed in his riyt hoond; and thei kneliden bifore hym, and scornyden hym, and seiden, Heil, kyng of Jewis.
24156	40	27	30	And thei speten on hym, and tooken a rehed, and smoot his heed.
24157	40	27	31	And aftir that thei hadden scorned him, thei vnclothiden hym of the mantil, and thei clothiden hym with hise clothis, and ledden hym to `crucifien hym.
24158	40	27	32	And as thei yeden out, thei founden a man of Cirenen comynge fro the toun, Symont bi name; thei constreyneden hym to take his cross.
24159	40	27	33	And thei camen in to a place that is clepid Golgatha, that is, the place of Caluarie.
24160	40	27	34	And thei yauen hym to drynke wyne meynd with galle; and whanne he hadde tastid, he wolde not drynke.
24161	40	27	35	And aftir that thei hadden crucified hym, thei departiden his clothis, and kesten lotte, to fulfille that is seid bi the prophete, seiynge, Thei partiden to hem my clothis, and on my clooth thei kesten lott.
24162	40	27	36	And thei seten, and kepten him;
24163	40	27	37	and setten aboue his heed his cause writun, This is Jhesu of Nazareth, kyng of Jewis.
24164	40	27	38	Thanne twey theues weren crucified with hym, oon on the riythalf, and oon on the lefthalf.
24165	40	27	39	And men that passiden forth blasfemeden hym,
24166	40	27	40	mouynge her heedis, and seiynge, Vath to thee, that distriest the temple of God, and in the thridde dai bildist it ayen; saue thou thi silf; if thou art the sone of God, come doun of the cross.
24167	40	27	41	Also and princis of prestis scornynge, with scribis and elder men,
24168	40	27	42	seiden, He made othere men saaf, he may not make hym silf saaf; if he is kyng of Israel, come he now doun fro the crosse, and we bileuen to hym;
24169	40	27	43	he tristide in God; delyuer he hym now, if he wole; for he seide, That Y am Goddis sone.
24170	40	27	44	And the theues, that weren crucified with hym, vpbreididen hym of the same thing.
24171	40	27	45	But fro the sixte our derknessis weren maad on al the erthe, to the nynthe our.
24172	40	27	46	And aboute the nynthe our Jhesus criede with a greet vois, and seide, Heli, Heli, lamazabatany, that is, My God, my God, whi hast thou forsake me?
24173	40	27	47	And summen that stoden there, and herynge, seiden, This clepith Helye.
24174	40	27	48	And anoon oon of hem rennynge, took and fillide a spounge with vynegre, and puttide on a rehed, and yaf to hym to drynke.
24175	40	27	49	But othir seiden, Suffre thou; se we whether Helie come to deliuer hym.
24176	40	27	50	Forsothe Jhesus eftsoone criede with a greet voyce, and yaf vp the goost.
24177	40	27	51	And lo! the veil of the temple was to-rent in twey parties, fro the hiest to the lowest. And the erthe schoke, and stoonus weren cloue; and birielis weren openyd,
24178	40	27	52	and many bodies of seyntis that hadden slepte, rysen vp.
24179	40	27	53	And thei yeden out of her birielis, and aftir his resurreccioun thei camen in to the holi citee, and apperiden to many.
24180	40	27	54	And the centurien and thei that weren with hym kepinge Jhesu, whanne thei saien the erthe schakynge, and tho thingis that weren doon, thei dredden greetli,
24181	40	27	55	and seiden, Verili this was Goddis sone. And ther weren there many wymmen afer, that sueden Jhesu fro Galilee, and mynystriden to hym.
24182	40	27	56	Among whiche was Marie Magdalene, and Marie, the modir of James, and of Joseph, and the modir of Zebedees sones.
24183	40	27	57	But whanne the euenyng was come, ther cam a riche man of Armathi, Joseph bi name, and he was a disciple of Jhesu.
24184	40	27	58	He wente to Pilat, and axide the bodi of Jhesu.
24185	40	27	59	Thanne Pilat comaundide the bodie to be youun. And whanne the bodi was takun, Joseph lappide it in a clene sendel,
24186	40	27	60	and leide it in his newe biriel, that he hadde hewun in a stoon; and he walewide a greet stoon to the dore of the biriel, and wente awei.
24187	40	27	61	But Marie Maudelene and anothir Marie weren there, sittynge ayens the sepulcre.
24188	40	27	62	And on `the tother dai, that is aftir pask euen, the princis of prestis and the Farisees camen togidere to Pilat,
24189	40	27	63	and seiden, Sir, we han mynde, that thilke giloure seide yit lyuynge, Aftir thre daies Y schal rise ayen to lijf.
24190	40	27	64	Therfor comaunde thou, that the sepulcre be kept in to the thridde dai; lest hise disciplis comen, and stelen hym, and seie to the puple, He hath rise fro deeth; and the laste errour schal be worse than the formere.
24191	40	27	65	Pilat seide to hem, Ye han the kepyng; go ye, kepe ye as ye kunnen.
24192	40	27	66	And thei yeden forth, and kepten the sepulcre, markynge the stoon, with keperis.
24193	40	28	1	But in the euentid of the sabat, that bigynneth to schyne in the firste dai of the woke, Marie Mawdelene cam, and another Marie, to se the sepulcre.
24194	40	28	2	And lo! ther was maad a greet ertheschakyng; for the aungel of the Lord cam doun fro heuene, and neiyede, and turnede awei the stoon, and sat theron.
24195	40	28	3	And his lokyng was as leit, and hise clothis as snowe;
24196	40	28	4	and for drede of hym the keperis weren afeerd, and thei weren maad as deede men.
24197	40	28	5	But the aungel answeride, and seide to the wymmen, Nyle ye drede, for Y woot that ye seken Jhesu, that was crucified;
24198	40	28	6	he is not here, for he is risun, as he seide; come ye, and se ye the place, where the Lord was leid.
24199	40	28	7	And go ye soone, and seie ye to his disciplis, that he is risun. And lo! he schal go bifore you in to Galilee; there ye schulen se hym.
24200	40	28	8	Lo! Y haue biforseid to you. And thei wenten out soone fro the biriels, with drede and greet ioye, rennynge to telle to hise disciplis.
24201	40	28	9	And lo! Jhesus mette hem, and seide, Heile ye. And thei neiyeden, and heelden his feet, and worschipiden him.
24202	40	28	10	Thanne Jhesus seide to hem, Nyle ye drede; go ye, `telle ye to my britheren, that thei go in to Galile; there thei schulen se me.
24203	40	28	11	And whanne thei weren goon, lo! summe of the keperis camen in to the citee, and telden to the princis of prestis alle thingis that weren doon.
24204	40	28	12	And whanne thei weren gaderid togidere with the elder men, and hadden take her counseil, thei yauen to the kniytis miche monei, and seiden, Seie ye,
24205	40	28	13	that hise disciplis camen bi nyyt, and han stolen hym, while ye slepten.
24206	40	28	14	And if this be herd of the iustice, we schulen counseile hym, and make you sikir.
24207	40	28	15	And whanne the monei was takun, thei diden, as thei weren tauyt. And this word is pupplischid among the Jewis, til in to this day.
24208	40	28	16	And the enleuen disciplis wenten in to Galilee, in to an hille, where Jhesus hadde ordeyned to hem.
24209	40	28	17	And thei sayn hym, and worschipiden; but summe of hem doutiden.
24210	40	28	18	And Jhesus cam nyy, and spak to hem, and seide, Al power in heuene and in erthe is youun to me.
24211	40	28	19	Therfor go ye, and teche alle folkis, baptisynge hem in the name of the Fadir, and of the Sone, and of the Hooli Goost;

24214	41	1	2	As it is writun in Ysaie, the prophete, Lo! Y sende myn aungel bifor thi face, that schal make thi weie redi bifor thee.
24215	41	1	3	The vois of a crier in desert, Make ye redi the weie of the Lord, make ye hise paththis riyt.
24216	41	1	4	Joon was in desert baptisynge, and prechynge the baptym of penaunce, in to remissioun of synnes.
24217	41	1	5	And al the cuntre of Judee wente out to hym, and alle men of Jerusalem; and thei weren baptisid of hym in the flom Jordan, `and knoulechiden her synnes.
24218	41	1	6	And Joon was clothid with heeris of camels, and a girdil of skyn was about hise leendis; and he ete hony soukis, and wilde hony, and prechide,

24223	41	1	11	And a vois was maad fro heuenes, Thou art my loued sone, in thee Y am plesid.
24224	41	1	12	And anoon the Spirit puttide hym forth in to deseert.
24225	41	1	13	And he was in deseert fourti daies and fourti nyytis, and was temptid of Sathanas, and he was with beestis, and aungels mynystriden to hym.
24226	41	1	14	But aftir that Joon was takun, Jhesus cam in to Galilee, and prechide the gospel of the kyngdoom of God,
24227	41	1	15	and seide, That the tyme is fulfillid, and the kyngdoom of God schal come nyy; do ye penaunce, and bileue ye to the gospel.
24228	41	1	16	And as he passide bisidis the see of Galilee, he say Symount, and Andrew, his brother, castynge her nettis in to the see; for thei weren fisscheris.

24237	41	1	25	And Jhesus thretenede hym, and seide, Wex doumbe, and go out of the man.
24238	41	1	26	And the vnclene spirit debreidynge hym, and criynge with greet vois, wente out fro hym.

24247	41	1	35	And he roos ful eerli, and yede out, and wente in to a desert place, and preiede there.
24248	41	1	36	And Symount suede hym, and thei that weren with hym.
24249	41	1	37	And whanne thei hadden founde hym, thei seiden to hym, That alle men seken thee.
24250	41	1	38	And he seide to hem, Go we in to the next townes and citees, that Y preche also there, for her to Y cam.
24251	41	1	39	And he prechide in the synagogis of hem, and in al Galilee, and castide out feendis.
24252	41	1	40	And a leprouse man cam to hym, and bisouyte, `and knelide, and seide, If thou wolt, thou maist clense me.
24253	41	1	41	And Jhesus hadde mercy on hym, and streiyte out his hoond, and towchyde hym, and seide to hym, I wole, be thou maad cleene.
24254	41	1	42	And whanne he hadde seide this, anoon the lepre partyde awey fro hym, and he was clensyd.
24255	41	1	43	And Jhesus thretenede hym, and anoon Jhesus putte hym out,
24256	41	1	44	and seyde to hym, Se thou, seye to no man; but go, schewe thee to the pryncys of prestys, and offre for thi clensynge in to wytnessyng to hem, tho thingis that Moyses bad.
24257	41	1	45	And he yede out, and bigan to preche, and publische the word, so that now he myyte not go opynli in to the citee, but be withoutforth in desert placis; and thei camen to hym on alle sidis.
24258	41	2	1	And eft he entride in to Cafarnaum, aftir eiyte daies.
24259	41	2	2	And it was herd, that he was in an hous, and many camen to gidir, so that thei miyten not be in the hous, ne at the yate. And he spak to hem the word.
24260	41	2	3	And there camen to hym men that brouyten a man sijk in palesie, which was borun of foure.
24261	41	2	4	And whanne thei myyten not brynge hym to Jhesu for the puple, thei vnhileden the roof where he was, and openede it, and thei leten doun the bed in which the sijk man in palesie laye.
24262	41	2	5	And whanne Jhesus hadde seyn the feith of hem, he seide to the sijk man in palesie, Sone, thi synnes ben foryouun to thee.
24263	41	2	6	But there weren summe of the scribis sittynge, and thenkynge in her hertis,
24264	41	2	7	What spekith he thus? He blasfemeth; who may foryyue synnes, but God aloone?
24265	41	2	8	And whanne Jhesus hadde knowe this bi the Hooli Goost, that thei thouyten so with ynne hem silf, he seith to hem, What thenken ye these thingis in youre hertis?
24266	41	2	9	What is liyter to seie to the sijk man in palesie, Synnes ben foryouun to thee, or to seie, Ryse, take thi bed, and walke?
24267	41	2	10	But that ye wite that mannus sone hath power in erthe to foryyue synnes, he seide to the sijk man in palesie, Y seie to thee,
24268	41	2	11	ryse vp, take thi bed, and go in to thin hous.
24269	41	2	12	And anoon he roos vp, and whanne he hadde take the bed, he wente bifor alle men, so that alle men wondriden, and onoureden God, and seiden, For we seien neuer so.
24270	41	2	13	And he wente out eftsoone to the see, and al the puple cam to hym; and he tauyte hem.
24271	41	2	14	And whanne he passide, he saiy Leuy `of Alfei sittynge at the tolbothe, and he seide to hym, Sue me. And he roos, and suede hym.
24272	41	2	15	And it was doon, whanne he sat at the mete in his hous, many pupplicans and synful men saten togidere at the mete with Jhesu and hise disciplis; for there weren many that folewiden hym.
24273	41	2	16	And scribis and Farisees seynge, that he eet with pupplicans and synful men, seiden to hise disciplis, Whi etith and drynkith youre maystir with pupplicans and synneris?
24274	41	2	17	Whanne this was herd, Jhesus seide to hem, Hoole men han no nede to a leche, but thei that ben yuel at eese; for Y cam not to clepe iust men, but synneris.
24275	41	2	18	And the disciplis of Joon and the Farisees weren fastynge; and thei camen, and seien to hym, Whi fasten the disciplis of Joon, and the Farisees fasten, but thi disciplis fasten not?
24276	41	2	19	And Jhesus seide to hem, Whether the sones of sposailis moun faste, as longe as the spouse is with hem? As long tyme as thei haue the spouse with hem, thei moun not faste.
24277	41	2	20	But daies schulen come, whanne the spouse schal be takun awei fro hem, and thanne thei schulen faste in tho daies.
24278	41	2	21	No man sewith a patche of newe clooth to an elde clooth, ellis he takith awei the newe patche fro the elde, and a more brekyng is maad.
24279	41	2	22	And no man puttith newe wyn in to elde botelis, ellis the wyn schal breste the botels, and the wyn schal be sched out, and the botels schulen perische. But newe wyn schal be put into newe botels.
24280	41	2	23	And it was doon eftsoones, whanne the Lord walkid in the sabotis bi the cornes, and hise disciplis bigunnen to passe forth, and plucke eeris of the corn.
24281	41	2	24	And the Farisees seiden to hym, Lo! what thi disciplis doon in sabotis, that is not leeueful.
24282	41	2	25	And he seide to hem, Radden ye neuer what Dauid dide, whanne he hadde nede, and he hungride, and thei that weren with hym?
24283	41	2	26	Hou he wente in to the hous of God, vndur Abiathar, prince of prestis, and eete looues of proposicioun, which it was not leeueful to ete, but to preestis aloone, and he yaf to hem that weren with hym.
24284	41	2	27	And he seide to hem, The sabat is maad for man, and not a man for the sabat; and so mannus sone is lord also of the sabat.
24285	41	3	1	And he entride eftsoone in to the synagoge, and there was a man hauynge a drye hoond.
24286	41	3	2	And thei aspieden hym, if he helide in the sabatis, to accuse him.
24287	41	3	3	And he seide to the man that hadde a drie hoond, Rise in to the myddil.
24288	41	3	4	And he seith to hem, Is it leeueful to do wel in the sabatis, ether yuel? to make a soul saaf, ether to leese? And thei weren stille.
24289	41	3	5	And he biheeld hem aboute with wraththe, and hadde sorewe on the blyndnesse of her herte, and seith to the man, Hold forth thin hoond. And he helde forth, and his hoond was restorid to hym.
24290	41	3	6	Sotheli Farisees yeden out anoon, and maden a counsel with Erodians ayens hym, hou thei schulden lese hym.
24291	41	3	7	But Jhesus with hise disciplis wente to the see; and myche puple fro Galilee and Judee suede hym,
24292	41	3	8	and fro Jerusalem, and fro Ydume, and fro biyondis Jordan, and thei that weren aboute Tire and Sidon, a greet multitude, heringe the thingis that he dide, and cam to hym.
24293	41	3	9	And Jhesus seide to hise disciplis, that the boot schulde serue hym, for the puple, lest thei thristen hym;
24294	41	3	10	for he heelide many, so that thei felden fast to hym, to touche hym. And hou many euer hadde syknessis, and vnclene spirits,
24295	41	3	11	whanne thei seyen hym, felden doun to hym, and crieden, seiynge, Thou art the sone of God.
24296	41	3	12	And greetli he manasside hem, that thei schulden not make hym knowun.
24297	41	3	13	And he wente in to an hille, and clepide to hym whom he wolde; and thei camen to hym.
24298	41	3	14	And he made, that there weren twelue with hym, to sende hem to preche.
24299	41	3	15	And he yaf to hem pouwer to heele sijknessis, and to caste out feendis.
24300	41	3	16	And to Symount he yaf a name Petre, and he clepide James of Zebede and Joon,
24301	41	3	17	the brother of James, and he yaf to hem names Boenarges, that is, sones of thundryng.
24302	41	3	18	And he clepide Andrew and Filip, and Bartholomew and Matheu, and Thomas and James Alfey, and Thadee,
24303	41	3	19	and Symount Cananee, and Judas Scarioth, that bitraiede hym.
24304	41	3	20	And thei camen to an hous, and the puple cam togidere eftsoone, so that thei miyten not ete breed.
24305	41	3	21	And whanne his kynnysmen hadden herd, thei wenten out `to holde him; for thei seiden, that he is turned in to woodnesse.
24306	41	3	22	And the scribis that camen doun fro Jerusalem, seiden, That he hath Belsabub, and that in the prince of deuelis he castith out fendis.
24307	41	3	23	And he clepide hem togidir, and he seide to hem in parablis, Hou may Sathanas caste out Sathanas?
24308	41	3	24	And if a rewme be departid ayens it silf, thilke rewme may not stonde.
24309	41	3	25	And if an hous be disparpoilid on it silf, thilke hous may not stonde.
24310	41	3	26	And if Sathanas hath risun ayens hym silf, he is departid, and he schal not mowe stonde, but hath an ende.
24311	41	3	27	No man may go in to a stronge mannus hous, and take awey hise vessels, but he bynde first the stronge man, and thanne he schal spoile his hous.
24312	41	3	28	Treuli Y seie to you, that alle synnes and blasfemyes, bi whiche thei han blasfemed, schulen be foryouun to the sones of men.
24313	41	3	29	But he that blasfemeth ayens the Hooli Goost, hath not remissioun in to with outen ende, but he schal be gilty of euerlastynge trespas.
24314	41	3	30	For thei seiden, He hath an vnclene spirit.
24315	41	3	31	And his modir and britheren camen, and thei stoden withoutforth, and senten to hym, and clepiden hym.
24316	41	3	32	And the puple sat aboute hym; and thei seien to hym, Lo! thi modir and thi britheren with outforth seken thee.
24317	41	3	33	And he answeride to hem, and seide, Who is my modir and my britheren?
24318	41	3	34	And he bihelde thilke that saten aboute hym, and seide, Lo! my modir and my britheren.
24319	41	3	35	For who that doith the wille of God, he is my brothir, and my sistir, and modir.
24320	41	4	1	And eft Jhesus bigan to teche at the see; and myche puple was gaderid to hym, so that he wente in to a boot, and sat in the see, and al the puple was aboute the see on the loond.
24321	41	4	2	And he tauyte hem in parablis many thingis. And he seide to hem in his techyng,
24322	41	4	3	Here ye. Lo! a man sowynge goith out to sowe.
24323	41	4	4	And the while he sowith, summe seed felde aboute the weie, and briddis of heuene camen, and eeten it.
24324	41	4	5	Othere felde doun on stony places, where it had not myche erthe; and anoon it spronge vp, for it had not depnesse of erthe.
24325	41	4	6	And whanne the sunne roos vp, it welewide for heete, and it driede vp, for it hadde no roote.
24326	41	4	7	And othere felde doun in to thornes, and thornes sprongen vp, and strangliden it, and it yaf not fruyt.
24327	41	4	8	And other felde doun in to good loond, and yaf fruyt, springynge vp, and wexynge; and oon brouyte thretti foold, and oon sixti fold, and oon an hundrid fold.
24328	41	4	9	And he seide, He that hath eeris of heryng, here he.
24329	41	4	10	And whanne he was bi hym silf, tho twelue that weren with hym axiden hym to expowne the parable.
24330	41	4	11	And he seide to hem, To you it is youun to knowe the priuete of the kyngdom of God. But to hem that ben with outforth, alle thingis be maad in parablis, that thei seynge se,
24331	41	4	12	and se not, and thei herynge here and vnderstonde not; lest sum tyme thei be conuertid, and synnes be foryouun to hem.
24332	41	4	13	And he seide to hem, Knowe not ye this parable? and hou ye schulen knowe alle parablis?
24333	41	4	14	He that sowith, sowith a word.
24334	41	4	15	But these it ben that ben aboute the weie, where the word is sowun; and whanne thei han herd, anoon cometh Satanas, and takith awei the word that is sowun in her hertis.
24335	41	4	16	And in lijk maner ben these that ben sowun on stony placis, whiche whanne thei han herd the word, anoon thei taken it with ioye;
24336	41	4	17	and thei han not roote in hem silf, but thei ben lastynge a litil tyme; aftirward whanne tribulacioun risith, and persecucioun for the word, anoon thei ben sclaundrid.
24337	41	4	18	And ther ben othir that ben sowun in thornes; these it ben that heren the word,
24338	41	4	19	and disese of the world, and disseit of ritchessis, and othir charge of coueytise entrith, and stranglith the word, and it is maad with out fruyt.
24339	41	4	20	And these it ben that ben sowun on good lond, whiche heren the word, and taken, and maken fruyt, oon thritti fold, oon sixti fold, and oon an hundrid fold.
24340	41	4	21	And he seide to hem, Wher a lanterne cometh, that it be put vndur a buschel, or vndur a bed? nay, but that it be put on a candilstike?
24341	41	4	22	Ther is no thing hid, that schal not be maad opyn; nethir ony thing is pryuey, that schal not come in to opyn.
24342	41	4	23	If ony man haue eeris of heryng, here he.
24343	41	4	24	And he seide to hem, Se ye what ye heren. In what mesure ye meten, it schal be metun to you ayen, and be cast to you.
24344	41	4	25	For it schal be youun to hym that hath, and it schal be takun awei fro him that hath not, also that that he hath.
24345	41	4	26	And he seide, So the kingdom of God is, as if a man caste seede in to the erthe,
24346	41	4	27	and he sleepe, and it rise up niyt and dai, and brynge forth seede, and wexe faste, while he woot not.
24347	41	4	28	For the erthe makith fruyt, first the gras, aftirward the ere, and aftir ful fruyt in the ere.
24348	41	4	29	And whanne of it silf it hath brouyt forth fruyt, anoon he sendith a sikil, for repyng tyme is come.
24349	41	4	30	And he seide, To what thing schulen we likne the kyngdom of God? or to what parable schulen we comparisoun it?
24350	41	4	31	As a corne of seneuei, which whanne it is sowun in the erthe, is lesse than alle seedis that ben in the erthe;
24351	41	4	32	and whanne it is sprongun up, it waxith in to a tre, and is maad gretter than alle erbis; and it makith grete braunchis, so that briddis of heuene moun dwelle vndur the schadewe therof.
24352	41	4	33	And in many suche parablis he spak to hem the word, as thei myyten here;
24353	41	4	34	and he spak not to hem with out parable. But he expownede to hise disciplis alle thingis bi hemsilf.
24354	41	4	35	And he seide to hem in that dai, whanne euenyng was come, Passe we ayenward.
24355	41	4	36	And thei leften the puple, and token hym, so that he was in a boot; and othere bootys weren with hym.
24356	41	4	37	And a greet storm of wynde was maad, and keste wawis in to the boot, so that the boot was ful.
24357	41	4	38	And he was in the hyndir part of the boot, and slepte on a pilewe. And thei reisen hym, and seien to hym, Maistir, perteyneth it not to thee, that we perischen?
24358	41	4	39	And he roos vp, and manasside the wynde, and seide to the see, Be stille, wexe doumbe. And the wynde ceesside, and greet pesiblenesse was maad.
24359	41	4	40	And he seide to hem, What dreden ye? `Ye han no feith yit? And thei dredden with greet drede, and seiden `ech to other, Who, gessist thou, is this? for the wynde and the see obeschen to hym.
24360	41	5	1	And thei camen ouer the see in to the cuntree of Gerasenes.
24361	41	5	2	And aftir that he was goon out of the boot, anoon a man in an vncleene spirit ran out of birielis to hym.
24362	41	5	3	Which man hadde an hous in biriels, and nether with cheynes now myyte ony man bynde hym.
24363	41	5	4	For ofte tymes he was boundun in stockis and chaynes, and he hadde broke the chaynes, and hadde broke the stockis to smale gobetis, and no man myyte make hym tame.
24364	41	5	5	And euermore, nyyt and dai, in birielis and in hillis, he was criynge and betynge hym silf with stoonus.
24365	41	5	6	And he siy Jhesus afer, and ran, and worschipide hym.
24366	41	5	7	And he criede with greet voice, and seide, What to me and to thee, thou Jhesu, the sone of the hiyest God? Y coniure thee bi God, that thou turmente me not.
24367	41	5	8	And Jhesus seide to hym, Thou vnclene spirit, go out fro the man.
24368	41	5	9	And Jhesus axide hym, What is thi name? And he seith to hym, A legioun is my name; for we ben many.
24369	41	5	10	And he preiede Jhesu myche, that he schulde not putte hym out of the cuntrei.
24370	41	5	11	And there was there aboute the hille a greet flok of swyn lesewynge.
24371	41	5	12	And the spiritis preieden Jhesu, and seiden, Sende vs into the swyn, that we entre in to hem.
24372	41	5	13	And anoon Jhesus grauntide to hem. And the vnclene spiritis yeden out, and entriden in to the swyn, and with a greet birre the flocke was cast doun in to the see, a twei thousynde, and thei weren dreynt in the see.
24373	41	5	14	And thei that kepten hem, fledden, and tolden in to the citee, and in to the feeldis; and thei wenten out, to se what was don.
24374	41	5	15	And thei camen to Jhesu, and sayn hym that hadde be trauelid of the feend, syttynge clothid, and of hool mynde; and thei dredden.
24375	41	5	16	And thei that saien, hou it was don to hym that hadde a feend, and of the swyne, telden to hem.
24376	41	5	17	And thei bigunnen to preie hym, that he schulde go a wei fro her coostis.
24377	41	5	18	And whanne he yede up in to a boot, he that was trauelid of the deuel, bigan to preie hym, that he schulde be with hym.
24378	41	5	19	But Jhesus resseyuede hym not, but seide to hym, Go thou in to thin hous to thine, and telle to hem, hou grete thingis the Lord hath don to thee, and hadde merci of thee.
24379	41	5	20	And he wente forth, and bigan to preche in Decapoli, hou grete thingis Jhesus hadde don to hym; and alle men wondriden.
24380	41	5	21	And whanne Jhesus hadde gon vp in to the boot eftsoone ouer the see, myche puple cam togidere to him, and was aboute the see.
24381	41	5	22	And oon of the princis of synagogis, bi name Jayrus, cam, and siy hym, and felde doun at hise feet,
24382	41	5	23	and preyede hym myche, and seide, My douyter is nyy deed; come thou, putte thin hoond on her, that sche be saaf, and lyue.
24383	41	5	24	And he wente forth with hym, and myche puple suede hym, and thruste hym.
24384	41	5	25	And a womman hadde ben in the blodi fluxe twelue yeer,
24385	41	5	26	and hadde resseyued many thingis of ful many lechis, and hadde spendid al hir good, and was nothing amendid, but was rather the wors, whanne sche hadde herd of Jhesu,
24386	41	5	27	sche cam among the puple bihynde, and touchide his cloth.
24387	41	5	28	For sche seide, That if Y touche yhe his cloth, Y schal be saaf.
24388	41	5	29	And anoon the welle of hir blood was dried vp, and sche felide in bodi that sche was heelid of the siknesse.
24389	41	5	30	And anoon Jhesus knewe in hym silf the vertu that was goon out of hym, and turnede to the puple, and seide, Who touchide my clothis?
24390	41	5	31	And hise disciplis seiden to hym, Thou seest the puple thristynge thee, and seist, Who touchide me?
24391	41	5	32	And Jhesus lokide aboute to se hir that hadde don this thing.
24392	41	5	33	And the womman dredde, and quakide, witynge that it was doon in hir, and cam, and felde doun bifor hym, and seide to hym al the treuthe.
24393	41	5	34	And Jhesus seide to hyr, Douytir, thi feith hath maad thee saaf; go in pees, and he thou hool of thi sijknesse.
24394	41	5	35	Yit while he spak, messangeris camen to the prince of the synagoge, and seien, Thi douytir is deed; what traueilist thou the maistir ferther?
24395	41	5	36	But whanne the word was herd that was seid, Jhesus seide to the prince of the synagoge, Nyle thou drede, oonli bileue thou.
24396	41	5	37	And he took no man to sue hym, but Petir, and James, and Joon, the brother of James.
24397	41	5	38	And thei camen in to the hous of the prince of the synagoge. And he saie noyse, and men wepynge and weilynge myche.
24398	41	5	39	And he yede ynne, and seide to hem, What ben ye troublid, and wepen? The damesel is not deed, but slepith.
24399	41	5	40	And thei scorneden hym. But whanne alle weren put out, he takith the fadir and the modir of the damesel, and hem that weren with hym, and thei entren, where the damysel laye.
24400	41	5	41	And he helde the hoond of the damesel, and seide to hir, Tabita, cumy, that is to seie, Damysel, Y seie to thee, arise.
24401	41	5	42	And anoon the damysel roos, and walkide; and sche was of twelue yeer. And thei weren abaischid with a greet stonying. And he comaundide to hem greetli, that no man schulde wite it.
24402	41	5	43	And he comaundide to yyue hir mete.
24403	41	6	1	And he yede out fro thennus, and wente in to his owne cuntre; and hise disciplis folewiden him.

24406	41	6	4	And Jhesus seide to hem, That a profete is not without onoure, but in his owne cuntrey, and among his kynne, and in his hous.
24407	41	6	5	And he myyte not do there ony vertu, saue that he helide a fewe sijk men, leiynge on hem hise hoondis.

24412	41	6	10	And he seide to hem, Whidur euer ye entren in to an hous, dwelle ye there, til ye goon out fro thennus.
24413	41	6	11	And who euer resseyueth you not, ne herith you, go ye out fro thennus, and schake awei the powdir fro youre feet, in to witnessyng to hem.
24414	41	6	12	And thei yeden forth, and prechiden, that men schulden do penaunce.
24415	41	6	13	And thei castiden out many feendis, and anoyntiden with oyle many sijk men, and thei weren heelid.
24416	41	6	14	And kyng Eroude herde, for his name was maad opyn, and seide, That Joon Baptist hath risen ayen fro deeth, and therfor vertues worchen in hym.
24417	41	6	15	Othir seiden, That it is Helie; but othir seiden, That it is a profete, as oon of profetis.
24418	41	6	16	And whanne this thing was herd, Eroude seide, This Joon, whom Y haue biheedide, is risun ayen fro deeth.
24419	41	6	17	For thilke Eroude sente, and helde Joon, and boond hym in to prisoun, for Erodias, the wijf of Filip, his brothir; for he hadde weddid hir.
24420	41	6	18	For Joon seide to Eroude, It is not leueful to thee, to haue the wijf of thi brothir.
24421	41	6	19	And Erodias leide aspies to hym, and wolde sle hym, and myyte not.
24422	41	6	20	And Eroude dredde Joon, and knewe hym a iust man and hooli, and kepte hym. And Eroude herde hym, and he dide many thingis, and gladli herde hym.
24423	41	6	21	And whanne a couenable dai was fallun, Eroude in his birthdai made a soper to the princis, and tribunes, and to the grettest of Galilee.
24424	41	6	22	And whanne the douyter of thilke Erodias was comun ynne, and daunside, and pleside to Eroude, and also to men that saten at the mete, the kyng seide to the damysel, Axe thou of me what thou wolt, and Y schal yyue to thee.
24425	41	6	23	And he swore to hir, That what euer thou axe, Y schal yyue to thee, thouy it be half my kyngdom.
24426	41	6	24	And whanne sche hadde goon out, sche seide to hir modir, What schal Y axe? And sche seide, The heed of Joon Baptist.

24448	41	6	46	And whanne he hadde left hem, he wente in to an hille, to preye.
24449	41	6	47	And whanne it was euen, the boot was in the myddil of the see, and he aloone in the loond;
24450	41	6	48	and he say hem trauelynge in rowyng; for the wynde was contrarie to hem. And aboute the fourthe wakynge of the nyyt, he wandride on the see, and cam to hem, and wolde passe hem.
24451	41	6	49	And as thei sayn hym wandrynge on the see, thei gessiden that it weren a fantum, and crieden out;

24453	41	6	51	And he cam vp to hem in to the boot, and the wynde ceesside. And thei wondriden more `with ynne hem silf;
24454	41	6	52	for thei vndurstoden not of the looues; for her herte was blyndid.
24455	41	6	53	And whanne thei weren passid ouer the see, thei camen in to the lond of Genasareth, and settiden to loond.
24456	41	6	54	And whanne thei weren gon out of the boot, anoon thei knewen hym.

24459	41	7	1	And the Farisees and summe of the scribis camen fro Jerusalem togidir to hym.
24460	41	7	2	And whanne thei hadden seen summe of hise disciplis ete breed with vnwaisschen hoondis, thei blameden.
24461	41	7	3	The Farisees and alle the Jewis eten not, but thei waisschen ofte her hoondis, holdynge the tradiciouns of eldere men.
24462	41	7	4	And whanne thei turnen ayen fro chepyng, thei eten not, but thei ben waisschen; and many other thingis ben, `that ben taken `to hem to kepe, wasschyngis of cuppis, and of watir vessels, and of vessels of bras, and of beddis.
24463	41	7	5	And Farisees and scribis axiden hym, and seiden, Whi gon not thi disciplis aftir the tradicioun of eldere men, but with vnwasschen hondis thei eten breed?
24464	41	7	6	And he answeride, and seide to hem, Ysaie prophesiede wel of you, ypocritis, as it is writun, This puple worschipith me with lippis, but her herte is fer fro me;
24465	41	7	7	and in veyn thei worschipen me, techinge the doctrines and the heestis of men.
24466	41	7	8	For ye leeuen the maundement of God, and holden the tradiciouns of men, wasschyngis of watir vessels, and of cuppis; and many othir thingis lijk to these ye doon.
24467	41	7	9	And he seide to hem, Wel ye han maad the maundement of God voide, `to kepe youre tradicioun.
24468	41	7	10	For Moyses seide, Worschipe thi fadir and thi modir; and he that cursith fadir or modir, die he by deeth.
24469	41	7	11	But ye seien, If a man seie to fadir or modir, Corban, that is, What euer yifte is of me, it schal profite to thee;
24470	41	7	12	and ouer ye suffren not hym do ony thing to fadir or modir,
24471	41	7	13	and ye breken the word of God bi youre tradicioun, that ye han youun; and ye don many suche thingis.
24472	41	7	14	And he eftsoone clepide the puple, and seide to hem, Ye alle here me, and vndurstonde.
24473	41	7	15	No thing that is withouten a man, that entrith in to hym, may defoule him; but tho thingis that comen forth of a man, tho it ben that defoulen a man.
24474	41	7	16	If ony man haue eeris of hering, here he.
24475	41	7	17	And whanne he was entrid in to an hous, fro the puple, hise disciplis axiden hym the parable.
24476	41	7	18	And he seide to hem, Ye ben vnwise also. Vndurstonde ye not, that al thing without forth that entreth in to a man, may not defoule hym?
24477	41	7	19	for it hath not entrid in to his herte, but in to the wombe, and bynethe it goith out, purgynge alle metis.
24478	41	7	20	But he seide, The thingis that gon out of a man, tho defoulen a man.
24479	41	7	21	For fro with ynne, of the herte of men comen forth yuel thouytis, auowtries,
24480	41	7	22	fornycaciouns, mansleyingis, theftis, auaricis, wickidnessis, gile, vnchastite, yuel iye, blasfemyes, pride, foli.
24481	41	7	23	Alle these yuels comen forth fro with ynne, and defoulen a man.
24482	41	7	24	And Jhesus roos vp fro thennus, and wente in to the coostis of Tyre and of Sidon. And he yede in to an hous, and wolde that no man wiste; and he myyte not be hid.
24483	41	7	25	For a womman, anoon as sche herd of hym, whos douytir hadde an vnclene spirit, entride, and fel doun at hise feet.
24484	41	7	26	And the womman was hethen, of the generacioun of Sirofenyce. And sche preiede hym, that he wolde caste out a deuel fro hir douyter.
24485	41	7	27	And he seide to hir, Suffre thou, that the children be fulfillid first; for it is not good to take the breed of children, and yyue to houndis.
24486	41	7	28	And sche answeride, and seide to him, Yis, Lord; for litil whelpis eten vndur the bord, of the crummes of children.
24487	41	7	29	And Jhesus seide to hir, Go thou, for this word the feend wente out of thi douytir.
24488	41	7	30	And whanne sche was gon in to hir hous home, sche foonde the damysel ligynge on the bed, and the deuel gon out fro hir.
24489	41	7	31	And eftsoones Jhesus yede out fro the coostis of Tire, and cam thorou Sidon to the see of Galilee, bitwixe the myddil of the coostis of Decapoleos.
24490	41	7	32	And thei bryngen to hym a man deef and doumbe, and preieden hym to leye his hoond on hym.
24491	41	7	33	And he took hym asidis fro the puple, and puttide hise fyngris in to hise eris; and he spetide, and touchide his tonge.
24492	41	7	34	And he bihelde in to heuene, and sorewide with ynne, and seide, Effeta, that is, Be thou openyd.
24493	41	7	35	And anoon hise eris weren openyd, and the boond of his tunge was vnboundun, and he spak riytli.
24494	41	7	36	And he comaundide to hem, that thei schulden seie to no man; but hou myche he comaundide to hem, so myche more thei prechiden,
24495	41	7	37	and bi so myche more thei wondriden, and seiden, He dide wel alle thingis, and he made deef men to here, and doumbe men to speke.
24496	41	8	1	In tho daies eft, whanne myche puple was with Jhesu, and hadden not what thei schulden ete, whanne hise disciplis weren clepid togidir,
24497	41	8	2	he seide to hem, I haue reuth on the puple, for lo! now the thridde dai thei abiden me, and han not what to ete;
24498	41	8	3	and if Y leeue hem fastynge in to her hous, thei schulen faile in the weie; for summe of hem camen fro fer.
24499	41	8	4	And hise disciplis answerden to hym, Wherof schal a man mowe fille hem with looues here in wildirnesse?
24500	41	8	5	And he axide hem, Hou many looues han ye?
24501	41	8	6	Whiche seiden, Seuene. And he comaundide the puple to sitte doun on the erthe. And he took the seuene looues, and dide thankyngis, and brak, and yaf to hise disciplis, that thei schulden sette forth. And thei settiden forth to the puple.
24502	41	8	7	And thei hadden a few smale fischis; and he blesside hem, and comaundide, that thei weren sette forth.
24503	41	8	8	And thei eten, and weren fulfillid; and thei token vp that that lefte of relifs, seuene lepis.
24504	41	8	9	And thei that eeten, weren as foure thousynde of men; and he lefte hem.
24505	41	8	10	And anoon he wente vp in to a boot, with hise disciplis, and cam in to the coostis of Dalmamytha.
24506	41	8	11	And the Farisees wenten out, and bigunnen to dispuyte with hym, and axiden a tokne of hym fro heuene, and temptiden hym.
24507	41	8	12	And he sorewynge `with ynne in spirit, seide, What sekith this generacioun a tokne? Treuli Y seie to you, a tokene schal not be youun to this generacioun.
24508	41	8	13	And he lefte hem, and wente vp eftsoone in to a boot, and wente ouer the see.
24509	41	8	14	And thei foryaten to take breed, and thei hadden not with hem but o loof in the boot.
24510	41	8	15	And he comaundide hem, and seide, Se ye, and `be war of the sowre dowy of Farisees, and of the sowrdowy of Eroude.
24511	41	8	16	And thei thouyten, and seiden oon to anothir, For we han not looues.
24512	41	8	17	And whanne this thing was knowun, Jhesus seide to hem, What thenken ye, for ye han not looues? Yit ye knowun not, ne vndurstonden; yit ye han youre herte blyndid.
24513	41	8	18	Ye hauynge iyen, seen not, and ye hauynge eeris, heren not; nethir ye han mynde,

24515	41	8	20	Whanne also seuene looues among foure thousynde of men, hou many lepis of brokun mete tokun ye vp?
24516	41	8	21	And thei seien to hym, Seuene. And he seide to hem, Hou vndurstonden ye not yit?
24517	41	8	22	And thei camen to Bethsaida, and thei bryngen to hym a blynde man, and thei preieden hym, that he schulde touche hym.
24518	41	8	23	And whanne he hadde take the blynde mannus hoond, he ledde hym out of the street, and spete in to hise iyen, and sette hise hoondis on hym; and he axide hym, if he saye ony thing.
24519	41	8	24	And he bihelde, and seide, Y se men as trees walkynge.
24520	41	8	25	Aftirward eftsoones he sette hise hondis on hise iyen, and he bigan to see, and he was restorid, so that he saiy cleerli alle thingis.
24521	41	8	26	And he sente hym in to his hous, and seide, Go in to thin hous; and if thou goist in to the streete, seie to no man.
24522	41	8	27	And Jhesus entride and hise disciplis in to the castels of Cesarye of Philip. And in the weie he axide hise disciplis, and seide to hem, Whom seien men that Y am?

24524	41	8	29	Thanne he seith to hem, But whom seien ye that Y am? Petre answeride, and seide to hym, Thou art Crist.
24525	41	8	30	And he chargide hem, that thei schulden not seie of hym to ony man.
24526	41	8	31	And he bigan to teche hem, that it bihoueth mannus sone to suffre many thingis, and to be repreued of the elder men, and of the hiyest prestis, and the scribis, and to be slayn, and aftir thre dayes, to rise ayen.
24527	41	8	32	And he spak pleynli the word. And Peter took hym, and bigan to blame hym, and seide, Lord, be thou merciful to thee, for this schal not be.
24528	41	8	33	And he turnede, and saiy hise disciplis, and manasside Petir, and seide, Go after me, Satanas; for thou sauerist not tho thingis that ben of God, but tho thingis that ben of men.
24529	41	8	34	And whanne the puple was clepid togidere, with hise disciplis, he seide to hem, If ony man wole come after me, denye he hym silf, and take his cros, and sue he me.
24530	41	8	35	For he that wole make saaf his lijf, schal leese it; and he that leesith his lijf for me, and for the gospel, schal make it saaf.
24531	41	8	36	For what profitith it to a man, if he wynne al the world, and do peiryng to his soule?
24532	41	8	37	or what chaunging schal a man yyue for his soule?
24533	41	8	38	But who that knoulechith me and my wordis in this generacioun avowtresse and synful, also mannus sone schal knouleche him, whanne he schal come in the glorie of his fadir, with his aungels.
24534	41	8	39	And he seide to hem, Treuli Y seie to you, that there ben summen stondynge here, whiche schulen not taste deth, til thei seen the rewme of God comynge in vertu.
24535	41	9	1	And aftir sixe daies Jhesus took Petre, and James, and Joon, and ledde hem bi hem silf aloone in to an hiy hille; and he was transfigurid bifor hem.
24536	41	9	2	And hise clothis weren maad ful schynynge and white as snow, whiche maner white clothis a fuller may not make on erthe.
24537	41	9	3	And Helie with Moises apperide to hem, and thei spaken with Jhesu.
24538	41	9	4	And Petre answeride, and seide to Jhesu, Maister, it is good vs to be here; and make we here thre tabernaclis, oon to thee, oon to Moyses, and oon to Helie.
24539	41	9	5	For he wiste not what he schulde seie; for thei weren agaste bi drede.
24540	41	9	6	And ther was maad a cloude overschadewynge hem; and a vois cam of the cloude, and seide, This is my moost derworth sone, here ye hym.
24541	41	9	7	And anoon thei bihelden aboute, and sayn no more ony man, but Jhesu oonli with hem.
24542	41	9	8	And whanne thei camen doun fro the hille, he comaundide hem, that thei schulden not telle to ony man tho thingis that thei hadden seen, but whanne mannus sone hath risun ayen fro deeth.
24543	41	9	9	And thei helden the word at hem silf, sekynge what this schulde be, whanne he hadde risun ayen fro deth.
24544	41	9	10	And thei axiden hym, and seiden, What thanne seien Farisees and scribis, for it bihoueth `Helie to come first.
24545	41	9	11	And he answeride, and seide to hem, Whanne Helie cometh, he schal first restore alle thingis; and as it is writun of mannus sone, that he suffre many thingis, and be dispisid.
24546	41	9	12	And Y seie to you, that Helie is comun, and thei diden to hym what euer thingis thei wolden, as it is writun of hym.
24547	41	9	13	And he comynge to hise disciplis, saiy a greet cumpany aboute hem, and scribis disputynge with hem.
24548	41	9	14	And anoon al the puple seynge Jhesu, was astonyed, and thei dredden; and thei rennynge gretten hym.
24549	41	9	15	And he axide hem, What disputen ye among you?
24550	41	9	16	And oon of the cumpany answerde, and seide, Mayster, Y haue brouyt to thee my sone, that hath a doumbe spirit; and where euer he takith hym,
24551	41	9	17	he hurtlith hym doun, and he fometh, and betith togidir with teeth, and wexith drye. And Y seide to thi disciplis, that thei schulden caste hym out, and thei myyten not.
24552	41	9	18	And he answeride to hem, and seide, A! thou generacioun out of bileue, hou longe schal Y be among you, hou longe schal Y suffre you? Brynge ye hym to me.
24553	41	9	19	And thei brouyten hym. And whanne he had seyn him, anoon the spirit troublide him; and was throw doun to grounde, and walewide, and fomede.
24554	41	9	20	And he axide his fadir, Hou longe `is it, sith this `hath falle to hym? And he seide, Fro childhode;
24555	41	9	21	and ofte he hath put hym in to fier, and in to watir, to leese hym; but if thou maiste ony thing, helpe vs, and haue merci on vs.
24556	41	9	22	And Jhesus seide to hym, If thou maiste bileue, alle thingis ben possible to man that bileueth.
24557	41	9	23	And anoon the fadir of the child criede with teeris, and seide, Lord, Y bileue; Lord, helpe thou myn vnbileue.
24558	41	9	24	And whanne Jhesus hadde seyn the puple rennynge togidere, he manasside the vnclene spirit, and seide to hym, Thou deef and doumbe spirit, Y comaunde thee, go out fro hym, and entre no more in to hym.
24559	41	9	25	And he criynge, and myche to breidynge him, wente out fro hym; and he was maad as deed, so that many seiden, that he was deed.
24560	41	9	26	And Jhesus helde his hoond, and lifte hym vp; and he roos.
24561	41	9	27	And whanne he hadde entrid in to an hous, hise disciplis axiden hym priueli, Whi myyten not we caste hym out?
24562	41	9	28	And he seide to hem, This kynde in no thing may go out, but in preier and fastyng.
24563	41	9	29	And thei yeden fro thennus, and wente forth in to Galile; and thei wolden not, that ony man wiste.
24564	41	9	30	And he tauyte hise disciplis, and seide to hem, For mannus sone schal be bitrayed in to the hondis of men, and thei schulen sle hym, and he slayn schal ryse ayen on the thridde day.
24565	41	9	31	And thei knewen not the word, and dredden to axe hym.
24566	41	9	32	And thei camen to Cafarnaum. And whanne thei weren in the hous, he axide hem, What tretiden ye in the weie?
24567	41	9	33	And thei weren stille; for thei disputiden among hem in the weie, who of hem schulde be grettest.
24568	41	9	34	And he sat, and clepide the twelue, and seide to hem, If ony man wole be the firste among you, he schal be the laste of alle, and the mynyster of alle.
24569	41	9	35	And he took a child, and sette hym in the myddil of hem; and whanne he hadde biclippid hym, he seide to hem,
24570	41	9	36	Who euer resseyueth oon of such children in my name, he resseyueth me; and who euer resseyueth me, he resseyueth not me aloone, but hym that sente me.
24571	41	9	37	Joon answeride to hym, and seide, Maister, we sayn oon castynge out feendis in thi name, which sueth not vs, and we han forbodun hym.
24572	41	9	38	And Jhesus seide, Nyle ye forbede him; for ther is no man that doith vertu in my name, and may soone speke yuel of me.
24573	41	9	39	He that is not ayens vs, is for vs.
24574	41	9	40	And who euer yyueth you a cuppe of coold water to drynke in my name, for ye ben of Crist, treuli Y seie to you, he schal not leese his mede.
24575	41	9	41	And who euer schal sclaundre oon of these litle that bileuen in me, it were betere to hym that a mylne stoon `of assis were don aboute his necke, and he were cast in to the see.
24576	41	9	42	And if thin hoond sclaundre thee, kitte it awey; it is betere to thee to entre feble in to lijf, than haue two hondis, and go in to helle, in to fier that neuer schal be quenchid,
24577	41	9	43	where the worm of hem dieth not, and the fier is not quenchid.
24578	41	9	44	And if thi foote sclaundre thee, kitte it of; it is betere to thee to entre crokid in to euerlastynge lijf, than haue twei feet, and be sent in to helle of fier, that neuer schal be quenchid,
24579	41	9	45	where the worme of hem dieth not, and the fier is not quenchid.
24580	41	9	46	That if thin iye sclaundre thee, cast it out; it is betere to thee to entre gogil iyed in to the reume of God, than haue twey iyen, and be sent in to helle of fier, where the worme of hem dieth not,
24581	41	9	47	and the fier is not quenchid.
24582	41	9	48	And euery man schal be saltid with fier, and euery slayn sacrifice schal be maad sauery with salt.
24583	41	9	49	Salt is good; if salt be vnsauery, in what thing schulen ye make it sauery? Haue ye salt among you, and haue ye pees among you.
24584	41	10	1	And Jhesus roos vp fro thennus, and cam in to the coostis of Judee ouer Jordan; and eftsoones the puple cam togidere to hym, and as he was wont, eftsoone he tauyte hem.
24585	41	10	2	And the Farisees camen, and axiden hym, Whether it be leueful to a man to leeue his wijf? and thei temptiden hym.
24586	41	10	3	And he answeride, and seide to hem, What comaundide Moises to you?
24587	41	10	4	And thei seiden, Moises suffride to write a libel of forsaking, and to forsake.
24588	41	10	5	`To whiche Jhesus answeride, and seide, For the hardnesse of youre herte Moises wroot to you this comaundement.
24589	41	10	6	But fro the bigynnyng of creature God made hem male and female;
24590	41	10	7	and seide, For this thing a man schal leeue his fadir and modir,
24591	41	10	8	and schal drawe to hys wijf, and thei schulen be tweyne in o flesch. And so now thei ben not tweyne, but o flesch.
24592	41	10	9	Therfor that thing that God ioynede togidere, no man departe.
24593	41	10	10	And eftsoone in the hous hise disciplis axiden hym of the same thing.
24594	41	10	11	And he seide to hem, Who euer leeuith his wijf, and weddith another, he doith auowtri on hir.
24595	41	10	12	And if the wijf leeue hir housebonde, and be weddid to another man, sche doith letcherie.
24596	41	10	13	And thei brouyten to hym litle children, that he schulde touche hem; and the disciplis threteneden the men, that brouyten hem.
24597	41	10	14	And whanne Jhesus hadde seyn hem, he baar heuy, and seide to hem, Suffre ye litle children to come to me, and forbede ye hem not, for of suche is the kyngdom of God.
24598	41	10	15	Treuli Y seie to you, who euer resseyueth not the kyngdom of God as a litil child, he schal not entre in to it.
24599	41	10	16	And he biclippide hem, and leide hise hondis on hem, and blisside hem.
24600	41	10	17	And whanne Jhesus was gon out in the weie, a man ranne bifore, and knelide bifor hym, and preiede hym, and seide, Good maister, what schal Y do, that Y resseyue euerlastynge lijf?
24601	41	10	18	And Jhesus seide to hym, What seist thou, that Y am good? Ther is no man good, but God hym silf.
24602	41	10	19	Thou knowist the comaundementis, do thou noon auowtrie, `sle not, stele not, seie not fals witnessyng, do no fraude, worschipe thi fadir and thi modir.
24603	41	10	20	And he answeride, and seide to hym, Maister, Y haue kept alle these thingis fro my yongthe.
24604	41	10	21	And Jhesus bihelde hym, and louede hym, and seide to hym, O thing faileth to thee; go thou, and sille alle thingis that thou hast, and yyue to pore men, and thou schalt haue tresoure in heuene; and come, sue thou me.
24605	41	10	22	And he was ful sori in the word, and wente awei mornyng, for he hadde many possessiouns.
24606	41	10	23	And Jhesus bihelde aboute, and seide to hise disciplis, Hou hard thei that han ritchessis schulen entre in to the kyngdom of God.
24607	41	10	24	And the disciplis weren astonyed in hise wordis. And Jhesus eftsoone answeride, and seide `to hem, Ye litle children, hou hard it is for men that tristen in ritchessis to entre in to the kyngdom of God.
24608	41	10	25	It is liyter a camele to passe thorou a nedlis iye, than a riche man to entre in to the kyngdom of God.
24609	41	10	26	And thei wondriden more, and seiden among hem silf, And who may be sauyd?
24610	41	10	27	And Jhesus bihelde hem, and seide, Anentis men it is impossible, but not anentis God; for alle thingis ben possible anentis God.
24611	41	10	28	And Petir bigan to seie to hym, Lo! we han left alle thingis, and han sued thee.
24612	41	10	29	Jhesus answeride, and seide, Treuli Y seie to you, ther is no man that leeueth hous, or britheren, or sistris, or fadir, or modir, or children, or feeldis for me and for the gospel,
24613	41	10	30	which schal not take an hundrid fold so myche now in this tyme, housis, and britheren, and sistris, and modris, and children, and feeldis, with persecuciouns, and in the world to comynge euerlastynge lijf.
24614	41	10	31	But many schulen be, the firste the last, and the last the firste.
24615	41	10	32	And thei weren in the weie goynge vp to Jerusalem; and Jhesus wente bifor hem, and thei wondriden, and foleweden, and dredden. And eftsoone Jhesus took the twelue, and bigan to seie to hem, what thingis weren to come to hym.
24616	41	10	33	For lo! we stien to Jerusalem, and mannus sone schal be bitraied to the princis of prestis, and to scribis, and to the eldre men; and thei schulen dampne hym bi deth, and thei schulen take hym to hethene men. And thei schulen scorne hym,
24617	41	10	34	and bispete hym, and bete him; and thei schulen sle hym, and in the thridde dai he schal rise ayen.
24618	41	10	35	And James and Joon, Zebedees sones, camen to hym, and seiden, Maister, we wolen, that what euer we axen, thou do to vs.
24619	41	10	36	And he seide to hem, What wolen ye that Y do to you?
24620	41	10	37	And thei seiden, Graunte to vs, that we sitten `the toon at thi riythalf, and the tother at thi left half, in thi glorie.
24621	41	10	38	And Jhesus seide to hem, Ye witen not what ye axen; moun ye drynke the cuppe, which Y schal drynke, or be waischun with the baptym, in which Y am baptisid?
24622	41	10	39	And thei seiden to hym, We moun. And Jhesus seide to hem, Ye schulen drynke the cuppe that Y drynke, and ye schulen be waschun with the baptym, in which Y am baptisid;
24623	41	10	40	but to sitte at my riythalf or lefthalf is not myn to yyue to you, but to whiche it is maad redi.
24624	41	10	41	And the ten herden, and bigunnen to haue indignacioun of James and Joon.
24625	41	10	42	But Jhesus clepide hem, and seide to hem, Ye witen, that thei that semen to haue prynshode of folkis, ben lordis of hem, and the princes of hem han power of hem.
24626	41	10	43	But it is not so among you, but who euer wole be maad gretter, schal be youre mynyster;
24627	41	10	44	and who euer wole be the firste among you, schal be seruaunt of alle.
24628	41	10	45	For whi mannus sone cam not, that it schulde be mynystrid to hym, but that he schulde mynystre, and yyue his lijf ayenbiyng for manye.
24629	41	10	46	And thei camen to Jerico; and whanne he yede forth fro Jerico, and hise disciplis, and a ful myche puple, Barthymeus, a blynde man, the sone of Thimei, sat bisidis the weie, and beggide.
24630	41	10	47	And whanne he herde, that it is Jhesus of Nazareth, he bigan to crie, and seie, Jhesu, the sone of Dauid, haue merci on me.
24631	41	10	48	And manye thretneden hym, that he schulde be stille; and he criede myche the more, Jhesu, the sone of Dauid, haue merci on me.
24632	41	10	49	And Jhesus stood, and comaundide hym to be clepid; and thei clepen the blynde man, and seien to hym, Be thou of betere herte, rise vp, he clepith thee.
24633	41	10	50	And he castide awei his cloth, and skippide, and cam to hym.
24634	41	10	51	And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hym, What wolt thou, that Y schal do to thee? The blynde man seide to hym, Maister, that Y se.
24635	41	10	52	Jhesus seide to hym, Go thou, thi feith hath maad thee saaf. And anoon he saye, and suede hym in the weie.
24636	41	11	1	And whanne Jhesus cam nyy to Jerusalem and to Betanye, to the mount of Olyues, he sendith tweyne of hise disciplis, and seith to hem,
24637	41	11	2	Go ye in to the castel that is ayens you; and anoon as ye entren there ye schulen fynde a colt tied, on which no man hath sete yit; vntie ye, and brynge hym.
24638	41	11	3	And if ony man seye ony thing to you, What doen ye? seie ye, that he is nedeful to the Lord, and anoon he schal leeue hym hidir.
24639	41	11	4	And thei yeden forth, and founden a colt tied bifor the yate with out forth, in the metyng of twei weies; and thei vntieden hym.
24640	41	11	5	And summe of hem that stoden there seiden to hem, What doen ye, vntiynge the colt?
24641	41	11	6	And thei seiden to hem, as Jhesus comaundide hem; and thei leften it to hem.
24642	41	11	7	And thei brouyten the colt to Jhesu, and thei leiden on hym her clothis, and Jhesus sat on hym.
24643	41	11	8	And many strewiden her clothis in the weie, othere men kittiden braunchis fro trees, and strewiden in the weie.
24644	41	11	9	And thei that wenten bifor, and that sueden, crieden, and seiden, Osanna,
24645	41	11	10	blissid is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; blessid be the kyngdom of oure fadir Dauid that is come; Osanna in hiyest thingis.
24646	41	11	11	And he entride in to Jerusalem, in to the temple; and whanne he `hadde seyn al thing aboute, whanne it was eue, he wente out in to Betanye, with the twelue.
24647	41	11	12	And anothir daye, whanne he wente out of Betanye, he hungride.
24648	41	11	13	And whanne he hadde seyn a fige tree afer hauynge leeues, he cam, if happili he schulde fynde ony thing theron; and whanne he cam to it, he foonde no thing, out takun leeues; for it was not tyme of figis.
24649	41	11	14	And Jhesus answeride and seide to it, Now neuer ete ony man fruyt of thee more. And hise disciplis herden;
24650	41	11	15	and thei camen to Jerusalem. And whanne he was entrid in to the temple, he bigan to caste out silleris and biggeris in the temple; and he turnede vpsodoun the bordis of chaungeris, and the chayeris of men that selden culueris;
24651	41	11	16	and he suffride not, that ony man schulde bere a vessel thorou the temple.
24652	41	11	17	And he tauyte hem, and seide, Whether it is not writun, That myn hous schal be clepid the hous of preyng to alle folkis? but ye han maad it a denne of theues.
24653	41	11	18	And whanne this thing was herd, the princis of prestis and scribis souyten hou thei schulden leese hym; for thei dredden hym, for al the puple wondride on his techyng.
24654	41	11	19	And whanne euenyng was come, he wente out of the citee.
24655	41	11	20	And as thei passiden forth eerli, thei sayn the fige tree maad drye fro the rootis.
24656	41	11	21	And Petir bithouyte hym, and seide to hym, Maister, lo! the fige tree, whom thou cursidist, is dried vp.
24657	41	11	22	And Jhesus answeride and seide to hem, Haue ye the feith of God;
24658	41	11	23	treuli Y seie to you, that who euer seith to this hil, Be thou takun, and cast in to the see; and doute not in his herte, but bileueth, that what euer he seie, schal be don, it schal be don to hym.
24659	41	11	24	Therfor Y seie to you, alle thingis what euer thingis ye preynge schulen axe, bileue ye that ye schulen take, and thei schulen come to you.
24660	41	11	25	And whanne ye schulen stonde to preye, foryyue ye, if ye han ony thing ayens ony man, that youre fadir that is in heuenes, foryyue to you youre synnes.
24661	41	11	26	And if ye foryyuen not, nether youre fadir that is in heuenes, schal foryyue to you youre synnes.
24662	41	11	27	And eftsoone thei camen to Jerusalem. And whanne he walkide in the temple, the hiyeste prestis, and scribis, and the elder men camen to hym,
24663	41	11	28	and seyn to hym, In what power doist thou these thingis? or who yaf to thee this power, that thou do these thingis?
24664	41	11	29	Jhesus answeride and seide to hem, And Y schal axe you o word, and answere ye to me, and Y schal seie to you in what power Y do these thingis.
24665	41	11	30	Whether was the baptym of Joon of heuene, or of men? answere ye to me.
24666	41	11	31	And thei thouyten with ynne hem silf, seiynge, If we seien of heuene, he schal seie to vs, Whi thanne bileuen ye not to him;
24667	41	11	32	if we seien of men, we dreden the puple; for alle men hadden Joon, that he was verili a prophete.
24668	41	11	33	And thei answeryden, and seien to Jhesu, We witen neuer. And Jhesu answerde, and seide to hem, Nether Y seie to you, in what power Y do these thingis.
24669	41	12	1	And Jhesus bigan to speke to hem in parablis. A man plauntide a vynyerd, and sette an hegge aboute it, and dalf a lake, and bildide a toure, and hiryde it to tilieris, and wente forth in pilgrimage.
24670	41	12	2	And he sente to the erthe tilieris in tyme a seruaunt, to resseyue of the erthe tilieris of the fruyt of the vynyerd.
24671	41	12	3	And thei token hym, and beeten, and leften hym voide.
24672	41	12	4	And eftsoone he sente to hem anothir seruaunt, and thei woundiden hym in the heed, and turmentiden hym.
24673	41	12	5	And eftsoone he sente another, and thei slowen hym, and othir mo, betynge summe, and sleynge othere.
24674	41	12	6	But yit he hadde a moost derworth sone, and he sente hym last to hem, and seide, Perauenture thei schulen drede my sone.
24675	41	12	7	But the erthetilieris seiden togidere, This is the eire; come ye, sle we hym, and the eritage schal be ourun.
24676	41	12	8	And thei tokun hym, and killiden, and castiden out without the vynyerd.
24677	41	12	9	Thanne what schal the lord of the vynyerd do? He schal come, and lese the tilieris, and yyue the vynyerd to othere.
24678	41	12	10	Whether ye han not red this scripture, The stoon which the bilderis han disspisid, this is maad in to the heed of the corner?
24679	41	12	11	This thing is doon of the Lord, and is wondirful in oure iyen.
24680	41	12	12	And thei souyten to holde hym, and thei dredden the puple; for thei knewen that to hem he seide this parable; and thei leften hym,
24681	41	12	13	and thei wenten awei. And thei senten to hym summe of the Farisees and Erodians, to take hym in word.
24682	41	12	14	Whiche camen, and seien to hym, Maistir, we witen that thou art sothfast, and reckist not of ony man; for nethir thou biholdist in to the face of man, but thou techist the weie of God in treuthe. Is it leeueful that tribute be youun to the emperoure, or we schulen not yyue?
24683	41	12	15	Which witynge her pryuei falsnesse, seide to hem, What tempten ye me? brynge ye to me a peny, that Y se.
24684	41	12	16	And thei brouyten to hym. And he seide to hem, Whos is this ymage, and the writyng? Thei seien to him, The emperouris.
24685	41	12	17	And Jhesus answeride and seide to hem, Thanne yelde ye to the emperour tho thingis that ben of the emperours; and to God tho thingis that ben of God.
24686	41	12	18	And thei wondriden of hym. And Saduces, that seien that ther is no ressurreccioun, camen to hym, and axeden hym,
24687	41	12	19	and seiden, Maister, Moyses wroot to vs, that if the brother of a man were deed, and lefte his wijf, and haue no sones, his brother take his wijf, and reise vp seed to his brother.
24688	41	12	20	Thanne seuene britheren ther weren; and the firste took a wijf, and diede, and lefte no seed.
24689	41	12	21	And the secounde took hir, and he diede, and nether this lefte seed.
24690	41	12	22	And the thridde also. And in lijk manere the seuene token hir, and leften not seed. And the womman the laste of alle `is deed.
24691	41	12	23	Thanne in the resurreccioun, whanne thei schulen rise ayen, whos wijf of these schal sche be? for seuene hadden hir to wijf.
24692	41	12	24	And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hem, Whether ye erren not therfor, that ye knowe not scripturis, nethir the vertu of God?
24693	41	12	25	For whanne thei schulen rise ayen fro deeth, nether thei schulen wedde, nethir schulen be weddid, but thei schulen be as aungels of God in heuenes.
24694	41	12	26	And of deed men, that thei risen ayen, han ye not red in the book of Moises, on the buysch, hou God spak to hym, and seide, Y am God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob?
24695	41	12	27	He is not God of deed men, but of lyuynge men; therfor ye erren myche.
24696	41	12	28	And oon of the scribis, that hadde herde hem dispuytynge togidir, cam nyy, and saiy that Jhesus had wel answeride hem, and axide hym, which was the firste maundement of alle.
24697	41	12	29	And Jhesus answeride to him, that the firste maundement of alle is, Here thou, Israel, thi Lord God is o God;
24698	41	12	30	and thou schalt loue thi Lord God of al thin herte, and of al thi soule, and of al thi mynde, and of al thi myyt.
24699	41	12	31	This is the firste maundement. And the secounde is lijk to this, Thou schalt loue thi neiybore as thi silf. Ther is noon other maundement gretter than these.
24700	41	12	32	And the scribe seide to hym, Maister, in treuthe thou hast wel seid; for o God is, and ther is noon other, outakun hym;
24701	41	12	33	that he be loued of al the herte, and of al the mynde, and of al the vndurstondynge, and of al the soule, and of al strengthe, and to loue the neiybore as hym silf, is gretter than alle brent offryngis and sacrifices.
24702	41	12	34	And Jhesus seynge that he hadde answerid wiseli, seide to hym, Thou art not fer fro the kyngdom of God.
24703	41	12	35	And thanne no man durste axe hym no more ony thing. And Jhesus answeride and seide, techynge in the temple, Hou seien scribis, that Crist is the sone of Dauid?
24704	41	12	36	For Dauid hym silf seide in the Hooli Goost, the Lord seide to my lord, Sitte on my riythalf, til Y putte thin enemyes the stool of thi feet.
24705	41	12	37	Thanne Dauid hym silf clepith him lord, hou thanne is he his sone? And myche puple gladli herde hym.
24706	41	12	38	And he seide to hem in his techyng, Be ye war of scribis, that wolen wandre in stolis,
24707	41	12	39	and be salutid in chepyng, and sitte in synagogis in the firste chaieris, and the firste sittyng placis in soperis;
24708	41	12	40	whiche deuouren the housis of widewis vndur colour of long preier; thei schulen take the longer doom.
24709	41	12	41	And Jhesus sittynge ayens the tresorie, bihelde hou the puple castide monei in to the tresorie; and many riche men castiden many thingis.
24710	41	12	42	But whanne a pore widewe was comun, sche keste two mynutis, that is, a ferthing.
24711	41	12	43	And he clepide togidere hise disciplis, and seide to hem, Treuli Y seie to you, that this pore widewe keste more thanne alle, that kesten in to the tresorie.
24712	41	12	44	For alle kesten of that thing that thei hadden plente of; but this of her pouert keste alle thingis that sche hadde, al hir lyuelode.
24713	41	13	1	And whanne he wente out of the temple, oon of hise disciplis seide to hym, Maister, biholde, what maner stoonys, and what maner bildyngis.
24714	41	13	2	And Jhesu answeride, and seide to hym, Seest thou alle these grete bildingis? ther schal not be left a stoon on a stoon, which schal not be distried.
24715	41	13	3	And whanne he sat in the mount of Olyues ayens the temple, Petir and James and Joon and Andrew axiden hym bi hem silf,
24716	41	13	4	Seie thou to vs, whanne these thingis schulen be don, and what tokene schal be, whanne alle these thingis schulen bigynne to be endid.
24717	41	13	5	And Jhesus answeride, and bigan to seie to hem, Loke ye, that no man disseyue you;
24718	41	13	6	for manye schulen come in my name, seiynge, That Y am; and thei schulen disseyue manye.
24719	41	13	7	And whanne ye here batels and opynyouns of batels, drede ye not; for it bihoueth these thingis to be doon, but not yit anoon is the ende.
24720	41	13	8	For folk schal rise on folk, and rewme on rewme, and erthe mouyngis and hungur schulen be bi placis; these thingis schulen be bigynnyngis of sorewis.
24721	41	13	9	But se ye you silf, for thei schulen take you in counsels, and ye schulen be betun in synagogis; and ye schulen stonde bifor kyngis and domesmen for me, in witnessyng to hem.
24722	41	13	10	And it bihoueth, that the gospel be first prechid among al folk.
24723	41	13	11	And whanne thei taken you, and leden you forth, nyle ye bifore thenke what ye schulen speke, but speke ye that thing that schal be youun to you in that our; for ye ben not the spekeris, but the Hooli Goost.
24724	41	13	12	For a brother schal bitake the brother in to deth, and the fadir the sone, and sones schulen rise togider ayens fadris and modris, and punysche hem bi deeth.
24725	41	13	13	And ye schulen be in hate to alle men for my name; but he that lastith in to the ende, schal be saaf.
24726	41	13	14	But whanne ye schulen se the abhomynacioun of discoumfort, stondynge where it owith not; he that redith, vndurstonde; thanne thei that be in Judee, fle `in to hillis.
24727	41	13	15	And he that is aboue the roof, come not doun in to the hous, nethir entre he, to take ony thing of his hous;
24728	41	13	16	and he that schal be in the feeld, turne not ayen bihynde to take his cloth.
24729	41	13	17	But wo to hem that ben with child, and norischen in tho daies.
24730	41	13	18	Therfor preye ye, that thei be not don in wyntir.
24731	41	13	19	But thilke daies of tribulacioun schulen be suche, whiche maner weren not fro the bigynnyng of creature, which God hath maad, til now, nethir schulen be.
24732	41	13	20	And but the Lord hadde abredgide tho daies, al fleische hadde not be saaf; but for the chosun whiche he chees, the Lord hath maad schort the daies.
24733	41	13	21	And thanne if ony man seie to you, Lo! here is Crist, lo! there, bileue ye not.
24734	41	13	22	For false Cristis and false prophetis schulen rise, and schulen yyue tokenes and wondris, to disseyue, if it may be don, yhe, hem that be chosun.
24735	41	13	23	Therfor take ye kepe; lo! Y haue bifor seid to you alle thingis.
24736	41	13	24	But in tho daies, aftir that tribulacioun, the sunne schal be maad derk, and the moon schal not yyue hir liyt,
24737	41	13	25	and the sterris of heuene schulen falle doun, and the vertues that ben in heuenes, schulen be moued.
24738	41	13	26	And thanne thei schulen se mannus sone comynge in cloudis of heuene, with greet vertu and glorie.
24739	41	13	27	And thanne he schal sende hise aungelis, and schal geder hise chosun fro the foure wyndis, fro the hiyest thing of erthe til to the hiyest thing of heuene.
24740	41	13	28	But of the fige tree lerne ye the parable. Whanne now his braunche is tendre, and leeues ben sprongun out, ye knowen that somer is nyy.
24741	41	13	29	So whanne ye seen these thingis be don, wite ye, that it is nyy in the doris.
24742	41	13	30	Treuli Y seie to you, that this generacioun schal not passe awei, til alle these thingis be don.
24743	41	13	31	Heuene and erthe schulen passe, but my wordis schulen not passe.
24744	41	13	32	But of that dai or our no man woot, nether aungels in heuene, nether the sone, but the fadir.
24745	41	13	33	Se ye, wake ye, and preie ye; for ye witen not, whanne the tyme is.
24746	41	13	34	For as a man that is gon fer in pilgrimage, lefte his hous, and yaf to his seruauntis power of euery work, and comaundide to the porter, that he wake.
24747	41	13	35	Therfor wake ye, for ye witen not, whanne the lord of the hous cometh, in the euentide, or at mydnyyt, or at cockis crowyng, or in the mornyng;
24748	41	13	36	leste whanne he cometh sodenli, he fynde you slepynge.
24749	41	13	37	Forsothe that that Y seie to you, Y seie to alle, Wake ye.
24750	41	14	1	Pask and the feest of therf looues was after twei daies. And the hiyest preestis and scribis souyten, hou thei schulden holde hym with gile, and sle.
24751	41	14	2	But thei seiden, Not in the feeste dai, lest perauenture a noyse were maad among the puple.
24752	41	14	3	And whanne he was at Betanye, in the hous of Symount leprous, and restide, a womman cam, that hadde a boxe of alabastre of precious oynement spikenard; and whanne the boxe of alabastre was brokun, sche helde it on his heed.
24753	41	14	4	But there weren summe that beren it heuyli with ynne hem silf, and seiden, Wher to is this losse of oynement maad?
24754	41	14	5	For this oynement myyte haue be seld more than for thre hundrid pens, and be youun to pore men. And thei groyneden ayens hir.
24755	41	14	6	But Jhesus seide, Suffre ye hir; what be ye heuy to hir? sche hath wrouyt a good werk in me.
24756	41	14	7	For euermore ye schulen haue pore men with you, and whanne ye wolen, ye moun do wel to hem; but ye schulen not euer more haue me.
24757	41	14	8	Sche dide that that sche hadde; sche cam bifore to anoynte my bodi in to biriyng.
24758	41	14	9	Treuli Y seie to you, where euer this gospel be prechid in al the world, and that that `this womman hath don, schal be told in to mynde of hym.
24759	41	14	10	And Judas Scarioth, oon of the twelue, wente to the hiyest prestis, to bitraye hym to hem.
24760	41	14	11	And thei herden, and ioyeden, and bihiyten to yyue hym money. And he souyt hou he schulde bitraye hym couenabli.
24761	41	14	12	And the firste dai of therf looues, whanne thei offriden pask, the disciplis seyn to hym, Whidir `wilt thou that we go, and make redi to thee, that thou ete the pask?
24762	41	14	13	And he sendith tweyn of hise disciplis, and seith to hem, Go ye in to the citee, and a man berynge a galoun of watir schal meete you; sue ye hym.
24763	41	14	14	And whidur euer he entrith, seie ye to the lord of the hous, That the maister seith, Where is myn etynge place, where Y schal ete pask with my disciplis?
24764	41	14	15	And he schal schewe to you a grete soupyng place arayed, and there make ye redi to vs.
24765	41	14	16	And hise disciplis wenten forth, and camen in to the citee, and founden as he hadde seid to hem; and thei maden redy the pask.
24766	41	14	17	And whanne the euentid was come, he cam with the twelue.
24767	41	14	18	And whanne thei saten `at the mete, and eeten, Jhesus seide, Treuli Y seie to you, that oon of you that etith with me, schal bitray me.
24768	41	14	19	And thei bigunnen to be sori, and to seie to hym, ech bi hem silf, Whether Y?
24769	41	14	20	Which seide to hem, Oon of twelue that puttith the hoond with me in the platere.
24770	41	14	21	And sotheli mannus sone goith, as it is writun of hym; but wo to that man, by whom mannus sone schal be bitrayed. It were good to hym, yf thilke man hadde not be borun.
24771	41	14	22	And while thei eeten, Jhesus took breed, and blessid, and brak, and yaf to hem, and seide, Take ye; this is my bodi.
24772	41	14	23	And whanne he hadde take the cuppe, he dide thankyngis, and yaf to hem, and alle dronken therof.
24773	41	14	24	And he seide to hem, This is my blood of the newe testament, which schal be sched for many.
24774	41	14	25	Treuli Y seye to you, for now Y schal not drynke of this fruyt of vyne, in to that dai whane Y schal drynke it newe in the rewme of God.
24775	41	14	26	And whanne the ympne was seid, thei wenten out in to the hil of Olyues.
24776	41	14	27	And Jhesus seide to hem, Alle ye schulen be sclaundrid in me in this nyyt; for it is writun, Y schal smyte the scheepherde, and the scheep of the flok schulen be disparplid.
24777	41	14	28	But aftir that Y schal rise ayen, Y schal go bifor you in to Galilee.
24778	41	14	29	And Petir seide to hym, Thouy alle schulen be sclaundrid, but not Y.
24779	41	14	30	And Jhesus seide to hym, Treuli Y seie to thee, that to dai bifore that the cok in this niyt crowe twies, thou schalt thries denye me.
24780	41	14	31	But he seide more, Thouy it bihoueth, that Y die togider with thee, Y schal not forsake thee. And in lijk maner alle seiden.
24781	41	14	32	And thei camen in to a place, whos name is Gethsamany. And he seide to hise disciplis, Sitte ye here, while Y preye.
24782	41	14	33	And he took Petir and James and Joon with hym, and bigan to drede, and to be anoyed.
24783	41	14	34	And he seide to hem, My soule is soreweful to the deeth; abide ye here, and wake ye with me.
24784	41	14	35	And whanne he was gon forth a litil, he felde doun on the erthe, and preiede, that if it myyte be, that the our schulde passe fro hym.
24785	41	14	36	And he seide, Abba, fadir, alle thingis ben possible to thee, bere ouer fro me this cuppe; but not that Y wole, but that thou wolt, be don.
24786	41	14	37	And he cam, and foond hem slepynge. And he seide to Petir, Symount, slepist thou? myytist thou not wake with me oon our?
24787	41	14	38	Wake ye, and `preie ye, that ye entre not in to temptacioun; for the spirit is redi, but the fleische is sijk.
24788	41	14	39	And eftsoone he yede, and preiede, and seide the same word;
24789	41	14	40	and turnede ayen eftsoone, and foond hem slepynge; for her iyen weren heuyed. And thei knewen not, what thei schulden answere to hym.
24790	41	14	41	And he cam the thridde tyme, and seide to hem, Slepe ye now, and reste ye; it suffisith. The hour is comun; lo! mannus sone schal be bitraied in to the hondis of synful men.
24791	41	14	42	Rise ye, go we; lo! he that schal bitraye me is nyy.
24792	41	14	43	And yit while he spak, Judas Scarioth, oon of the twelue, cam, and with him miche puple with swerdis and staues, sent fro the hiyest prestis, and the scribis, and fro the eldre men.
24793	41	14	44	And his traytour hadde youun to hem a tokene, and seide, Whom euer Y kisse, he it is; holde ye hym, and lede ye warli.
24794	41	14	45	And whanne he cam, anoon he came to hym, and seide, Maistir; and he kisside hym.
24795	41	14	46	And thei leiden hondis on hym, and helden hym.
24796	41	14	47	But oon of the men that stoden aboute, drowy out a swerd, and smoot the seruaunt of the hiyest preest, and kittide of his eere.
24797	41	14	48	And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hem, As to a theef ye han gon out with swerdis and staues, to take me?
24798	41	14	49	Dai bi dai Y was among you, and tauyte in the temple, and ye helden not me; but that the scripturis be fulfillid.
24799	41	14	50	Thanne alle hise disciplis forsoken hym, and fledden.
24800	41	14	51	But a yong man, clothid with lynnun cloth on the bare, suede hym; and thei helden hym.
24801	41	14	52	And he lefte the lynnyn clothing, and fleiy nakid awei fro hem.
24802	41	14	53	And thei ledden Jhesu to the hiyest preest. And alle the prestis and scribis and eldere men camen togidir.
24803	41	14	54	But Petir suede hym afer in to the halle of the hiyest preest. And he sat with the mynystris, and warmede hym at the fier.
24804	41	14	55	And the hiyest prestis, and al the counsel, souyten witnessyng ayens Jhesu to take hym to the deeth; but thei founden not.
24805	41	14	56	For manye seiden fals witnessyng ayens hym, and the witnessyngis weren not couenable.
24806	41	14	57	And summe risen vp, and baren fals witnessyng ayens hym,
24807	41	14	58	and seiden, For we `han herd hym seiynge, Y schal vndo this temple maad with hondis, and aftir the thridde dai Y schal bilde another not maad with hondis.
24808	41	14	59	And the witnessyng `of hem was not couenable.
24809	41	14	60	And the hiyest prest roos vp in to the myddil, and axide Jhesu, and seide, Answerist thou no thing to tho thingis that ben put ayens thee of these?
24810	41	14	61	But he was stille, and answeride no thing. Eftsoone the hiyest prest axide hym, and seide to hym, Art thou Crist, the sone of the blessid God?
24811	41	14	62	And Jhesus seide to hym, Y am; and ye schulen se mannus sone sittynge on the riythalf of the vertu of God, and comynge in the cloudis of heuene.
24812	41	14	63	And the hiyest preest torente hise clothis, and seide, What yit dissiren we witnessis?
24813	41	14	64	Ye han herd blasfemye. What semeth to you? And thei alle condempneden hym to be gilti of deeth.
24814	41	14	65	And summe bigunnen to bispete hym, `and to hile his face, and to smite hym with buffetis, and seie to hym, Areede thou. And the mynystris beeten hym with strokis.
24815	41	14	66	And whanne Petir was in the halle bynethen, oon of the damesels of the hiyest prest cam.
24816	41	14	67	And whanne sche hadde seyn Petir warmynge hym, sche bihelde hym, and seide, And thou were with Jhesu of Nazareth.
24817	41	14	68	And he denyede, and seide, Nethir Y woot, nethir Y knowe, what thou seist. And he wente without forth bifor the halle; and anoon the cok crewe.
24818	41	14	69	And eftsoone whanne another damesel hadde seyn hym, sche bigan to seye to men that stoden aboute, That this is of hem.
24819	41	14	70	And he eftsoone denyede. And aftir a litil, eftsoone thei that stoden nyy, seiden to Petir, Verili thou art of hem, for thou art of Galilee also.
24820	41	14	71	But he bigan to curse and to swere, For Y knowe not this man, whom ye seien.
24821	41	14	72	And anoon eftsoones the cok crew. And Petir bithouyte on the word that Jhesus hadde seide to hym, Bifor the cok crowe twies, thries thou schalt denye me. And he bigan to wepe.
24822	41	15	1	And anoon in the morewtid the hiyeste prestis maden a counsel with the elder men, and the scribis, and with al the counsel, and bounden Jhesu and ledden, and bitoken hym to Pilat.
24823	41	15	2	And Pilat axide hym, Art thou kynge of Jewis? And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hym, Thou seist.
24824	41	15	3	And the hieste prestis accusiden hym in many thingis.
24825	41	15	4	But Pilat eftsoone axide hym, and seide, Answerist thou no thing? Seest thou in hou many thingis thei accusen thee?
24826	41	15	5	But Jhesus answeride no more, so that Pilat wondride.
24827	41	15	6	But bi the feeste dai he was wont to leeue to hem oon of men boundun, whom euer thei axiden.
24828	41	15	7	And `oon ther was that was seid Barabas, that was boundun with men of dissencioun, that hadden don manslauytir in seducioun.
24829	41	15	8	And whanne the puple was gon vp, he bigan to preie, as he euer more dide to hem.
24830	41	15	9	And Pilat answeride `to hem, and seide, Wolen ye Y leeue to you the kyng of Jewis?
24831	41	15	10	For he wiste, that the hiyeste prestis hadden takun hym bi enuye.
24832	41	15	11	But the bischopis stireden the puple, that he schulde rather leeue to hem Barabas.
24833	41	15	12	And eftsoone Pilat answerde, and seide to hem, What thanne wolen ye that Y schal do to the kyng of Jewis?
24834	41	15	13	And thei eftsoone crieden, Crucifie hym.
24835	41	15	14	But Pilat seide to hem, What yuel hath he don? And thei crieden the more, Crucifie hym.
24836	41	15	15	And Pilat, willynge to make aseeth to the puple, lefte to hem Barabas, and bitok to hem Jhesu, betun with scourgis, to be crucified.
24837	41	15	16	And knyytis ledden hym with ynneforth, in to the porche of the mote halle. And thei clepiden togidir al the cumpany of knyytis,
24838	41	15	17	and clothiden hym with purpur. And thei writhen a coroun of thornes, and puttiden on hym.
24839	41	15	18	And thei bigunnen to grete hym, and seiden, Heile, thou kyng of Jewis.
24840	41	15	19	And thei smyten his heed with a reed, and bispatten hym; and thei kneliden, and worschipiden hym.
24841	41	15	20	And aftir that thei hadden scorned him, thei vnclothiden hym of purpur, and clothiden hym with hise clothis, and ledden out hym, to crucifie hym.
24842	41	15	21	And thei compelliden a man that passide the weie, that cam fro the toun, Symount of Syrenen, the fader of Alisaundir and of Rufe, to bere his cross.
24843	41	15	22	And thei ledden hym in to a place Golgatha, that is to seie, the place of Caluari.
24844	41	15	23	And thei yauen to hym to drynke wyn meddlid with mirre, and he took not.
24845	41	15	24	And thei crucifieden him, and departiden hise clothis, and kesten lot on tho, who schulde take what.
24846	41	15	25	And it was the thridde our, and thei crucifieden hym.
24847	41	15	26	And the titil of his cause was writun, Kyng of Jewis.
24848	41	15	27	And thei crucifien with hym twei theues, oon `at the riythalf and oon at his lefthalf.
24849	41	15	28	And the scripture was fulfillid that seith, And he is ordeyned with wickid men.
24850	41	15	29	And as thei passiden forth, thei blasfemyden hym, mouynge her heedis, and seiynge, Vath! thou that distriest the temple of God, and in `thre daies bildist it ayen;
24851	41	15	30	come adoun fro the crosse, and make thi silf saaf.
24852	41	15	31	Also the hiyeste prestis scorneden hym ech to othir with the scribis, and seiden, He made othir men saaf, he may not saue hym silf.
24853	41	15	32	Crist, kyng of Israel, come doun now fro the cross, that we seen, and bileuen. And thei that weren crucified with hym, dispiseden hym.
24854	41	15	33	And whanne the sixte hour was come, derknessis weren made on al the erthe til in to the nynthe our.
24855	41	15	34	And in the nynthe our Jhesus criede with a greet vois, and seide, Heloy, Heloy, lamasabatany, that is to seie, My God, my God, whi hast thou forsakun me?
24856	41	15	35	And summe of men that stoden aboute herden, and seiden, Lo! he clepith Helye.
24857	41	15	36	And oon ranne, and fillide a spounge with vynegre, and puttide aboute to a reede, and yaf to hym drynke, and seide, Suffre ye, se we, if Helie come to do hym doun.
24858	41	15	37	And Jhesus yaf out a greet cry, and diede.
24859	41	15	38	And the veil of the temple was rent atwo fro the hiyeste to bynethe.

24898	42	1	10	And al the multitude of the puple was with outforth, and preiede in the our of encensyng.

24902	42	1	14	And ioye and gladyng schal be to thee; and many schulen `haue ioye in his natyuyte.

24904	42	1	16	And he schal conuerte many of the children of Israel to her Lord God;

24907	42	1	19	And the aungel answeride, and seide to hym, For Y am Gabriel, that stonde niy bifor God; and Y am sent to thee to speke, and to euangelize to thee these thingis.
24908	42	1	20	And lo! thou schalt be doumbe, and thou schalt not mow speke til in to the dai, in which these thingis schulen be don; for thou hast not bileued to my wordis, whiche schulen be fulfillid in her tyme.
24909	42	1	21	And the puple was abidynge Zacarie, and thei wondriden, that he tariede in the temple.
24910	42	1	22	And he yede out, and myyte not speke to hem, and thei knewen that he hadde seyn a visioun in the temple. And he bikenyde to hem, and he dwellide stille doumbe.

24912	42	1	24	And aftir these daies Elizabeth, his wijf, conseyuede, and hidde hir fyue monethis, and seide,
24913	42	1	25	For so the Lord dide to me in the daies, in whiche he bihelde, to take awei my repreef among men.
24914	42	1	26	But in the sixte moneth the aungel Gabriel was sent fro God in to a citee of Galilee, whos name was Nazareth,

24922	42	1	34	And Marie seide to the aungel, On what maner schal this thing be doon, for Y knowe not man?
24923	42	1	35	And the aungel answeride, and seide to hir, The Hooly Goost schal come fro aboue in to thee, and the vertu of the Hiyeste schal ouerschadewe thee; and therfor that hooli thing that schal be borun of thee, schal be clepid the sone of God.

24927	42	1	39	And Marie roos vp in tho daies, and wente with haaste in to the mounteyns, in to a citee of Judee.
24928	42	1	40	And sche entride in to the hous of Zacarie, and grette Elizabeth.

25025	42	3	5	Ech valey schal be fulfillid, and euery hil and litil hil schal be maad lowe; and schrewid thingis schulen ben in to dressid thingis, and scharp thingis in to pleyn weies;
25026	42	3	6	and euery fleisch schal se the heelthe of God.
25027	42	3	7	Therfor he seid to the puple, which wente out to be baptisid of hym, Kyndlyngis of eddris, who schewide to you to fle fro the wraththe to comynge?
25028	42	3	8	Therfor do ye worthi fruytis of penaunce, and bigynne ye not to seie, We han a fadir Abraham; for Y seie to you, that God is myyti to reise of these stoonys the sones of Abraham.
25029	42	3	9	And now an axe is sett to the roote of the tree; and therfor euery tre that makith no good fruyt, schal be kit doun, and schal be cast in to the fier.
25030	42	3	10	And the puple axide hym, and seiden, What thanne schulen we do?
25031	42	3	11	He answeride, and seide to hem, He that hath twei cootis, yyue to hym that hath noon; and he that hath metis, do in lijk maner.
25032	42	3	12	And pupplicans camen to be baptisid; and thei seiden to hym, Maister, what schulen we do?
25033	42	3	13	And he seide to hem, Do ye no thing more, than that that is ordeyned to you.

25035	42	3	15	Whanne al the puple gesside, and alle men thouyten in her hertis of Joon, lest perauenture he were Crist,
25036	42	3	16	Joon answeride, and seide to alle men, Y baptize you in watir; but a stronger than Y schal come aftir me, of whom Y am not worthi to vnbynde the lace of his schoon; he schal baptize you in the Hooli Goost and fier.
25037	42	3	17	Whos `wynewyng tool in his hond, and he schal purge his floor of corn, and schal gadere the whete in to his berne; but the chaffis he schal brenne with fier vnquenchable.
25038	42	3	18	And many othere thingis also he spak, and prechide to the puple. But Eroude tetrark, whanne he was blamed of Joon for Erodias,

25040	42	3	20	encreside this ouer alle, and schitte Joon in prisoun.
25041	42	3	21	And it was don, whanne al the puple was baptised, and whanne Jhesu was baptised, and preiede, heuene was openyd.
25042	42	3	22	And the Hooli Goost cam doun in bodili licnesse, as a dowue on hym; and a vois was maad fro heuene, Thou art my derworth sone, in thee it hath plesid to me.
25043	42	3	23	And Jhesu hym silf was bigynninge as of thritti yeer, that he was gessid the sone of Joseph, which was of Heli,

25059	42	4	1	And Jhesus ful of the Hooli Goost turnede ayen fro Jordan, and was led bi the spirit into desert fourti daies,

25061	42	4	3	And the deuel seide to him, If thou art Goddis sone, seie to this stoon, that it be maad breed.
25062	42	4	4	And Jhesus answeride to hym, It is writun, That a man lyueth not in breed aloone, but in euery word of God.
25063	42	4	5	And the deuel ladde hym in to an hiy hil, and schewide to hym alle the rewmes of the world in a moment of tyme;
25064	42	4	6	and seide to hym, Y schal yyue to thee al this power, and the glorie of hem, for to me thei ben youun, and to whom Y wole, Y yyue hem;
25065	42	4	7	therfor if thou falle doun, and worschipe bifore me, alle thingis schulen be thine.

25067	42	4	9	And he ledde hym in to Jerusalem, and sette hym on the pynacle of the temple, and seide to hym, If thou art Goddis sone, sende thi silf fro hennes doun;
25068	42	4	10	for it is writun, For he hath comaundide to hise aungels of thee, that thei kepe thee in alle thi weies,
25069	42	4	11	and that thei schulen take thee in hondis, lest perauenture thou hirte thi foote at a stoon.
25070	42	4	12	And Jhesus answeride, and seide to him, It is seid, Thou schalt not tempte thi Lord God.
25071	42	4	13	And whanne euery temptacioun was endid, the feend wente a wei fro hym for a tyme.
25072	42	4	14	And Jhesus turnede ayen in the vertu of the spirit in to Galilee, and the fame wente forth of hym thorou al the cuntre.
25073	42	4	15	And he tauyte in the synagogis of hem, and was magnyfied of alle men.
25074	42	4	16	And he cam to Nazareth, where he was norisschid, and entride aftir his custom in the sabat dai in to a synagoge, and roos to reed.
25075	42	4	17	And the book of Ysaye, the prophete, was takun to hym; and as he turnede the book, he foond a place, where it was wrytun,

25079	42	4	21	And he bigan to seie to hem, For in this dai this scripture is fulfillid in youre eeris.
25080	42	4	22	And alle men yauen witnessyng to hym, and wondriden in the wordis of grace, that camen forth of his mouth. And thei seiden, Whether this is not the sone of Joseph?
25081	42	4	23	And he seide to hem, Sotheli ye schulen seie to me this liknesse, Leeche, heele thi silf. The Farisees seiden to Jhesu, Hou grete thingis han we herd don in Cafarnaum, do thou also here in thi cuntre.
25082	42	4	24	And he seide, Treuli Y seie to you, that no profete is resseyued in his owne cuntre.
25083	42	4	25	In treuthe Y seie to you, that many widowis weren in the daies of Elie, the prophete, in Israel, whanne heuene was closid thre yeer and sixe monethis, whanne greet hungur was maad in al the erthe;
25084	42	4	26	and to noon of hem was Elye sent, but in to Sarepta of Sydon, to a widowe.

25088	42	4	30	But Jhesus passide, and wente thorou the myddil of hem; and cam doun in to Cafarnaum,
25089	42	4	31	a citee of Galilee, and there he tauyte hem in sabotis.
25090	42	4	32	And thei weren astonyed in his techyng, for his word was in power.
25091	42	4	33	And in her synagoge was a man hauynge an vnclene feend, and he criede with greet vois,
25092	42	4	34	and seide, Suffre, what to vs and to thee, Jhesu of Nazareth? art thou comun to leese vs? Y knowe, that thou art the hooli of God.
25093	42	4	35	And Jhesus blamede hym, and seide, Wexe doumbe, and go out fro hym. And whanne the feend hadde cast hym forth in to the myddil, he wente a wei fro hym, and he noyede hym no thing.
25094	42	4	36	And drede was maad in alle men, and thei spaken togider, and seiden, What is this word, for in power and vertu he comaundith to vnclene spiritis, and thei gon out?
25095	42	4	37	And the fame was pupplischid of him in to ech place of the cuntre.
25096	42	4	38	And Jhesus roos vp fro the synagoge, and entride in to the hous of Symount; and the modir of Symountis wijf was holdun with grete fyueris, and thei preieden hym for hir.
25097	42	4	39	And Jhesus stood ouer hir, and comaundide to the feuer, and it lefte hir; and anoon sche roos vp, and seruede hem.
25098	42	4	40	And whanne the sunne wente doun, alle that hadden sijke men with dyuerse langours, ledden hem to hym; and he sette his hoondis on ech bi `hem silf, and heelide hem.
25099	42	4	41	And feendis wenten out fro manye, and crieden, and seiden, For thou art the sone of God. And he blamede, and suffride hem not to speke, for thei wisten hym, that he was Crist.
25100	42	4	42	And whanne the dai was come, he yede out, and wente in to a desert place; and the puple souyten hym, and thei camen to hym, and thei helden hym, that he schulde not go a wei fro hem.
25101	42	4	43	To whiche he seide, For also to othere citees it bihoueth me to preche the kyngdom of God, for therfor Y am sent.
25102	42	4	44	And he prechide in the synagogis of Galilee.
25103	42	5	1	And it was don, whanne the puple cam fast to Jhesu, to here the word of God, he stood bisidis the pool of Genasereth,
25104	42	5	2	and saiy two bootis stondynge bisidis the pool; and the fischeris weren go doun, and waischiden her nettis.
25105	42	5	3	And he wente vp in to a boot, that was Symoundis, and preiede hym to lede it a litil fro the loond; and he seet, and tauyte the puple out of the boot.
25106	42	5	4	And as he ceesside to speke, he seide to Symount, Lede thou in to the depthe, and slake youre nettis to take fisch.
25107	42	5	5	And Symount answeride, and seide to hym, Comaundoure, we traueliden al the nyyt, and token no thing, but in thi word Y schal leye out the net.
25108	42	5	6	And whanne thei hadden do this thing, thei closiden togidir a greet multitude of fischis; and her net was brokun.
25109	42	5	7	And thei bikenyden to felawis, that weren in anothir boot, that thei schulden come, and helpe hem. And thei camen, and filliden bothe the bootis, so that thei weren almost drenchid.
25110	42	5	8	And whanne Symount Petir saiy this thing, he felde doun to the knees of Jhesu, and seide, Lord, go fro me, for Y am a synful man.
25111	42	5	9	For he was on ech side astonyed, and alle that weren with hym, in the takyng of fischis whiche thei token.
25112	42	5	10	Sotheli in lijk maner James and Joon, the sones of Zebedee, that weren felowis of Symount Petre. And Jhesus seide to Symount, Nyle thou drede; now fro this tyme thou schalt take men.
25113	42	5	11	And whanne the bootis weren led vp to the loond, thei leften alle thingis, and thei sueden hym.
25114	42	5	12	And it was don, whanne he was in oon of the citees, lo! a man ful of lepre; and seynge Jhesu felle doun on his face, and preyede hym, and seide, Lord, if thou wolt, thou maist make me clene.
25115	42	5	13	And Jhesus held forth his hoond, and touchide hym, and seide, Y wole, be thou maad cleene. And anoon the lepre passide awei fro hym.
25116	42	5	14	And Jhesus comaundide to hym, that he schulde seie to no man; But go, schewe thou thee to a preest, and offre for thi clensyng, as Moises bad, in to witnessyng to hem.
25117	42	5	15	And the word walkide aboute the more of hym; and myche puple camen togidere, to here, and to be heelid of her siknessis.
25118	42	5	16	And he wente in to desert, and preiede.
25119	42	5	17	And it was don in oon of the daies, he sat, and tauyte; and there weren Farisees sittynge, and doctouris of the lawe, that camen of eche castel of Galilee, and of Judee, and of Jerusalem; and the vertu of the Lord was to heele sike men.
25120	42	5	18	And lo! men beren in a bed a man that was sijk in the palsye, and thei souyten to bere hym in, and sette bifor hym.
25121	42	5	19	And thei founden not in what partie thei schulden bere hym in, for the puple, `and thei wenten on the roof, and bi the sclattis thei leeten hym doun with the bed, in to the myddil, bifor Jhesus.
25122	42	5	20	And whanne Jhesu saiy the feith of hem, he seide, Man, thi synnes ben foryouun to thee.
25123	42	5	21	And the scribis and Farisees bigunnen to thenke, seiynge, Who is this, that spekith blasfemyes? who may foryyue synnes, but God aloone?
25124	42	5	22	And as Jhesus knewe the thouytis of hem, he answeride, and seide to hem, What thenken ye yuele thingis in youre hertes?
25125	42	5	23	What is liyter to seie, Synnes ben foryouun to thee, or to seie, Rise vp, and walke?
25126	42	5	24	But that ye wite, that mannus sone hath power in erthe to foryyue synnes, he seide to the sijk man in palesie, Y seie to thee, ryse vp, take thi bed, and go in to thin hous.
25127	42	5	25	And anoon he roos vp bifor hem, and took the bed in which he lay, and wente in to his hous, and magnyfiede God.
25128	42	5	26	And greet wondur took alle, and thei magnyfieden God; and thei weren fulfillid with greet drede, and seiden, For we han seyn merueilouse thingis to dai.
25129	42	5	27	And after these thingis Jhesus wente out, and saiy a pupplican, Leuy bi name, sittynge at the tolbothe. And he seide to hym, Sue thou me;
25130	42	5	28	and whanne he hadde left alle thingis, he roos vp, and suede hym.
25131	42	5	29	And Leuy made to hym a greet feeste in his hous; and ther was a greet cumpanye of pupplicans, and of othere that weren with hem, sittynge at the mete.
25132	42	5	30	And Farisees and the scribis of hem grutchiden, and seiden to hise disciplis, Whi eten ye and drynken with pupplicans and synful men?
25133	42	5	31	And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hem, Thei that ben hoole han no nede to a leche, but thei that ben sijke;
25134	42	5	32	for Y cam not to clepe iuste men, but synful men to penaunce.
25135	42	5	33	And thei seiden to hym, Whi the disciplis of Joon fasten ofte, and maken preieris, also and of Farisees, but thine eten and drynken?
25136	42	5	34	To whiche he seide, Whether ye moun make the sones of the spouse to faste, while the spouse is with hem?
25137	42	5	35	But daies schulen come, whanne the spouse schal be takun a wei fro hem, and thanne thei schulen faste in tho daies.
25138	42	5	36	And he seide to hem also a liknesse; For no man takith a pece fro a newe cloth, and puttith it in to an oold clothing; ellis bothe he brekith the newe, and the pece of the newe acordith not to the elde.
25139	42	5	37	And no man puttith newe wyne in to oolde botels; ellis the newe wyn schal breke the botels, and the wyn schal be sched out, and the botels schulen perische.
25140	42	5	38	But newe wyne owith to be put in to newe botels, and bothe ben kept.
25141	42	5	39	And no man drynkynge the elde, wole anoon the newe; for he seith, The olde is the betere.
25142	42	6	1	And it was don in the secounde firste sabat, whanne he passid bi cornes, hise disciplis pluckiden eeris of corn; and thei frotynge with her hondis, eeten.
25143	42	6	2	And summe of the Farisees seiden to hem, What doon ye that, that is not leeueful in the sabotis?
25144	42	6	3	And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hem, Han ye not redde, what Dauith dide, whanne he hungride, and thei that weren with hym;
25145	42	6	4	hou he entride in to the hous of God, and took looues of proposicioun, and eet, and yaf to hem that weren with hem; whiche looues it was not leeueful to eete, but oonli to prestis.
25146	42	6	5	And he seide to hem, For mannus sone is lord, yhe, of the sabat.
25147	42	6	6	And it was don in another sabat, that he entride in to a synagoge, and tauyte. And a man was there, and his riyt hoond was drie.
25148	42	6	7	And the scribis and Farisees aspieden hym, if he wolde heele hym in the sabat, that thei schulden fynde cause, whereof thei schulden accuse hym.
25149	42	6	8	And he wiste the thouytis of hem, and he seide to the man that hadde a drie hoond, Rise vp, and stonde in to the myddil. And he roos, and stood.
25150	42	6	9	And Jhesus seide to hem, Y axe you, if it is leueful to do wel in the sabat, or yuel? to make a soule saaf, or to leese?
25151	42	6	10	And whanne he hadde biholde alle men aboute, he seide to the man, Hold forth thin hoond. And he held forth, and his hond was restorid to helthe.
25152	42	6	11	And thei weren fulfillid with vnwisdom, and spaken togidir, what thei schulden do of Jhesu.
25153	42	6	12	And it was don in tho daies, he wente out in to an hil to preye; and he was al nyyt dwellynge in the preier of God.
25154	42	6	13	And whanne the day was come, he clepide hise disciplis, and chees twelue of hem, whiche he clepide also apostlis;
25155	42	6	14	Symount, whom he clepide Petir, and Andrew, his brothir, James and Joon,
25156	42	6	15	Filip and Bartholomew, Matheu and Thomas, James Alphei, and Symount, that is clepid Zelotes,
25157	42	6	16	Judas of James, and Judas Scarioth, that was traytoure.
25158	42	6	17	And Jhesus cam doun fro the hil with hem, and stood in a feeldi place; and the cumpeny of hise disciplis, and a greet multitude of puple, of al Judee, and Jerusalem, and of the see coostis, and of Tyre and Sidon,
25159	42	6	18	that camen to here hym, and to be heelid of her siknessis; and thei that weren trauelid of vncleene spiritis, weren heelid.
25160	42	6	19	And al puple souyte to touche hym, for vertu wente out of hym, and heelide alle.
25161	42	6	20	And whanne hise iyen weren cast vp in to hise disciplis, he seide, Blessid be ye, `pore men, for the kyngdom of God is youre.
25162	42	6	21	Blessid be ye, that now hungren, for ye schulen be fulfillid. Blessid be ye, that now wepen, for ye schulen leiye.
25163	42	6	22	Ye schulen be blessid, whanne men schulen hate you, and departe you awei, and putte schenschip to you, and cast out youre name as yuel, for mannus sone.
25164	42	6	23	Joye ye in that dai, and be ye glad; for lo! youre meede is myche in heuene; for aftir these thingis the fadris of hem diden to prophetis.
25165	42	6	24	Netheles wo to you, riche men, that han youre coumfort.
25166	42	6	25	Wo to you that ben fulfillid, for ye schulen hungre. Wo to you that now leiyen, for ye schulen morne, and wepe.
25167	42	6	26	Wo to you, whanne alle men schulen blesse you; aftir these thingis the fadris of hem diden to profetis.
25168	42	6	27	But Y seie to you that heren, loue ye youre enemyes, do ye wel to hem that hatiden you;
25169	42	6	28	blesse ye men that cursen you, preye ye for men that defamen you.
25170	42	6	29	And to him that smytith thee on o cheeke, schewe also the tothir; and fro hym that takith awei fro thee a cloth, nyle thou forbede the coote.
25171	42	6	30	And yyue to eche that axith thee, and if a man takith awei tho thingis that ben thine, axe thou not ayen.
25172	42	6	31	And as ye wolen that men do to you, do ye also to hem in lijk maner.
25173	42	6	32	And if ye louen hem that louen you, what thanke is to you? for synful men louen men that louen hem.
25174	42	6	33	And if ye don wel to hem that don wel to you, what grace is to you? synful men don this thing.
25175	42	6	34	And if ye leenen to hem of whiche ye hopen to take ayen, what thanke is to you? for synful men leenen to synful men, to take ayen as myche.
25176	42	6	35	Netheles loue ye youre enemyes, and do ye wel, and leene ye, hopinge no thing therof, and youre mede schal be myche, and ye schulen be the sones of the Heyest, for he is benygne on vnkynde men and yuele men.
25177	42	6	36	Therfor be ye merciful, as youre fadir is merciful.
25178	42	6	37	Nyle ye deme, and ye schulen not be demed. Nyle ye condempne, and ye schulen not be condempned; foryyue ye, and it schal be foryouun to you.
25179	42	6	38	Yyue ye, and it schal be youun to you. Thei schulen yyue in to youre bosum a good mesure, and wel fillid, and schakun togidir, and ouerflowynge; for bi the same mesure, bi whiche ye meeten, it schal be metun `ayen to you.
25180	42	6	39	And he seide to hem a liknesse, Whether the blynde may leede the blynde? ne fallen thei not bothe `in to the diche?
25181	42	6	40	A disciple is not aboue the maistir; but eche schal be perfite, if he be as his maister.
25182	42	6	41	And what seest thou in thi brotheris iye a moot, but thou biholdist not a beem, that is in thin owne iye?
25183	42	6	42	Or hou maist thou seie to thi brother, Brothir, suffre, Y schal caste out the moot of thin iye, and thou biholdist not a beem in thin owne iye? Ipocrite, first take out the beem of thin iye, and thanne thou schalt se to take the moot of thi brotheris iye.
25184	42	6	43	It is not a good tree, that makith yuel fruytis, nether an yuel tree, that makith good fruytis;
25185	42	6	44	for euery tre is knowun of his fruyt. And men gaderen not figus of thornes, nethir men gaderen a grape of a buysche of breris.
25186	42	6	45	A good man of the good tresoure of his herte bryngith forth good thingis, and an yuel man of the yuel tresoure bryngith forth yuel thingis; for of the plente of the herte the mouth spekith.
25187	42	6	46	And what clepen ye me, Lord, Lord, and doon not tho thingis that Y seie.
25188	42	6	47	Eche that cometh to me, and herith my wordis, and doith hem, Y schal schewe to you, to whom he is lijk.
25189	42	6	48	He is lijk to a man that bildith an hous, that diggide deepe, and sette the foundement on a stoon. And whanne greet flood was maad, the flood was hurtlid to that hous, and it miyte not moue it, for it was foundid on a sad stoon.
25190	42	6	49	But he that herith, and doith not, is lijk to a man bildynge his hous on erthe with outen foundement; in to which the flood was hurlid, and anoon it felle doun; and the fallyng doun of that hous was maad greet.
25191	42	7	1	And whanne he hadde fulfillid alle hise wordis in to the eeris of the puple, he entride in to Cafarnaum.
25192	42	7	2	But a seruaunt of a centurien, that was precious to hym, was sijk, and drawynge to the deeth.
25193	42	7	3	And whanne he hadde herd of Jhesu, he sente to hym the eldere men of Jewis, and preiede hym, that he wolde come, and heele his seruaunt.
25194	42	7	4	And whanne thei camen to Jhesu, thei preieden hym bisili, and seiden to hym, For he is worthi, that thou graunte to hym this thing;
25195	42	7	5	for he loueth oure folk, and he bildide to vs a synagoge.
25196	42	7	6	And Jhesus wente with hem. And whanne he was not fer fro the hous, the centurien sente to hym freendis, and seide, Lord, nyle thou be trauelid, for Y am not worthi, that thou entre vnder my roof;
25197	42	7	7	for which thing and Y demede not my silf worthi, that Y come to thee; but seie thou bi word, and my child schal be helid.
25198	42	7	8	For Y am a man ordeyned vndur power, and haue knyytis vndur me; and Y seie to this, Go, and he goith, and to anothir, Come, and he cometh, and to my seruaunt, Do this thing, and he doith.
25199	42	7	9	And whanne this thing was herd, Jhesus wondride; and seide to the puple suynge hym, Treuli Y seie to you, nether in Israel Y foond so greet feith.
25200	42	7	10	And thei that weren sent, turneden ayen home, and founden the seruaunt hool, which was sijk.
25201	42	7	11	And it was don aftirward, Jhesus wente in to a citee, that is clepid Naym, and hise disciplis; and ful greet puple wente with hym.
25202	42	7	12	And whanne he cam nyy to the yate of the citee, lo! the sone of a womman that hadde no mo children, was borun out deed; and this was a widowe; and myche puple of the citee with hir.
25203	42	7	13	And whanne the Lord Jhesu hadde seyn hir, he hadde reuthe on hir, and seide to hir, Nyle thou wepe.
25204	42	7	14	And he cam nyy, and touchide the beere; and thei that baren stoden. And he seide, Yonge man, Y seie to thee, rise vp.
25205	42	7	15	And he that was deed sat vp ayen, and bigan to speke; and he yaf hym to his modir.
25206	42	7	16	And drede took alle men, and thei magnyfieden God, and seiden, For a grete profete is rysun among vs, and, For God hath visitid his puple.
25207	42	7	17	And this word wente out of hym in to al Judee, and in to al the cuntre aboute.
25208	42	7	18	And Joones disciplis toolden hym of alle these thingis.
25209	42	7	19	And Joon clepide tweyn of hise disciplis, and sente hem to Jhesu, and seide, Art thou he that is to come, or abiden we anothir?
25210	42	7	20	And whanne the men cam to hym, thei seiden, Joon Baptist sente vs to thee, and seide, Art thou he that is to come, or we abiden anothir?
25211	42	7	21	And in that our he heelide many men of her sijknessis, and woundis, and yuel spiritis; and he yaf siyt to many blynde men.
25212	42	7	22	And Jhesus answerde, and seide to hem, Go ye ayen, and telle ye to Joon tho thingis that ye han herd and seyn; blynde men seyn, crokid men goen, mesels ben maad cleene, deef men heren, deed men risen ayen, pore men ben takun to prechyng of the gospel.
25213	42	7	23	And he that schal not be sclaundrid in me, is blessid.
25214	42	7	24	And whanne the messangeris of Joon weren go forth, he bigan to seie of Joon to the puple,
25215	42	7	25	What wenten ye out in to desert to se? a reed waggid with the wynd?
25216	42	7	26	But what wenten ye out to se? a man clothid with softe clothis? Lo! thei that ben in precious cloth and in delicis, ben in kyngis housis. But what wenten ye out to se? a profete? Yhe, Y seie to you, and more than a profete.
25217	42	7	27	This is he, of whom it is writun, Lo! Y sende myn aungel bifor thi face, which schal make `thi weie redi bifor thee.
25218	42	7	28	Certis Y seie to you, there is no man more prophete among children of wymmen, than is Joon; but he that is lesse in the kyngdom of heuenes, is more than he.
25219	42	7	29	And al the puple herynge, and pupplicans, that hadden be baptisid with baptym of Joon, iustifieden God;
25220	42	7	30	but the Farisees and the wise men of the lawe, that weren not baptisid of hym, dispisiden the counsel of God ayens hem silf.
25221	42	7	31	And the Lord seide, Therfor to whom schal Y seie `men of this generacioun lijk, and to whom ben thei lijk?
25222	42	7	32	Thei ben lijk to children sittynge in chepyng, and spekynge togider, and seiynge, We han sungun to you with pipis, and ye han not daunsid; we han maad mornyng, and ye han not wept.
25223	42	7	33	For Joon Baptist cam, nethir etynge breed, ne drynkynge wyne, and ye seyen, He hath a feend.
25224	42	7	34	Mannus sone cam etynge and drynkynge, and ye seien, Lo! a man a deuourer, and drynkynge wyne, a frend of pupplicans and of synful men.
25225	42	7	35	And wisdom is iustified of her sones.
25226	42	7	36	But oon of the Farisees preiede Jhesu, that he schulde ete with hym. And he entride in to the hous of the Farise, and sat at the mete.
25227	42	7	37	And lo! a synful womman, that was in the citee, as sche knewe, that Jhesu sat at the mete in the hous of the Farisee, sche brouyte an alabaustre box of oynement;
25228	42	7	38	and sche stood bihynde bysidis hise feet, and bigan to moiste hise feet with teeris, and wipide with the heeris of hir heed, and kiste hise feet, and anoyntide with oynement.
25229	42	7	39	And the Farise seynge, that hadde clepide hym, seide within hym silf, seiynge, If this were a prophete, he schulde wite, who and what maner womman it were that touchith hym, for sche is a synful womman.
25230	42	7	40	And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hym, Symount, Y haue sumthing to seie to thee. And he seide, Maistir, seie thou.
25231	42	7	41	And he answeride, Twei dettouris weren to o lener; and oon auyt fyue hundrid pans, and `the other fifti; but whanne thei hadden not wherof `thei schulden yeelde, he foryaf to bothe. Who thanne loueth hym more?
25232	42	7	43	Symount answeride, and seide, Y gesse, that he to whom he foryaf more. And he answeride to hym, Thou hast demyd riytli.
25233	42	7	44	And he turnede to the womman, and seide to Symount, Seest thou this womman? I entride into thin hous, thou yaf no watir to my feet; but this hath moistid my feet with teeris, and wipide with hir heeris.
25234	42	7	45	Thou hast not youun to me a cosse; but this, sithen sche entride, ceesside not to kisse my feet.
25235	42	7	46	Thou anoyntidist not myn heed with oile; but this anoyntide my feet with oynement.
25236	42	7	47	For the which thing Y seie to thee, many synnes ben foryouun to hir, for sche hath loued myche; and to whom is lesse foryouun, he loueth lesse.
25237	42	7	48	And Jhesus seide to hir, Thi synnes ben foryouun to thee.
25238	42	7	49	And thei that saten to gider at the mete, bigunnen to seie with ynne hem silf, Who is this that foryyueth synnes.
25239	42	7	50	But he seide to the womman, Thi feith hath maad thee saaf; go thou in pees.
25240	42	8	1	And it was don aftirward, and Jhesus made iourney bi citees and castels, prechynge and euangelisynge the rewme of God, and twelue with hym;
25241	42	8	2	and sum wymmen that weren heelid of wickid spiritis and sijknessis, Marie, that is clepid Maudeleyn, of whom seuene deuelis wenten out,
25242	42	8	3	and Joone, the wijf of Chuse, the procuratoure of Eroude, and Susanne, and many othir, that mynystriden to hym of her ritchesse.
25243	42	8	4	And whanne myche puple was come togidir, and men hiyeden to hym fro the citees, he seide bi a symylitude,
25244	42	8	5	He that sowith, yede out to sowe his seed. And while he sowith, sum fel bisidis the weie, and was defoulid, and briddis of the eir eten it.
25245	42	8	6	And othir fel on a stoon, and it sprunge vp, and driede, for it hadde not moysture.
25246	42	8	7	And othir fel among thornes, and the thornes sprongen vp togider, and strangliden it.
25247	42	8	8	And othir fel in to good erthe, and it sprungun made an hundrid foold fruyt. He seide these thingis, and criede, He that hath eeris of heryng, here he.
25248	42	8	9	But hise disciplis axiden him, what this parable was.
25249	42	8	10	And he seide to hem, To you it is grauntid to knowe the pryuete of the kyngdom of God; but to othir men in parablis, that thei seynge se not, and thei herynge vndurstonde not.
25250	42	8	11	And this is the parable.
25251	42	8	12	The seed is Goddis word; and thei that ben bisidis the weie, ben these that heren; and aftirward the feend cometh, and takith awei the word fro her herte, lest thei bileuynge be maad saaf.
25252	42	8	13	But thei that fel on a stoon, ben these that whanne thei han herd, resseyuen the word with ioye. And these han not rootis; for at a tyme thei bileuen, and in tyme of temptacioun thei goen awei.
25253	42	8	14	But that that fel among thornes, ben these that herden, and of bisynessis, and ritchessis, and lustis of lijf thei gon forth, and ben stranglid, and bryngen forth no fruyt.
25254	42	8	15	But that that fel in to good erthe, ben these that, in a good herte, and best heren the word, and holdun, and brengen forth fruyt in pacience.
25255	42	8	16	No man lityneth a lanterne, and hilith it with a vessel, or puttith it vndur a bed, but on a candilstike, that men that entren seen liyt.
25256	42	8	17	For ther is no priuei thing, which schal not be openyd, nether hid thing, which schal not be knowun, and come in to open.
25257	42	8	18	Therfor se ye, hou ye heren; for it schal be youun to hym that hath, and who euer hath not, also that that he weneth that he haue, schal be takun awei fro hym.
25258	42	8	19	And his modir and britheren camen to hym; and thei myyten not come to hym for the puple.
25259	42	8	20	And it was teeld to hym, Thi modir and thi britheren stonden with outforth, willynge to se thee.
25260	42	8	21	And he answeride, and seide to hem, My modir and my britheren ben these, that heren the word of God, and doon it.
25261	42	8	22	And it was don in oon of daies, he wente vp in to a boot, and hise disciplis. And he seide to hem, Passe we ouer the see. And thei wenten vp.
25262	42	8	23	And while thei rowiden, he slepte. And a tempest of wynde cam doun in to the watir, and thei weren dryuun hidur and thidur with wawis, and weren in perel.
25263	42	8	24	And thei camen nyy, and reisiden hym, and seiden, Comaundoure, we perischen. And he roos, and blamyde the wynde, and the tempest of the watir; and it ceesside, and pesibilte was maad.
25264	42	8	25	And he seide to hem, Where is youre feith? Which dredynge wondriden, and seiden togidir, Who, gessist thou, is this? for he comaundith to wyndis and to the see, and thei obeien to hym.
25265	42	8	26	And thei rowiden to the cuntree of Gerasenus, that is ayens Galilee.
25266	42	8	27	And whanne he wente out to the loond, a man ran to hym, that hadde a deuel long tyme, and he was not clothid with cloth, nether dwellide in hous, but in sepulcris.
25267	42	8	28	This, whanne he saiy Jhesu, fel doun bifor hym, and he criynge with a greet vois seide, What to me and to thee, Jhesu, the sone of the hiyest God? Y biseche thee, that thou turmente `not me.
25268	42	8	29	For he comaundide the vncleene spirit, that he schulde go out fro the man. For he took hym ofte tymes, and he was boundun with cheynes, and kept in stockis, and, whanne the boondis weren brokun, he was lad of deuelis in to desert.
25269	42	8	30	And Jhesus axide hym, and seide, What name is to thee? And he seide, A legioun; for many deuelis weren entrid in to hym.
25270	42	8	31	And thei preyden hym, that he schulde not comaunde hem, that thei schulden go in to helle.
25271	42	8	32	And there was a flok of many swyne lesewynge in an hil, and thei preieden hym, that he schulde suffre hem to entre in to hem. And he suffride hem.
25272	42	8	33	And so the deuelis wenten out fro the man, and entriden in to the swyne; and with a birre the flok wente heedlyng in to the pool, and was drenchid.
25273	42	8	34	And whanne the hirdis sayn this thing don, thei flowen, and tolden in to the cite, and in to the townes.
25274	42	8	35	And thei yeden out to se that thing that was don. And thei camen to Jhesu, and thei founden the man sittynge clothid, fro whom the deuelis wenten out, and in hool mynde at hise feet; and thei dredden.
25275	42	8	36	And thei that sayn tolden to hem, hou he was maad hool of the legioun.
25276	42	8	37	And al the multitude of the cuntre of Gerasenus preiede hym, that he schulde go fro hem, for thei werun holdun with greet drede. He wente vp in to a boot, and turnede ayen.
25277	42	8	38	And the man of whom the deuelis weren gon out, preide hym, that he schulde be with hym. Jhesus lefte hym,
25278	42	8	39	and seide, Go ayen in to thin hous, and telle hou grete thingis God hath don to thee. And he wente thorow al the cite, and prechide, hou grete thingis Jhesus hadde don to hym.
25279	42	8	40	And it was don, whanne Jhesus was gon ayen, the puple resseyuede hym; for alle weren abidynge hym.
25280	42	8	41	And lo! a man, to whom the name was Jayrus, and he was prynce of a synagoge; and he fel doun at the feet of Jhesu, and preiede hym, that he schulde entre in to his hous,
25281	42	8	42	for he hadde but o douyter `almost of twelue yeer eelde, and sche was deed. And it bifel, the while he wente, he was thrungun of the puple.
25282	42	8	43	And a womman that hadde a flux of blood twelue yeer, and hadde spendid al hir catel in leechis, and sche miyte not be curid of ony,
25283	42	8	44	and sche cam nyy bihynde, and touchide the hem of his cloth, and anoon the fluxe of hir blood ceesside.
25284	42	8	45	And Jhesus seide, Who is that touchide me? And whanne alle men denyeden, Petre seide, and thei that weren with hym, Comaundour, the puple thristen, and disesen thee, and thou seist, Who touchide me?
25285	42	8	46	And Jhesus seide, Summan hath touchid me, for that vertu yede out of me.
25286	42	8	47	And the womman seynge, that it was not hid fro hym, cam tremblynge, and fel doun at hise feet, and for what cause sche hadde touchid hym sche schewide bifor al the puple, and hou anoon sche was helid.
25287	42	8	48	And he seide to hir, Douytir, thi feith hath maad thee saaf; go thou in pees.
25288	42	8	49	And yit while he spak, a man cam fro the prince of the synagoge, and seide to hym, Thi douytir is deed, nyle thou trauel the maister.
25289	42	8	50	And whanne this word was herd, Jhesus answeride to the fadir of the damysel, Nyle thou drede, but bileue thou oonli, and sche schal be saaf.
25290	42	8	51	And whanne he cam to the hous, he suffride no man to entre with hym, but Petir and Joon and James, and the fadir and the modir of the damysel.
25291	42	8	52	And alle wepten, and biweileden hir. And he seide, Nyle ye wepe, for the damysel is not deed, but slepith.
25292	42	8	53	And thei scorneden hym, and wisten that sche was deed.
25293	42	8	54	But he helde hir hoond, and criede, and seide, Damysel, rise vp.
25294	42	8	55	And hir spirit turnede ayen, and sche roos anoon. And he comaundide to yyue to hir to ete.
25295	42	8	56	And hir fadir and modir wondriden greetli; and he comaundide hem, that thei schulden not seie to ony that thing that was don.
25296	42	9	1	And whanne the twelue apostlis weren clepid togidir, Jhesus yaf to hem vertu and power on alle deuelis, and that thei schulden heele sijknessis.
25297	42	9	2	And he sente hem for to preche the kyngdom of God, and to heele sijk men.
25298	42	9	3	And he seide to hem, No thing take ye in the weie, nether yerde, ne scrippe, nether breed, ne money, and nether haue ye two cootis.
25299	42	9	4	And in to what hous that ye entren, dwelle ye there, and go ye not out fro thennus.
25300	42	9	5	And who euer resseyuen not you, go ye out of that citee, and schake ye of the poudir of youre feet in to witnessyng on hem.
25301	42	9	6	And thei yeden forth, and wenten aboute bi castels, prechynge and helynge euery where.
25302	42	9	7	And Eroude tetrak herde alle thingis that weren don of hym, and he doutide,
25303	42	9	8	for that it was seide of sum men, that Joon was risen fro deth; and of summen, that Elie hadde apperid; but of othere, that oon of the elde prophetis was risun.
25304	42	9	9	And Eroude seide, Y haue biheedid Joon; and who is this, of whom Y here siche thingis? And he souyte to se hym.
25305	42	9	10	And the apostlis turneden ayen, and tolden to hym alle thingis that thei hadden don. And he took hem, and wente bisidis in to a desert place, that is Bethsada.
25306	42	9	11	And whanne the puple knewen this, thei folewiden hym. And he resseyuede hem, and spak to hem of the kyngdom of God; and he heelide hem that hadden neede of cure.
25307	42	9	12	And the dai bigan to bowe doun, and the twelue camen, and seiden to hym, Leeue the puple, that thei go, and turne in to castels and townes, that ben aboute, that thei fynde mete, for we ben here in a desert place.
25308	42	9	13	And he seide to hem, Yue ye to hem to ete. And thei seiden, Ther ben not to vs mo than fyue looues and twei fischis, but perauenture that we go, and bie meetis to al this puple.
25309	42	9	14	And the men weren almost fyue thousynde. And he seide to hise disciplis, Make ye hem sitte to mete bi cumpanyes, a fifti to gidir.
25310	42	9	15	And thei diden so, and thei maden alle men sitte to mete.
25311	42	9	16	And whanne he hadde take the fyue looues and twei fischis, he biheeld in to heuene, and blesside hem, and brak, and delide to hise disciplis, that thei schulden sette forth bifor the cumpanyes.
25312	42	9	17	And alle men eeten, and weren fulfillid; and that that lefte to hem of brokun metis was takun vp, twelue cofyns.
25313	42	9	18	And it was don, whanne he was aloone preiynge, hise disciplis weren with hym, and he axide hem, and seide, Whom seien the puple that Y am?
25314	42	9	19	And thei answeriden, and seiden, Joon Baptist, othir seien Elie, and othir seien, o profete of the formere is risun.
25315	42	9	20	And he seide to hem, But who seien ye that Y am? Symount Petir answeride, and seide, The Crist of God.
25316	42	9	21	And he blamynge hem comaundide that thei schulden seie to no man,
25317	42	9	22	and seide these thingis, For it bihoueth mannus sone to suffre many thingis, and to be repreued of the elder men, and of the princis of prestis, and of scribis, and to be slayn, and the thridde dai to rise ayen.
25318	42	9	23	And he seide to alle, If ony wole come aftir me, denye he hym silf, and take he his cross euery dai, and sue he me.
25319	42	9	24	For he that wole make his lijf saaf schal leese it; and he that leesith his lijf for me, schal make it saaf.
25320	42	9	25	And what profitith it to a man, if he wynne al the world, and leese hymsilf, and do peiryng of him silf.
25321	42	9	26	For who so schameth me and my wordis, mannus sone schal schame hym, whanne he cometh in his maieste, and of the fadris, and of the hooli aungels.
25322	42	9	27	And Y seie to you, verily ther ben summe stondynge here, whiche schulen not taste deeth, til thei seen the rewme of God.
25323	42	9	28	And it was don aftir these wordis almest eiyte daies, and he took Petre and James and Joon, and he stiede in to an hil, to preye.
25324	42	9	29	And while he preiede, the licnesse of his cheer was chaungid, and his clothing was whit schynynge.
25325	42	9	30	And lo! two men spaken with hym,
25326	42	9	31	and Moises and Helie weren seen in maieste; and thei sayn his goyng out, which he schulde fulfille in Jerusalem.
25327	42	9	32	And Petre, and thei that weren with hym, weren heuy of sleep, and thei wakynge saien his majeste, and the twey men that stoden with hym.
25328	42	9	33	And it was don, whanne thei departiden fro hym, Petir seide to Jhesu, Comaundour, it is good that we be here, and make we here thre tabernaclis, oon to thee, and oon to Moises, and oon to Elie. And he wiste not what he schulde seie.
25329	42	9	34	But while he spak these thingis, a cloude was maad, and ouerschadewide hem; and thei dredden, whanne thei entriden in to the cloude.
25330	42	9	35	And a vois was maad out of the cloude, and seide, This is my derworth sone, here ye hym.
25331	42	9	36	And while the vois was maad, Jhesu was foundun aloone. And thei weren stille, and to no man seiden in tho daies ouyt of tho thingis, that thei hadden seyn.
25332	42	9	37	But it was doon in the dai suynge, whanne thei camen doun of the hil, myche puple mette hem.
25333	42	9	38	And lo! a man of the cumpany criede, and seide, Maister, Y biseche thee, biholde my sone, for Y haue no mo; and lo!
25334	42	9	39	a spirit takith hym, and sudenli he crieth, and hurtlith doun, and to-drawith hym with fome, and vnneth he goith awei al to-drawynge hym.
25335	42	9	40	And Y preiede thi disciplis, that thei schulden caste hym out, and thei myyten not.
25336	42	9	41	And Jhesus answerde and seide to hem, A! vnfeithful generacioun and weiward, hou long schal Y be at you, and suffre you? brynge hidur thi sone.
25337	42	9	42	And whanne he cam nyy, the deuel hurtlide hym doun, and to-braidide hym. And Jhesus blamyde `the vnclene spirit, and heelide the child, and yeldide him to his fadir.
25338	42	9	43	And alle men wondriden greetli in the gretnesse of God. And whanne alle men wondriden in alle thingis that he dide, he seide to hise disciplis,
25339	42	9	44	Putte ye these wordis in youre hertis, for it is to come, that mannus sone be bitrayed in to the hondis of men.
25340	42	9	45	And thei knewen not this word, and it was hid bifor hem, that thei feeliden it not; and thei dredden to axe hym of this word.
25341	42	9	46	But a thouyt entride in to hem, who of hem schulde be grettest.
25342	42	9	47	And Jhesu, seynge the thouytis of the herte of hem, took a child, and settide hym bisidis hym;
25343	42	9	48	and seide to hem, Who euer resseyueth this child in my name, resseyueth me; and who euer resseyueth me, resseiueth him that sente me; for he that is leest among you alle, is the grettest.
25344	42	9	49	And Joon answeride and seide, Comaundoure, we sayn a man castynge out feendis in thi name, and we han forbedun hym, for he sueth not thee with vs.
25345	42	9	50	And Jhesus seide to hym, Nyle ye forbede, for he that is not ayens vs, is for vs.
25346	42	9	51	And it was don, whanne the daies of his takyng vp weren fulfillid, he settide faste his face, to go to Jerusalem,
25347	42	9	52	and sente messangeris bifor his siyt. And thei yeden, and entriden in to a citee of Samaritans, to make redi to hym.
25348	42	9	53	And thei resseyueden not hym, for the face `was of hym goynge in to Jerusalem.
25349	42	9	54	And whanne James and Joon, hise disciplis, seyn, thei seiden, Lord, wolt thou that we seien, that fier come doun fro heuene, and waste hem?
25350	42	9	55	And he turnede, and blamyde hem, and seide, Ye witen not, whos spiritis ye ben;
25351	42	9	56	for mannus sone cam not to leese mennus soulis, but to saue. And thei wenten in to another castel.
25352	42	9	57	And it was don, whanne thei walkeden in the weie, a man seide to hym, Y schal sue thee, whidur euer thou go.
25353	42	9	58	And Jhesus seide to hym, Foxis han dennes, and briddis of the eir han nestis, but mannus sone hath not where he reste his heed.
25354	42	9	59	And he seide to another, Sue thou me. And he seide, Lord, suffre me first to go, and birie my fadir.
25355	42	9	60	And Jhesus seide to hym, Suffre that deede men birie hir deede men; but go thou, and telle the kyngdom of God.
25356	42	9	61	And another seide, Lord, Y schal sue thee, but first suffre me to leeue `alle thingis that ben at hoom.
25357	42	9	62	And Jhesus seide to hym, No man that puttith his hoond to the plouy, and biholdynge bacward, is able to the rewme of God.
25358	42	10	1	And aftir these thingis the Lord Jhesu ordeynede also othir seuenti and tweyn, and sente hem bi tweyn and tweyn bifor his face in to euery citee and place, whidir he was to come.
25359	42	10	2	And he seide to hem, There is myche ripe corn, and fewe werke men; therfor preie ye the lord of the ripe corn, that he sende werke men in to his ripe corn.
25360	42	10	3	Go ye, lo! Y sende you as lambren among wolues.
25361	42	10	4	Therfor nyle ye bere a sachel, nethir scrippe, nethir schoon, and greete ye no man bi the weie.
25362	42	10	5	In to what hous that ye entren, first seie ye, Pees to this hous.
25363	42	10	6	And if a sone of pees be there, youre pees schal reste on hym; but if noon, it schal turne ayen to you.
25364	42	10	7	And dwelle ye in the same hous, etynge and drynkynge tho thingis that ben at hem; for a werk man is worthi his hire. Nyle ye passe from hous in to hous.
25365	42	10	8	And in to what euer citee ye entren, and thei resseyuen you, ete ye tho thingis that ben set to you;
25366	42	10	9	and heele ye the sijke men that ben in that citee. And seie ye to hem, The kyngdom of God schal neiye in to you.
25367	42	10	10	In to what citee ye entren, and thei resseyuen you not, go ye out in to the streetis of it,
25368	42	10	11	and seie ye, We wipen of ayens you the poudir that cleued to vs of youre citee; netheles wite ye this thing, that the rewme of God schal come nyy.
25369	42	10	12	Y seie to you, that to Sodom it schal be esiere than to that citee in that dai.
25370	42	10	13	Wo to thee, Corosayn; wo to thee, Bethsaida; for if in Tyre and Sidon the vertues hadden be don, whiche han be don in you, sum tyme thei wolden haue sete in heyre and asches, and haue don penaunce.
25371	42	10	14	Netheles to Tire and Sidon it schal be esiere in the doom than to you.
25372	42	10	15	And thou, Cafarnaum, art enhaunsid `til to heuene; thou schalt be drenchid `til in to helle.
25373	42	10	16	He that herith you, herith me; and he that dispisith you, dispisith me; and he that dispisith me, dispisith hym that sente me.
25374	42	10	17	And the two and seuenti disciplis turneden ayen with ioye, and seiden, Lord, also deuelis ben suget to vs in thi name.
25375	42	10	18	And he seide to hem, Y saiy Sathnas fallynge doun fro heuene, as leit.
25376	42	10	19	And lo! Y haue youun to you power to trede on serpentis, and on scorpyouns, and on al the vertu of the enemy, and nothing schal anoye you.
25377	42	10	20	Netheles nyle ye ioye on this thing, that spiritis ben suget to you; but ioye ye, that youre names ben writun in heuenes.
25378	42	10	21	In thilk our he gladide in the Hooli Goost, and seide, Y knouleche to thee, fadir, Lord of heuene and of erthe, for thou hast hid these thingis fro wise men and prudent, and hast schewid hem to smale children. Yhe, fadir, for so it pleside bifor thee.
25379	42	10	22	Alle thingis ben youun to me of my fadir, and no man woot, who is the sone, but the fadir; and who is the fadir, but the sone, and to whom the sone wole schewe.
25380	42	10	23	And he turnede to hise disciplis, and seide, Blessid ben the iyen, that seen tho thingis that ye seen.
25381	42	10	24	For Y seie to you, that many prophetis and kyngis wolden haue seie tho thingis, that ye seen, and thei sayn not; and here tho thingis, that ye heren, and thei herden not.
25382	42	10	25	And lo! a wise man of the lawe ros vp, temptynge hym, and seiynge, Maister, what thing schal Y do to haue euerlastynge lijf?
25383	42	10	26	And he seide to hym, What is writun in the lawe? hou redist thou?
25384	42	10	27	He answeride, and seide, Thou schalt loue thi Lord God of al thin herte, and of al thi soule, and of alle thi strengthis, and of al thi mynde; and thi neiybore as thi silf.
25385	42	10	28	And Jhesus seide to hym, Thou hast answerid riytli; do this thing, and thou schalt lyue.
25386	42	10	29	But he willynge to iustifie hym silf, seide to Jhesu, And who is my neiybore?
25387	42	10	30	And Jhesu biheld, and seide, A man cam doun fro Jerusalem in to Jerico, and fel among theues, and thei robbiden hym, and woundiden hym, and wente awei, and leften the man half alyue.
25388	42	10	31	And it bifel, that a prest cam doun the same weie, and passide forth, whanne he hadde seyn hym.
25389	42	10	32	Also a dekene, whanne he was bisidis the place, and saiy him, passide forth.
25390	42	10	33	But a Samaritan, goynge the weie, cam bisidis hym; and he siy hym, and hadde reuthe on hym;
25391	42	10	34	and cam to hym, and boond togidir hise woundis, and helde in oyle and wynne; and leide hym on his beest, and ledde in to an ostrie, and dide the cure of hym.
25392	42	10	35	And another dai he brouyte forth twey pans, and yaf to the ostiler, and seide, Haue the cure of hym; and what euer thou schalt yyue ouer, Y schal yelde to thee, whanne Y come ayen.
25393	42	10	36	Who of these thre, semeth to thee, was neiybore to hym, that fel among theues?
25394	42	10	37	And he seide, He that dide merci in to hym. And Jhesus seide to hym, Go thou, and do thou on lijk maner.
25395	42	10	38	And it was don, while thei wenten, he entride in to a castel; and a womman, Martha bi name, resseyuede hym in to hir hous.
25396	42	10	39	And to this was a sistir, Marie bi name, which also sat bisidis the feet of the Lord, and herde his word.
25397	42	10	40	But Martha bisiede aboute the ofte seruyce. And sche stood, and seide, Lord, takist thou no kepe, that my sistir hath left me aloone to serue? therfor seie thou to hir, that sche helpe me.
25398	42	10	41	And the Lord answerde, and seide to hir, Martha, Martha, thou art bysi, and art troublid aboute ful many thingis;
25399	42	10	42	but o thing is necessarie.
25400	42	10	43	Marie hath chosun the best part, which schal not be takun awei fro hir.
25401	42	11	1	And it was don, whanne he was preiynge in a place, as he ceesside, oon of hise disciplis seide to hym, Lord, teche vs to preye, as Joon tauyte hise disciplis.
25402	42	11	2	And he seide to hem, Whanne ye preien, seie ye, Fadir, halewid be thi name. Thi kyngdom come to.
25403	42	11	3	Yyue `to vs to dai oure ech daies breed.
25404	42	11	4	And foryyue to vs oure synnes, as we foryyuen to ech man that owith to vs. And lede vs not in to temptacioun.
25405	42	11	5	And he seide to hem, Who of you schal haue a freend, and schal go to hym at mydnyyt, and schal seie to hym, Freend, leene to me thre looues;
25406	42	11	6	for my freend cometh to me fro the weie, and Y haue not what Y schal sette bifor hym.
25407	42	11	7	And he with ynforth answere and seie, Nyle thou be heuy to me; the dore is now schit, and my children ben with me in bed; Y may not rise, and yyue to thee.
25408	42	11	8	And if he schal dwelle stil knockynge, Y seie to you, thouy he schal not rise, and yyue to him, for that that he is his freend, netheles for his contynuel axyng he schal ryse, and yyue to hym, as many as he hath nede to.
25409	42	11	9	And Y seie to you, axe ye, and it schal be youun to you; seke ye, and ye schulen fynde; knocke ye, and it schal be openyd to you.
25410	42	11	10	For ech that axith, takith, and he that sekith, fyndith; and to a man that knockith, it schal be openyd.
25411	42	11	11	Therfor who of you axith his fadir breed, whether he schal yyue hym a stoon? or if he axith fisch, whether he schal yyue hym a serpent for the fisch?
25412	42	11	12	or if he axe an eye, whether he schal a reche hym a scorpioun?
25413	42	11	13	Therfor if ye, whanne ye ben yuel, kunnen yyue good yiftis to youre children, hou myche more youre fadir of heuene schal yyue a good spirit to men that axith him.
25414	42	11	14	And Jhesus was castynge out a feend, and he was doumbe. And whanne he hadde cast out the feend, the doumbe man spak; and the puple wondride.
25415	42	11	15	And sum of hem seiden, In Belsabub, prince of deuelis, he castith out deuelis.
25416	42	11	16	And othir temptinge axiden of hym a tokene fro heuene.
25417	42	11	17	And as he saiy the thouytis of hem, he seide to hem, Euery rewme departid ayens it silf, schal be desolat, and an hous schal falle on an hous.
25418	42	11	18	And if Sathanas be departid ayens hym silf, hou schal his rewme stonde? For ye seien, that Y caste out feendis in Belsabub.
25419	42	11	19	And if Y in Belsabub caste out fendis, in whom casten out youre sones? Therfor thei schulen be youre domesmen.
25420	42	11	20	But if Y caste out fendis in the fyngir of God, thanne the rewme of God is comun among you.
25421	42	11	21	Whanne a strong armed man kepith his hous, alle thingis that he weldith ben in pees.
25422	42	11	22	But if a stronger than he come vpon hym, and ouercome hym, he schal take awei al his armere, in which he tristide, and schal dele abrood his robries.
25423	42	11	23	He that is not with me, is ayens me; and he that gederith not togidir with me, scaterith abrood.
25424	42	11	24	Whanne an vnclene spirit goith out of a man, he wandrith bi drie placis, and sekith reste; and he fyndynge not, seith, Y schal turne ayen in to myn hous, fro whannes Y cam out.
25425	42	11	25	And whanne he cometh, he fyndith it clansid with besyms, and fayre arayed.
25426	42	11	26	Thanne he goith, and takith with hym seuene othere spirits worse than hym silf, and thei entren, and dwellen there. And the laste thingis of that man ben maad worse than the formere.
25427	42	11	27	And it was don, whanne he hadde seid these thingis, a womman of the cumpanye reride hir vois, and seide to hym, Blessid be the wombe that bare thee, and blessid be the tetis that thou hast soken.
25428	42	11	28	And he seide, But yhe blessid be thei, that heren the word of God, and kepen it.
25429	42	11	29	And whanne the puple runnen togidere, he bigan to seie, This generacioun is a weiward generacioun; it sekith a token, and a tokene schal not be youun to it, but the tokene of Jonas, the profete.
25430	42	11	30	For as Jonas was a tokene to men of Nynyue, so mannus sone schal be to this generacioun.
25431	42	11	31	The queen of the south schal rise in doom with men of this generacioun, and schal condempne hem; for sche cam fro the endis of the erthe, for to here the wisdom of Salomon, and lo! here is a gretter than Salomon.
25432	42	11	32	Men of Nynyue schulen rise in doom with this generacioun, and schulen condempne it; for thei diden penaunce in the prechyng of Jonas, and lo! here is a gretter than Jonas.
25433	42	11	33	No man tendith a lanterne, and puttith in hidils, nether vndur a buyschel, but on a candilstike, that thei that goen in, se liyt.
25434	42	11	34	The lanterne of thi bodi is thin iye; if thin iye be symple, al thi bodi schal be liyti; but if it be weyward, al thi bodi schal be derkful.
25435	42	11	35	Therfor se thou, lest the liyt that is in thee, be derknessis.
25436	42	11	36	Therfor if al thi bodi be briyt, and haue no part of derknessis, it schal be al briyt, and as a lanterne of briytnesse it schal yyue liyt to thee.
25437	42	11	37	And whanne he spak, a Farisee preiede him, that he schulde ete with hym. And he entride, and sat to the meete.
25438	42	11	38	And the Farisee bigan to seie, gessynge with ynne hym silf, whi he was not waschen bifor mete.
25439	42	11	39	And the Lord seide to hym, Now ye Farisees clensen that that is with outenforth of the cuppe and the plater; but that thing that is with ynne of you, is ful of raueyn and wickidnesse.
25440	42	11	40	Foolis, whether he that made that that is withoutenforth, made not also that that is with ynne?
25441	42	11	41	Netheles that that is ouer plus, yyue ye almes, and lo! alle thingis ben cleene to you.
25442	42	11	42	But wo to you, Farisees, that tithen mynte, and rue, and ech eerbe, and leeuen doom and the charite of God. For it bihofte to do these thingis, and not leeue tho.
25443	42	11	43	Wo to you, Farisees, that louen the firste chaieris in synagogis, and salutaciouns in chepyng.
25444	42	11	44	Wo to you, that ben as sepulcris, that ben not seyn, and men walkynge aboue witen not.
25445	42	11	45	But oon of the wise men of the lawe answeride, and seide to hym, Maystir, thou seiynge these thingis, also to vs doist dispit.
25446	42	11	46	And he seide, Also wo to you, wise men of lawe, for ye chargen men with birthuns which thei moun not bere, and ye you silf with youre o fyngur touchen not the heuynessis.
25447	42	11	47	Wo to you, that bilden toumbis of profetis; and youre fadris slowen hem.
25448	42	11	48	Treuli ye witnessen, that ye consenten to the werkis of youre fadris; for thei slowen hem, but ye bilden her sepulcris.
25449	42	11	49	Therfor the wisdom of God seide, Y schal sende to hem profetis and apostlis, and of hem thei schulen sle and pursue,
25450	42	11	50	that the blood of alle prophetis, that was sched fro the making of the world, be souyt of this generacioun;
25451	42	11	51	fro the blood of the iust Abel to the blood of Zacharie, that was slayn bitwixe the auter and the hous. So Y seie to you, it schal be souyt of this generacioun.
25452	42	11	52	Wo to you, wise men of the lawe, for ye han takun awei the keye of kunnyng; and ye yow silf entriden not, and ye han forbeden hem that entriden.
25453	42	11	53	And whanne he seide these thingis to hem, the Farisees and wise men of lawe bigunnen greuousli to ayenstonde, and stoppe his mouth of many thingis,
25454	42	11	54	aspiynge hym, and sekynge to take sum thing of his mouth, to accuse hym.
25455	42	12	1	And whanne myche puple stood aboute, so that thei treden ech on othir, he bigan to seie to hise disciplis, Be ye war of the sourdouy of the Farisees, that is ypocrisie.
25456	42	12	2	For no thing is hilid, that schal not be schewid; nether hid, that schal not be wist.
25457	42	12	3	For whi tho thingis that ye han seid in derknessis, schulen be seid in liyt; and that that ye han spokun in eere in the couchis, schal be prechid in roofes.
25458	42	12	4	And Y seie to you, my freendis, be ye not a ferd of hem that sleen the bodie, and aftir these thingis han no more what thei schulen do.
25459	42	12	5	But Y schal schewe to you, whom ye schulen drede; drede ye hym, that aftir he hath slayn, he hath power to sende in to helle. And so Y seie to you, drede ye hym.
25460	42	12	6	Whether fyue sparowis ben not seld for twei halpens; and oon of hem is not in foryetyng bifor God?
25461	42	12	7	But also alle the heeris of youre heed ben noumbrid. Therfor nyle ye drede; ye ben of more prijs than many sparowis.
25462	42	12	8	Treuli Y seie to you, ech man that knoulechith me bifor men, mannus sone schal knouleche hym bifor the aungels of God.
25463	42	12	9	But he that denyeth me bifor men, schal be denyed bifor the aungels of God.
25464	42	12	10	And ech that seith a word ayens mannus sone, it schal be foryouun to hym; but it schal not be foryouun to hym, that blasfemeth ayens the Hooli Goost.
25465	42	12	11	And whanne thei leden you in to synagogis, and to magistratis, and potestatis, nyle ye `be bisie, hou or what ye schulen answere, or what ye schulen seie.
25466	42	12	12	For the Hooli Goost schal teche you in that our, what it bihoueth you to seie.
25467	42	12	13	And oon of the puple seide to hym, Maystir, seie to my brothir, that he departe with me the eritage.
25468	42	12	14	And he seyde to hym, Man, who ordeynede me a domesman, or a departere, on you?
25469	42	12	15	And he seide to hem, Se ye, and be ye war of al coueytice; for the lijf of a man is not in the abundaunce of tho thingis, whiche he weldith.
25470	42	12	16	And he tolde to hem a liknesse, and seide, The feeld of a riche man brouyte forth plenteuouse fruytis.
25471	42	12	17	And he thouyte with ynne hym silf, and seide, What schal Y do, for Y haue not whidur Y schal gadere my fruytis?
25472	42	12	18	And he seith, This thing Y schal do; Y schal throwe doun my bernes, and Y schal make gretter, and thidir Y schal gadir alle thingis that growen to me, and my goodis.
25473	42	12	19	And Y schal seie to my soule, Soule, thou hast many goodis kept in to ful many yeeris; rest thou, ete, drynke, and make feeste.
25474	42	12	20	And God seide to hym, Fool, in this nyyt thei schulen take thi lijf fro thee. And whos schulen tho thingis be, that thou hast arayed?
25475	42	12	21	So is he that tresourith to hym silf, and is not riche in God.
25476	42	12	22	And he seide to hise disciplis, Therfor Y seie to you, nyle ye be bisy to youre lijf, what ye schulen ete, nether to youre bodi, with what ye schulen be clothid.
25477	42	12	23	The lijf is more than mete, and the body more than clothing.
25478	42	12	24	Biholde ye crowis, for thei sowen not, nethir repen, to whiche is no celer, ne berne, and God fedith hem. Hou myche more ye ben of more prijs than thei.
25479	42	12	25	And who of you bithenkynge may put to o cubit to his stature?
25480	42	12	26	Therfor if ye moun not that that is leest, what ben ye bisie of othere thingis?
25481	42	12	27	Biholde ye the lilies of the feeld, hou thei wexen; thei trauelen not, nethir spynnen. And Y seie to you, that nethir Salomon in al his glorie was clothid as oon of these.
25482	42	12	28	And if God clothith thus the hey, that to dai is in the feeld, and to morewe is cast in to an ouen; hou myche more you of litil feith.
25483	42	12	29	And nyle ye seke, what ye schulen ete, or what ye schulen drynke; and nyle ye be reisid an hiy.
25484	42	12	30	For folkis of the world seken alle these thingis; `and your fadir woot, that ye neden alle these thingis.
25485	42	12	31	Netheles seke ye first the kyngdom of God, and alle these thingis schulen be caste to you.
25486	42	12	32	Nile ye, litil flok, drede, for it pleside to youre fadir to yyue you a kyngdom.
25487	42	12	33	Selle ye tho thingis that ye han in possessioun, and yyue ye almes. And make to you sachels that wexen not oolde, tresoure that failith not in heuenes, whidir a theef neiyith not, nether mouyt destruyeth.
25488	42	12	34	For where is thi tresoure, there thin herte schal be.
25489	42	12	35	Be youre leendis gird aboue, and lanternes brennynge in youre hoondis;
25490	42	12	36	and be ye lijk to men that abiden her lord, whanne he schal turne ayen fro the weddyngis, that whanne he schal come, and knocke, anoon thei openen to hym.
25491	42	12	37	Blessid be tho seruauntis, that whanne the lord schal come, he schal fynde wakynge. Treuli Y seie to you, that he schal girde hym silf, and make hem sitte to mete, and he schal go, and serue hem.
25492	42	12	38	And if he come in the secounde wakynge, and if he come in the thridde wakynge, and fynde so, tho seruauntis ben blessid.
25493	42	12	39	And wite ye this thing, for if an hosebonde man wiste, in what our the theef wolde come, sotheli he schulde wake, and not suffre his hous to be myned.
25494	42	12	40	And be ye redi, for in what our ye gessen not, mannus sone schal come.
25495	42	12	41	And Petre seide to hym, Lord, seist thou this parable to vs, or to alle?
25496	42	12	42	And the Lord seide, Who, gessist thou, is a trewe dispendere, and a prudent, whom the lord hath ordeyned on his meyne, to yyue hem in tyme mesure of whete?
25497	42	12	43	Blessid is that seruaunt, that the lord whanne he cometh, schal fynde so doynge.
25498	42	12	44	Verili Y seie to you, that on alle thingis that he weldith, he schal ordeyne hym.
25499	42	12	45	That if that seruaunt seie in his herte, My lord tarieth to come; and bigynne to smyte children, and handmaydenes, and ete, and drynke, and be fulfillid ouer mesure,
25500	42	12	46	the lord of that seruaunt schal come, in the dai that he hopith not, and the our that he woot not; and schal departe hym, and putte his part with vnfeithful men.
25501	42	12	47	But thilke seruaunt that knew the wille of his lord, and made not hym redi, and dide not aftir his wille, schal be betun with many betyngis.
25502	42	12	48	But he that knew not, and dide worthi thingis of strokis, schal be betun with fewe. For to eche man to whom myche is youun, myche schal be axid of hym; and thei schulen axe more of hym, to whom thei bitoken myche.
25503	42	12	49	Y cam to sende fier `in to the erthe, and what wole Y, but that it be kyndlid?
25504	42	12	50	And Y haue to be baptisid with a baptysm, and hou am Y constreyned, til that it be perfitli don?
25505	42	12	51	Wene ye, that Y cam to yyue pees in to erthe? Nay, Y say to you, but departyng.
25506	42	12	52	For fro this tyme ther schulen be fyue departid in oon hous; thre schulen be departid ayens tweyne, and tweyne schulen be departid ayens thre;
25507	42	12	53	the fadir ayens the sone, and the sone ayens the fadir; the modir ayens the douytir, and the douytir ayens the modir; the hosebondis modir ayens the sones wijf, and and the sones wijf ayens hir hosebondis modir.
25508	42	12	54	And he seide also to the puple, Whanne ye seen a cloude risynge fro the sunne goynge doun, anoon ye seien, Reyn cometh; and so it is don.
25509	42	12	55	And whanne ye seen the south blowynge, ye seien, That heete schal be; and it is don.
25510	42	12	56	Ypocritis, ye kunnen preue the face of heuene and of erthe, but hou preuen ye not this tyme.
25511	42	12	57	But what and of you silf ye demen not that that is iust?
25512	42	12	58	But whanne thou goist with thin aduersarie in the weie to the prince, do bisynesse to be delyuerid fro hym; lest perauenture he take thee to the domesman, and the domesman bitake thee to the maistirful axer, and the maistirful axer sende thee in to prisoun.
25513	42	12	59	Y seie to thee, thou schalt not go fro thennus, til thou yelde the laste ferthing.
25514	42	13	1	And sum men weren present in that tyme, that telden to hym of the Galileis, whos blood Pilat myngide with the sacrificis of hem.
25515	42	13	2	And he answeride, and seide to hem, Wenen ye, that these men of Galile weren synneris more than alle Galilees, for thei suffriden siche thingis?
25516	42	13	3	Y seie to you, nay; alle ye schulen perische in lijk manere, but ye han penaunce.
25517	42	13	4	And as tho eiytetene, on which the toure in Siloa fel doun, and slowe hem, gessen ye, for thei weren dettouris more than alle men that dwellen in Jerusalem?
25518	42	13	5	Y seie to you, nai; but also `ye alle schulen perische, if ye doon not penaunce.
25519	42	13	6	And he seide this liknesse, A man hadde a fige tre plauntid in his vynyerd, and he cam sekynge fruyt in it, and foond noon.
25520	42	13	7	And he seide to the tilier of the vynyerd, Lo! thre yeeris ben, sithen Y come sekynge fruyt in this fige tre, and Y fynde noon; therfor kitte it doun, whereto ocupieth it the erthe?
25521	42	13	8	And he answerynge seide to hym, Lord, suffre it also this yeer, the while Y delue aboute it, and Y schal donge it;
25522	42	13	9	if it schal make fruyt, if nay, in tyme comynge thou schalt kitte it doun.
25523	42	13	10	And he was techinge in her synagoge in the sabatis.
25524	42	13	11	And lo! a womman, that hadde a spirit of sijknesse eiytene yeeris, and was crokid, and `nethir ony maner myyte loke vpward.
25525	42	13	12	Whom whanne Jhesus hadde seyn, he clepide to hym, and seide to hir, Womman, thou art delyuerid of thi sijknesse.
25526	42	13	13	And he settide on hir his hoondis, and anoon sche stood upriyt, and glorifiede God.
25527	42	13	14	And the prince of the synagoge answerde, hauynge dedeyn for Jhesus hadde heelid in the sabat; and he seide to the puple, Ther ben sixe dayes, in whiche it bihoueth to worche; therfor come ye in these, and `be ye heelid, and not in the daie of sabat.
25528	42	13	15	But the Lord answeride to hym, and seide, Ypocrite, whether ech of you vntieth not in the sabat his oxe, or asse, fro the cratche, and ledith to watir?
25529	42	13	16	Bihofte it not this douytir of Abraham, whom Satanas hath boundun, lo! eiytetene yeeris, to be vnboundun of this boond in the dai of the sabat?
25530	42	13	17	And whanne he seide these thingis, alle hise aduersaries weren aschamed, and al the puple ioiede in alle thingis, that weren gloriousli don of hym.
25531	42	13	18	Therfor he seide, To what thing is the kyngdom of God lijk? and to what thing schal Y gesse it to be lijk?
25532	42	13	19	It is lijk to a corn of seneuey, which a man took, and cast in to his yerd; and it wax, and was maad in to a greet tree, and foulis of the eire restiden in the braunchis therof.
25533	42	13	20	And eft soone he seide, To what thing schal Y gesse the kyngdom of God lijk?
25534	42	13	21	It is lijk to sourdouy, that a womman took, and hidde it `in to thre mesuris of mele, til al were sourid.
25535	42	13	22	And he wente bi citees and castels, techynge and makynge a iourney in to Jerusalem.
25536	42	13	23	And a man seide to hym, Lord, if there ben fewe, that ben saued? And he seide to hem,
25537	42	13	24	Stryue ye to entre bi the streite yate; for Y seie to you, many seken to entre, and thei schulen not mowe.
25538	42	13	25	For whanne the hosebonde man is entrid, and the dore is closid, ye schulen bigynne to stonde with out forth, and knocke at the dore, and seie, Lord, opyn to vs. And he schal answere, and seie to you, Y knowe you not, of whennus ye ben.
25539	42	13	26	Thanne ye schulen bigynne to seye, We han etun bifor thee and drunkun, and in oure streetis thou hast tauyt.
25540	42	13	27	And he schal seie to you, Y know you not, of whennus ye ben; go awei fro me, alle ye worcheris of wickidnesse.
25541	42	13	28	There schal be wepyng and gruntyng of teeth, whanne ye schulen se Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and alle the prophetis in the kyngdom of God; and you to be put out.
25542	42	13	29	And thei schulen come fro the eest and west, and fro the north and south, and schulen sitte `at the mete in the rewme of God.
25543	42	13	30	And lo! thei that weren the firste, ben the laste; and thei that weren the laste, ben the firste.
25544	42	13	31	In that day sum of the Farisees camen nyy, and seiden to hym, Go out, and go fro hennus, for Eroude wole sle thee.
25545	42	13	32	And he seide to hem, Go ye, and seie to that foxe, Lo! Y caste out feendis, and Y make perfitli heelthis, to dai and to morew, and the thridde dai Y am endid.
25546	42	13	33	Netheles it bihoueth me to dai, and to morewe, and the dai that sueth, to walke; for it fallith not a profete to perische out of Jerusalem.
25547	42	13	34	Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that sleest profetis, and stonest hem that ben sent to thee, hou ofte wolde Y gadre togider thi sones, as a brid gaderith his nest vndur fethris, and thou woldist not.
25548	42	13	35	Lo! youre hous schal be left to you desert. And Y seie to you, that ye schulen not se me, til it come, whanne ye schulen seie, Blessid is he, that cometh in the name of the Lord.
25549	42	14	1	And it was don, whanne he hadde entrid in to the hous of a prince of Farisees, in the sabat, to ete breed, thei aspieden hym.
25550	42	14	2	And lo! a man sijk in the dropesie was bifor hym.
25551	42	14	3	And Jhesus answerynge spak to the wise men of lawe, and to the Farisees, and seide, Whethir it is leeueful to heele in the sabat?
25552	42	14	4	And thei helden pees. And Jhesus took, and heelide hym, and let hym go.
25553	42	14	5	And he answeride to hem, and seide, Whos asse or oxe of you schal falle in to a pit, and `he schal not anoon drawe hym out in the dai of the sabat?
25554	42	14	6	And thei myyten not answere to hym to these thingis.
25555	42	14	7	He seide also a parable to men bodun to a feeste, and biheld hou thei chesen the first sittyng placis, and seide to hem,
25556	42	14	8	Whanne thou art bodun to bridalis, sitte not `at the mete in the firste place; lest perauenture a worthier than thou be bodun of hym,
25557	42	14	9	and lest he come that clepide thee and hym, and seie to thee, Yyue place to this, and thanne thou schalt bigynne with schame to holde the lowest place.
25558	42	14	10	But whanne thou art bedun to a feste, go, and sitte doun in the laste place, that whanne he cometh, that bad thee to the feeste, he seie to thee, Freend, come hiyer. Thanne worschip schal be to thee, bifor men that sitten at the mete.
25559	42	14	11	For ech that enhaunsith hym, schal be lowid; and he that meketh hym, schal be hiyed.
25560	42	14	12	And he seide to hym, that hadde bodun hym to the feeste, Whanne thou makist a mete, or a soper, nyle thou clepe thi freendis, nether thi britheren, nethir cosyns, nethir neiyboris, ne riche men; lest perauenture thei bidde thee ayen to the feeste, and it be yolde ayen to thee.
25561	42	14	13	But whanne thou makist a feeste, clepe pore men,
25562	42	14	14	feble, crokid, and blynde, and thou schalt be blessid; for thei han not wherof to yelde thee, for it schal be yoldun to thee in the risyng ayen of iust men.
25563	42	14	15	And whanne oon of hem that saten togider at the mete hadde herd these thingis, he seide to hym, Blessid is he, that schal ete breed in the rewme of God.
25564	42	14	16	And he seide to hym, A man made a greet soper, and clepide many.
25565	42	14	17	And he sent his seruaunt in the our of soper, to seie to men that weren bodun to the feeste, that thei schulden come, for now alle thingis ben redi.
25566	42	14	18	And alle bigunnen togidir to excusen hem. The firste seide, Y haue bouyt a toun, and Y haue nede to go out, and se it; Y preye thee, haue me excusid.
25567	42	14	19	And the tother seide, Y haue bouyt fyue yockis of oxun, and Y go to preue hem; Y preye thee, haue me excusid.
25568	42	14	20	And an othir seide, Y haue weddid a wijf; and therfor Y may not come.
25569	42	14	21	And the seruaunt turnede ayen, and tolde these thingis to his lord. Thanne the hosebonde man was wrooth, and seide to his seruaunt, Go out swithe in to the grete stretis and smal stretis of the citee, and brynge ynne hidir pore men, and feble, blynde, and crokid.
25570	42	14	22	And the seruaunt seide, Lord, it is don, as thou hast comaundid, and yit there is a void place.
25571	42	14	23	And the lord seide to the seruaunt, Go out in to weies and heggis, and constreine men to entre, that myn hous be fulfillid.
25572	42	14	24	For Y seie to you, that noon of tho men that ben clepid, schal taaste my soper.
25573	42	14	25	And myche puple wenten with hym; and he turnede, and seide to hem,
25574	42	14	26	If ony man cometh to me, and hatith not his fadir, and modir, and wijf, and sones, and britheren, and sistris, and yit his owne lijf, he may not be my disciple.
25575	42	14	27	And he that berith not his cross, and cometh aftir me, may not be my disciple.
25576	42	14	28	For who of you willynge to bilde a toure, whether he `first sitte not, and countith the spensis that ben nedeful, if he haue to perfourme?
25577	42	14	29	Lest aftir that he hath set the foundement, and mowe not perfourme, alle that seen, bigynnen to scorne hym, and seie, For this man bigan to bilde,
25578	42	14	30	and myyte not make an ende.
25579	42	14	31	Or what kyng that wole go to do a bataile ayens anothir kyng, whether he sittith not first, and bithenkith, if he may with ten thousynde go ayens hym that cometh ayens hym with twenti thousynde?
25580	42	14	32	Ellis yit while he is afer, he sendynge a messanger, preieth tho thingis that ben of pees.
25581	42	14	33	So therfor ech of you, that forsakith not alle thingis that he hath, may not be my disciple.
25582	42	14	34	Salt is good; but if salt vanysche, in what thing schal it be sauerid?
25583	42	14	35	Nethir in erthe, nethir in donghille it is profitable, but it schal be cast out. He that hath eeris of herynge, here he.
25584	42	15	1	And pupplicans and synful men weren neiyynge to him, to here hym.
25585	42	15	2	And the Farisees and scribis grutchiden, seiynge, For this resseyueth synful men, and etith with hem.
25586	42	15	3	And he spak to hem this parable,
25587	42	15	4	and seide, What man of you that hath an hundrith scheep, and if he hath lost oon of hem, whethir he leeueth not nynti and nyne in desert, and goith to it that perischide, til he fynde it?
25588	42	15	5	And whanne he hath foundun it, he ioieth, and leyith it on hise schuldris; and he cometh hoom,
25589	42	15	6	and clepith togidir hise freendis and neiyboris, and seith to hem, Be ye glad with me, for Y haue founde my scheep, that hadde perischid.
25590	42	15	7	And Y seie to you, so ioye schal be in heuene on o synful man doynge penaunce, more than on nynti and nyne iuste, that han no nede to penaunce.
25591	42	15	8	Or what womman hauynge ten besauntis, and if sche hath lost oo besaunt, whether sche teendith not a lanterne, and turneth vpsodoun the hows, and sekith diligentli, til that sche fynde it?
25592	42	15	9	And whanne sche hath foundun, sche clepith togidir freendis and neiyboris, and seith, Be ye glad with me, for Y haue founde the besaunt, that Y hadde lost.
25593	42	15	10	So Y seie to you, ioye schal be bifor aungels of God on o synful man doynge penaunce.
25594	42	15	11	And he seide, A man hadde twei sones;
25595	42	15	12	and the yonger of hem seide to the fadir, Fadir, yyue me the porcioun of catel, that fallith to me. And he departide to hem the catel.
25596	42	15	13	And not aftir many daies, whanne alle thingis weren gederid togider, the yonger sone wente forth in pilgrymage in to a fer cuntre; and there he wastide hise goodis in lyuynge lecherously.
25597	42	15	14	And aftir that he hadde endid alle thingis, a strong hungre was maad in that cuntre, and he bigan to haue nede.
25598	42	15	15	And he wente, and drouy hym to oon of the citeseyns of that cuntre. And he sente hym in to his toun, to fede swyn.
25599	42	15	16	And he coueitide to fille his wombe of the coddis that the hoggis eeten, and no man yaf hym.
25600	42	15	17	And he turnede ayen to hym silf, and seide, Hou many hirid men in my fadir hous han plente of looues; and Y perische here thorouy hungir.
25601	42	15	18	Y schal rise vp, and go to my fadir, and Y schal seie to hym, Fadir, Y haue synned in to heuene, and bifor thee;
25602	42	15	19	and now Y am not worthi to be clepid thi sone, make me as oon of thin hirid men.
25603	42	15	20	And he roos vp, and cam to his fadir. And whanne he was yit afer, his fadir saiy hym, and was stirrid bi mercy. And he ran, and fel on his necke, and kisside hym.
25604	42	15	21	And the sone seide to hym, Fadir, Y haue synned in to heuene, and bifor thee; and now Y am not worthi to be clepid thi sone.
25605	42	15	22	And the fadir seide to hise seruauntis, Swithe brynge ye forth the firste stoole, and clothe ye hym, and yyue ye a ryng in his hoond,
25606	42	15	23	and schoon on hise feet; and brynge ye a fat calf, and sle ye, and ete we, and make we feeste.
25607	42	15	24	For this my sone was deed, and hath lyued ayen; he perischid, and is foundun. And alle men bigunnen to ete.
25608	42	15	25	But his eldere sone was in the feeld; and whanne he cam, and neiyede to the hous, he herde a symfonye and a croude.
25609	42	15	26	And he clepide oon of the seruauntis, and axide, what these thingis weren.
25610	42	15	27	And he seide to hym, Thi brother is comun, and thi fadir slewe a fat calf, for he resseyuede hym saaf.
25611	42	15	28	And he was wrooth, and wolde not come in. Therfor his fadir wente out, and bigan to preye hym.
25612	42	15	29	And he answerde to his fadir, and seide, Lo! so many yeeris Y serue thee, and Y neuer brak thi comaundement; and thou neuer yaf to me a kidde, that Y with my freendis schulde haue ete.
25613	42	15	30	But aftir that this thi sone, that hath deuourid his substaunce with horis, cam, thou hast slayn to hym a fat calf.
25614	42	15	31	And he seide to hym, Sone, thou art euer more with me, and alle my thingis ben thine.
25615	42	15	32	But it bihofte for to make feeste, and to haue ioye; for this thi brother was deed, and lyuede ayen; he perischide, and is foundun.
25616	42	16	1	He seide also to hise disciplis, Ther was a riche man, that hadde a baili; and this was defamed to him, as he hadde wastid his goodis.
25617	42	16	2	And he clepide hym, and seide to hym, What here Y this thing of thee? yelde reckynyng of thi baili, for thou miyte not now be baili.
25618	42	16	3	And the baili seide with ynne him silf, What schal Y do, for my lord takith awei fro me the baili? delfe mai Y not, I schame to begge.
25619	42	16	4	Y woot what Y schal do, that whanne Y am remeued fro the baili, thei resseyue me in to her hous.
25620	42	16	5	Therfor whanne alle the dettours of his lord weren clepid togider, he seide to the firste, Hou myche owist thou to my lord?
25621	42	16	6	And he seide, An hundrid barelis of oyle. And he seide to hym, Take thi caucioun, and sitte soone, and write fifti.
25622	42	16	7	Aftirward he seide to another, And hou myche owist thou? Which answerde, An hundrid coris of whete. And he seide to hym, Take thi lettris, and write foure scoore.
25623	42	16	8	And the lord preiside the baili of wickydnesse, for he hadde do prudentli; for the sones of this world ben more prudent in her generacioun than the sones of liyt.
25624	42	16	9	And Y seie to you, make ye to you freendis of the ritchesse of wickidnesse, that whanne ye schulen fayle, thei resseyue you in to euerlastynge tabernaclis.
25625	42	16	10	He that is trewe in the leeste thing, is trewe also in the more; and he that is wickid in a litil thing, is wickid also in the more.
25626	42	16	11	Therfor if ye weren not trewe in the wickid thing of ritchesse, who schal bitake to you that that is verry?
25627	42	16	12	And if ye weren not trewe in othere mennus thing, who schal yyue to you that that is youre?
25628	42	16	13	No seruaunt may serue to twei lordis; for ether he schal hate `the toon, and loue the tothir; ethir he schal drawe to `the toon, and schal dispise the tothir. Ye moun not serue to God and to ritchesse.
25629	42	16	14	But the Farisees, that weren coueytous, herden alle these thingis, and thei scorneden hym.
25630	42	16	15	And he seide to hem, Ye it ben, that iustifien you bifor men; but God hath knowun youre hertis, for that that is hiy to men, is abhomynacioun bifor God.
25631	42	16	16	The lawe and prophetis til to Joon; fro that tyme the rewme of God is euangelisid, and ech man doith violence in to it.
25632	42	16	17	Forsothe it is liyter heuene and erthe to passe, than that o titil falle fro the lawe.
25633	42	16	18	Euery man that forsakith his wijf, and weddith an other, doith letcherie; and he that weddith the wijf forsakun of the hosebonde, doith auowtrie.
25634	42	16	19	There was a riche man, and was clothid in purpur, and whit silk, and eete euery dai schynyngli.
25635	42	16	20	And there was a begger, Lazarus bi name, that lai at his yate ful of bilis,
25636	42	16	21	and coueitide to be fulfillid of the crummes, that fellen doun fro the riche mannus boord, and no man yaf to hym; but houndis camen, and lickiden hise bilis.
25637	42	16	22	And it was don, that the begger diede, and was borun of aungels in to Abrahams bosum.
25638	42	16	23	And the riche man was deed also, and was biried in helle. And he reiside hise iyen, whanne he was in turmentis, and say Abraham afer, and Lazarus in his bosum.
25639	42	16	24	And he criede, and seide, Fadir Abraham, haue merci on me, and sende Lazarus, that he dippe the ende of his fyngur in watir, to kele my tunge; for Y am turmentid in this flawme.
25640	42	16	25	And Abraham seide to hym, Sone, haue mynde, for thou hast resseyued good thingis in thi lijf, and Lazarus also yuel thingis; but he is now coumfortid, and thou art turmentid.
25641	42	16	26	And in alle these thingis a greet derk place is stablischid betwixe vs and you; that thei that wolen fro hennus passe to you, moun not, nethir fro thennus passe ouer hidur.
25642	42	16	27	And he seide, Thanne Y preie thee, fadir, that thou sende hym in to the hous of my fadir.
25643	42	16	28	For Y haue fyue britheren, that he witnesse to hem, lest also thei come in to this place of turmentis.
25644	42	16	29	And Abraham seide to him, Thei han Moyses and the prophetis; here thei hem.
25645	42	16	30	And he seide, Nay, fadir Abraham, but if ony of deed men go to hem, thei schulen do penaunce.
25646	42	16	31	And he seide to hym, If thei heren not Moises and prophetis, nethir if ony of deed men rise ayen, thei schulen bileue to hym.
25647	42	17	1	And Jhesu seide to hise disciplis, It is impossible that sclaundris come not; but wo to that man, bi whom thei comen.
25648	42	17	2	It is more profitable to him, if a mylne stoon be put aboute his necke, and he be cast in to the see, than that he sclaundre oon of these litle.
25649	42	17	3	Take ye hede you silf; if thi brothir hath synned ayens thee, blame hym; and if he do penaunce, foryyue hym.
25650	42	17	4	And if seuene sithis in the dai he do synne ayens thee, and seuene sithis in the dai he be conuertid to thee, and seie, It forthenkith me, foryyue thou hym.
25651	42	17	5	And the apostlis seiden to the Lord, Encrese to vs feith.
25652	42	17	6	And the Lord seide, If ye han feith as the corn of seneuei, ye schulen seie to this more tre, Be thou drawun vp bi the rote, and be ouerplauntid in to the see, and it schal obeie to you.
25653	42	17	7	But who of you hath a seruaunt erynge, or lesewynge oxis, which seith to hym, whanne he turneth ayen fro the feeld, Anoon go, and sitte to mete;
25654	42	17	8	and seith not to hym, Make redi, that Y soupe, and girde thee, and serue me, while Y ete and drynke, and aftir this thou schalt ete and drynke;
25655	42	17	9	whether he hath grace to that seruaunt, for he dide that that he comaundide hym?
25656	42	17	10	Nay, Y gesse. So ye, whanne ye han don alle thingis that ben comaundid to you, seie ye, We ben vnprofitable seruauntis, we han do that that we ouyten to do.
25657	42	17	11	And it was do, the while Jhesus wente in to Jerusalem, he passide thorou the myddis of Samarie, and Galilee.
25658	42	17	12	And whanne he entride in to a castel, ten leprouse men camen ayens hym, whiche stoden afer,
25659	42	17	13	and reiseden her voys, and seiden, Jhesu, comaundoure, haue merci on vs.
25660	42	17	14	And as he say hem, he seide, Go ye, `schewe ye you to the prestis. And it was don, the while thei wenten, thei weren clensid.
25661	42	17	15	And oon of hem, as he saiy that he was clensid, wente ayen, magnifiynge God with grete vois.
25662	42	17	16	And he fel doun on the face bifore hise feet, and dide thankyngis; and this was a Samaritan.
25663	42	17	17	And Jhesus answerde, and seide, Whether ten ben not clensid, and where ben the nyne?
25664	42	17	18	There is noon foundun, that turnede ayen, and yaf glorie to God, but this alien.
25665	42	17	19	And he seide to hym, Rise vp, go thou; for thi feith hath maad thee saaf.
25666	42	17	20	And he was axid of Farisees, whanne the rewme of God cometh. And he answerde to hem, and seide, The rewme of God cometh not with aspiyng,
25667	42	17	21	nether thei schulen seie, Lo! here, or lo there; for lo! the rewme of God is with ynne you.
25668	42	17	22	And he seide to hise disciplis, Daies schulen come, whanne ye schulen desire to se o dai of mannus sone, and ye schulen not se.
25669	42	17	23	And thei schulen seie to you, Lo! here, and lo there. Nyle ye go, nether sue ye;
25670	42	17	24	for as leyt schynynge from vndur heuene schyneth in to tho thingis that ben vndur heuene, so schal mannus sone be in his dai.
25671	42	17	25	But first it bihoueth hym to suffre many thingis, and to be repreued of this generacioun.
25672	42	17	26	And as it was doon in the daies of Noe, so it schal be in the daies of mannys sone.
25673	42	17	27	Thei eeten and drunkun, weddiden wyues, and weren youun to weddyngis, til in to the dai in the whych Noe entride in to the schip; and the greet flood cam, and loste alle.
25674	42	17	28	Also as it was don in the daies of Loth, thei eeten and drunkun, bouyten and seelden, plauntiden and bildiden; but the dai that Loth wente out of Sodome,
25675	42	17	29	the Lord reynede fier and brymstoon fro heuene, and loste alle.
25676	42	17	30	Lijk this thing it schal be, in what dai mannys sone schal be schewid.
25677	42	17	31	In that our he that is in the roof, and his vessels in the hous, come he not doun to take hem awei; and he that schal be in the feeld, also turne not ayen bihynde.
25678	42	17	32	Be ye myndeful of the wijf of Loth.
25679	42	17	33	Who euer seketh to make his lijf saaf, schal leese it; and who euer leesith it, schal quykene it.
25680	42	17	34	But Y seie to you, in that nyyt twei schulen be in o bed, oon schal be takun, and the tothir forsakun;
25681	42	17	35	twei wymmen schulen be gryndynge togidir, `the toon schal be takun, and `the tother forsakun; twei in a feeld, `the toon schal be takun, and `the tother left.
25682	42	17	36	Thei answeren, and seien to hym, Where, Lord?
25683	42	17	37	Which seide to hym, Where euer the bodi schal be, thidur schulen be gaderid togidere also the eglis.
25684	42	18	1	And he seide to hem also a parable, that it bihoueth to preye euer more, and not faile;
25685	42	18	2	and seide, There was a iuge in a citee, that dredde not God, nether schamede of men.
25686	42	18	3	And a widowe was in that citee, and sche cam to hym, and seide, Venge me of myn aduersarie;
25687	42	18	4	and he wolde not longe tyme. But aftir these thingis he seide with ynne hym silf, Thouy Y drede not God, and schame not of man,
25688	42	18	5	netheles for this widewe is heuy to me, Y schal venge hir; lest at the laste sche comynge condempne me.
25689	42	18	6	And the Lord seide, Here ye, what the domesman of wickidnesse seith;
25690	42	18	7	and whether God schal not do veniaunce of hise chosun, criynge to hym dai and nyyt, and schal haue pacience in hem?
25691	42	18	8	Sotheli Y seie to you, for soone he schal do veniaunce of hem. Netheles gessist thou, that mannus sone comynge schal fynde feith in erthe?
25692	42	18	9	And he seide also to sum men, that tristiden in hem silf, as thei weren riytful, and dispiseden othere, this parable,
25693	42	18	10	seiynge, Twei men wenten vp in to the temple to preye; the toon a Farisee, and the tother a pupplican.
25694	42	18	11	And the Farisee stood, and preiede bi hym silf these thingis, and seide, God, Y do thankyngis to thee, for Y am not as other men, raueinouris, vniust, auoutreris, as also this pupplican;
25695	42	18	12	Y faste twies in the woke, Y yyue tithis of alle thingis that Y haue in possessioun.
25696	42	18	13	And the pupplican stood afer, and wolde nether reise hise iyen to heuene, but smoot his brest, and seide, God be merciful to me, synnere.
25697	42	18	14	Treuli Y seie to you, this yede doun in to his hous, and was iustified fro the other. For ech that enhaunsith hym, schal be maad low, and he that mekith hym, schal be enhaunsid.
25698	42	18	15	And thei brouyten to hym yonge children, that he schulde touche hem; and whanne the disciplis saien this thing, thei blameden hem.
25699	42	18	16	But Jhesus clepide togider hem, and seide, Suffre ye children to come to me, and nyle ye forbede hem, for of siche is the kyngdom of heuenes.
25700	42	18	17	Treuli Y seie to you, who euer schal not take the kyngdom of God as a child, he schal not entre in to it.
25701	42	18	18	And a prince axide hym, and seide, Goode maister, in what thing doynge schal Y weilde euerlastynge lijf?
25702	42	18	19	And Jhesus seide to hym, What seist thou me good? No man is good, but God aloone.
25703	42	18	20	Thou knowist the comaundementis, Thou schalt not sle, Thou schalt not do letcherie, Thou schalt not do theft, Thou schalt not seie fals witnessyng, Worschipe thi fadir and thi modir.
25704	42	18	21	Which seide, Y haue kept alle these thingis fro my yongthe.
25705	42	18	22	And whanne this thing was herd, Jhesus seide to hym, Yit o thing failith `to thee; sille thou alle thingis that thou hast, and yyue to pore men, and thou schalt haue tresour in heuene; and come, and sue thou me.
25706	42	18	23	Whanne these thingis weren herd, he was soreful, for he was ful ryche.
25707	42	18	24	And Jhesus seynge hym maad sorie, seide, How hard thei that han money schulen entre in to the kyngdom of God;
25708	42	18	25	for it is liyter a camel to passe thorou a nedlis iye, than a riche man to entre in to the kyngdom of God.
25709	42	18	26	And thei that herden these thingis seiden, Who may be maad saaf?
25710	42	18	27	And he seide to hem, Tho thingis that ben impossible anentis men, ben possible anentis God.
25711	42	18	28	But Petir seide, Lo! we han left alle thingis, and han sued thee.
25712	42	18	29	And he seide to hym, Treuli Y seie to you, there is no man that schal forsake hous, or fadir, modir, or britheren, or wijf, or children, or feeldis, for the rewme of God,
25713	42	18	30	and schal not resseyue many mo thingis in this tyme, and in the world to comynge euerlastynge lijf.
25714	42	18	31	And Jhesus took hise twelue disciplis, and seide to hem, Lo! we gon vp to Jerusalem, and alle thingis schulen be endid, that ben writun bi the prophetis of mannus sone.
25715	42	18	32	For he schal be bitraied to hethen men, and he schal be scorned, and scourgid, and bispat;
25716	42	18	33	and aftir that thei han scourgid, thei schulen sle hym, and the thridde dai he schal rise ayen.
25717	42	18	34	And thei vndurstoden no thing of these; and this word was hid fro hem, and thei vndurstoden not tho thingis that weren seid.
25718	42	18	35	But it was don, whanne Jhesus cam nyy to Jerico, a blynde man sat bisidis the weie, and beggide.
25719	42	18	36	And whanne he herde the puple passynge, he axide, what this was.
25720	42	18	37	And thei seiden to hym, that Jhesus of Nazareth passide.
25721	42	18	38	And he criede, and seide, Jhesu, the sone of Dauyd, haue mercy on me.
25722	42	18	39	And thei that wenten bifor blamyden hym, that he schulde be stille; but he criede myche the more, Thou sone of Dauid, haue mercy on me.
25723	42	18	40	And Jhesus stood, and comaundide hym to be brouyt forth to hym. And whanne he cam nyy, he axide hym,
25724	42	18	41	and seide, What wolt thou that Y schal do to thee? And he seide, Lord, that Y se.
25725	42	18	42	And Jhesus seide to hym, Biholde; thi feith hath maad thee saaf.
25726	42	18	43	And anoon he say, and suede hym, and magnyfiede God. And al the puple, as it say, yaf heriyng to God.
25727	42	19	1	And Jhesus `goynge yn, walkide thorou Jericho.
25728	42	19	2	And lo! a man, Sache bi name, and this was a prince of pupplicans, and he was riche.
25729	42	19	3	And he souyte to se Jhesu, who he was, and he myyte not, for the puple, for he was litil in stature.
25730	42	19	4	And he ran bifore, and stiyede in to a sicomoure tree, to se hym; for he was to passe fro thennus.
25731	42	19	5	And Jhesus biheld vp, whanne he cam to the place, and saiy hym, and seide to hym, Sache, haste thee, and come doun, for to dai Y mot dwelle in thin hous.
25732	42	19	6	And he hiyynge cam doun, and ioiynge resseyuede hym.
25733	42	19	7	And whanne alle men sayn, thei grutchiden seiynge, For he hadde turned to a synful man.
25734	42	19	8	But Sache stood, and seide to the Lord, Lo! Lord, Y yyue the half of my good to pore men; and if Y haue ony thing defraudid ony man, Y yelde foure so myche.
25735	42	19	9	Jhesus seith to hym, For to dai heelthe is maad to this hous, for that he is Abrahams sone;
25736	42	19	10	for mannus sone cam to seke, and make saaf that thing that perischide.
25737	42	19	11	Whanne thei herden these thingis, he addide, and seide a parable, for that he was nyy Jerusalem, `and for thei gessiden, that anoon the kyngdom of God schulde be schewid.
25738	42	19	12	Therfor he seide, A worthi man wente in to a fer cuntre, to take to hym a kyngdom, and to turne ayen.
25739	42	19	13	And whanne hise ten seruauntis weren clepid, he yaf to hem ten besauntis; and seide to hem, Chaffare ye, til Y come.
25740	42	19	14	But hise citeseyns hatiden hym, and senten a messanger aftir hym, and seiden, We wolen not, that he regne on vs.
25741	42	19	15	And it was don, that he turnede ayen, whan he hadde take the kyngdom; and he comaundide hise seruauntis to be clepid, to whiche he hadde yyue monei, to wite, hou myche ech hadde wonne bi chaffaryng.
25742	42	19	16	And the firste cam, and seide, Lord, thi besaunt hath wonne ten besauntis.
25743	42	19	17	He seide to hym, Wel be, thou good seruaunt; for in litil thing thou hast be trewe, thou schalt be hauynge power on ten citees.
25744	42	19	18	And the tother cam, and seide, Lord, thi besaunt hath maad fyue besauntis.
25745	42	19	19	And to this he seide, And be thou on fyue citees.
25746	42	19	20	And the thridde cam, and seide, Lord, lo! thi besaunt, that Y hadde, put vp in a sudarie.
25747	42	19	21	For Y dredde thee, for thou art `a sterne man; thou takist awey that that thou settidist not, and thou repist that that thou hast not sowun.
25748	42	19	22	He seith to hym, Wickid seruaunt, of thi mouth Y deme thee. Wistist thou, that Y am `a sterne man, takynge awei that thing that Y settide not, and repyng ethat thing that Y sewe not?
25749	42	19	23	and whi hast thou not youun my money to the bord, and Y comynge schulde haue axid it with vsuris?
25750	42	19	24	And he seide to men stondynge nyy, Take ye awei fro hym the besaunt, and yyue ye to hym that hath ten beyauntis:
25751	42	19	25	And thei seiden to hym, Lord, he hath ten besauntis.
25752	42	19	26	And Y seie to you, to ech man that hath, it schal be youun, and he schal encreese; but fro him that hath not, also that thing that he hath, schal be takun of hym.
25753	42	19	27	Netheles brynge ye hidur tho myn enemyes, that wolden not that Y regnede on hem, and sle ye bifor me.
25754	42	19	28	And whanne these thingis weren seid, he wente bifore, and yede vp to Jerusalem.
25755	42	19	29	And it was don, whanne Jhesus cam nyy to Bethfage and Betanye, at the mount, that is clepid of Olyuete, he sente hise twei disciplis, and seide,
25756	42	19	30	Go ye in to the castel, that is ayens you; in to which as ye entren, ye schulen fynde a colt of an asse tied, on which neuer man sat; vntye ye hym, and brynge ye to me.
25757	42	19	31	And if ony man axe you, whi ye vntien, thus ye schulen seie to hym, For the Lord desirith his werk.
25758	42	19	32	And thei that weren sent, wenten forth, and fonden as he seide to hem, a colt stondynge.
25759	42	19	33	And whanne thei vntieden the colt, the lordis of hym seiden to hem, What vntien ye the colt?
25760	42	19	34	And thei seiden, For the Lord hath nede to hym.
25761	42	19	35	And thei ledden hym to Jhesu; and thei castynge her clothis on the colt, setten Jhesu on hym.
25762	42	19	36	And whanne he wente, thei strowiden her clothis in the weie.
25763	42	19	37	And whanne he cam nyy to the comyng doun of the mount of Olyuete, al the puple that cam doun bygunnen to ioye, and to herie God with greet vois on alle the vertues, that thei hadden sayn,
25764	42	19	38	and seiden, Blessid be the king, that cometh in the name of the Lord; pees in heuene, and glorie in hiye thingis.
25765	42	19	39	And sum of the Farisees of the puple seiden to hym, Maister, blame thi disciplis.
25766	42	19	40	And he seide to hem, Y seie to you, for if these ben stille, stoonus schulen crye.
25767	42	19	41	And whanne he neiyede, `he seiy the citee,
25768	42	19	42	and wepte on it, and seide, For if thou haddist knowun, thou schuldist wepe also; for in this dai the thingis ben in pees to thee, but now thei ben hid fro thin iyen.
25769	42	19	43	But daies schulen come in thee, and thin enemyes schulen enuyroun thee with a pale, and thei schulen go aboute thee, and make thee streit on alle sidis,
25770	42	19	44	and caste thee doun to the erthe, and thi sones that ben in thee; and thei schulen not leeue in thee a stoon on a stoon, for thou hast not knowun the tyme of thi visitacioun.
25771	42	19	45	And he entride in to the temple, and bigan to caste out men sellynge ther inne and biynge,
25772	42	19	46	and seide to hem, It is writun, That myn hous is an hous of preyer, but ye han maad it a den of theues.
25773	42	19	47	And he was techynge euerydai in the temple. And the princis of prestis, and the scribis, and the princis of the puple souyten to lese hym;
25774	42	19	48	and thei founden not, what thei schulden do to hym, for al the puple was ocupied, and herde hym.
25775	42	20	1	And it was don in oon of the daies, whanne he tauyte the puple in the temple, and prechide the gospel, the princis of preestis and scribis camen togidere with the elder men;
25776	42	20	2	and thei seiden to hym, Seie to vs, in what power thou doist these thingis, or who is he that yaf to thee this power?
25777	42	20	3	And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hem, And Y schal axe you o word; answere ye to me.
25778	42	20	4	Was the baptym of Joon of heuene, or of men?
25779	42	20	5	And thei thouyten with ynne hem silf, seiynge, For if we seien, Of heuene, he schal seie, Whi thanne bileuen ye not to hym?
25780	42	20	6	and if we seien, Of men, al the puple schal stoone vs; for thei ben certeyn, that Joon is a prophete.
25781	42	20	7	And thei answeriden, that thei knewen not, of whennus it was.
25782	42	20	8	And Jhesus seide to hem, Nether Y seie to you, in what power Y do these thingis.
25783	42	20	9	And he bigan to seie to the puple this parable. A man plauntide a vynyerd, and hiride it to tilieris; and he was in pilgrimage longe tyme.
25784	42	20	10	And in the tyme of gaderynge of grapis, he sente a seruaunt to the tilieris, that thei schulden yyue to hym of the fruyt of the vynyerd; whiche beten hym, and leten hym go voide.
25785	42	20	11	And he thouyte yit to sende another seruaunt; and thei beten this, and turmentiden hym sore, and leten hym go.
25786	42	20	12	And he thouyte yit to sende the thridde, and hym also thei woundiden, and castiden out.
25787	42	20	13	And the lord of the vyneyerd seide, What schal Y do? Y schal sende my dereworthe sone; perauenture, whanne thei seen hym, thei schulen drede.
25788	42	20	14	And whanne the tilieris sayn hym, thei thouyten with ynne hem silf, and seiden, This is the eire, sle we hym, that the eritage be oure.
25789	42	20	15	And thei castiden hym out of the vyneyerd, and killiden hym. What schal thanne the lord of the vyneyerd do to hem?
25790	42	20	16	He schal come, and distruye these tilieris, and yyue the vyneyerd to othere. And whanne this thing was herd, thei seiden to hym, God forbede.
25791	42	20	17	But he bihelde hem, and seide, What thanne is this that is writun, The stoon which men bildynge repreueden, this is maad in to the heed of the corner?
25792	42	20	18	Ech that schal falle on that stoon, schal be to-brisid, but on whom it schal falle, it schal al to-breke him.
25793	42	20	19	And the princis of prestis, and scribis, souyten to leye on hym hoondis in that our, and thei dredden the puple; for thei knewen that to hem he seide this liknesse.
25794	42	20	20	And thei aspieden, and senten aspieris, that feyneden hem iust, that thei schulden take hym in word, and bitaak hym to the `power of the prince, and to the power of the iustice.
25795	42	20	21	And thei axiden hym, and seiden, Maister, we witen, that riytli thou seist and techist; and thou takist not the persoone of man, but thou techist in treuthe the weie of God.
25796	42	20	22	Is it leueful to vs to yyue tribute to the emperoure, or nay?
25797	42	20	23	And he biheld the disseit of hem, and seide to hem, What tempten ye me?
25798	42	20	24	Shewe ye to me a peny; whos ymage and superscripcioun hath it? Thei answerden, and seiden to hym, The emperouris.
25799	42	20	25	And he seide to hem, Yelde ye therfor to the emperoure tho thingis that ben the emperours, and tho thingis that ben of God, to God.
25800	42	20	26	And thei myyten not repreue his word bifor the puple; and thei wondriden in his answere, and heelden pees.
25801	42	20	27	Summe of the Saduceis, that denyeden the ayenrisyng fro deeth to lijf, camen, and axiden hym,
25802	42	20	28	and seiden, Maister, Moises wroot to vs, if the brother of ony man haue a wijf, and be deed, and he was with outen eiris, that his brothir take his wijf, and reise seed to his brother.
25803	42	20	29	And so there weren seuene britheren. The firste took a wijf, and is deed with outen eiris;
25804	42	20	30	and the brothir suynge took hir, and he is deed with outen sone;
25805	42	20	31	and the thridde took hir; also and alle seuene, and leften not seed, but ben deed;
25806	42	20	32	and the laste of alle the womman is deed.
25807	42	20	33	Therfor in the `risyng ayen, whos wijf of hem schal sche be? for seuene hadden hir to wijf.
25808	42	20	34	And Jhesus seide to hem, Sones of this world wedden, and ben youun to weddyngis;
25809	42	20	35	but thei that schulen be had worthi of that world, and of the `risyng ayen fro deeth, nethir ben wedded,
25810	42	20	36	nethir wedden wyues, nethir schulen mowe die more; for thei ben euen with aungels, and ben the sones of God, sithen thei ben the sones of `risyng ayen fro deeth.
25811	42	20	37	And that deed men risen ayen, also Moises schewide bisidis the busch, as he seith, The Lord God of Abraham, and God of Ysaac, and God of Jacob.
25812	42	20	38	And God is not of deed men, but of lyuynge men; for alle men lyuen to hym.
25813	42	20	39	And summe of scribis answeringe, seiden, Maistir, thou hast wel seid.
25814	42	20	40	And thei dursten no more axe hym ony thing.
25815	42	20	41	But he seide to hem, How seien men, Crist to be the sone of Dauid,
25816	42	20	42	and Dauid hym silf seith in the book of Salmes, The Lord seide to my lord, Sitte thou on my riythalf,
25817	42	20	43	til that Y putte thin enemyes a stool of thi feet?
25818	42	20	44	Therfor Dauid clepith hym lord, and hou is he his sone?
25819	42	20	45	And in heryng of al the puple, he seide to hise disciplis,
25820	42	20	46	Be ye war of scribis, that wolen wandre in stolis, and louen salutaciouns in chepyng, and the firste chaieris in synagogis, and the firste sittynge placis in feestis;
25821	42	20	47	that deuouren the housis of widewis, and feynen long preiyng; these schulen take the more dampnacioun.
25822	42	21	1	And he biheeld, and saye tho riche men, that casten her yiftis in to the treserie;
25823	42	21	2	but he saye also a litil pore widewe castynge twei ferthingis.
25824	42	21	3	And he seide, Treuli Y seie to you, that this pore widewe keste more than alle men.
25825	42	21	4	For whi alle these of thing that was plenteuouse to hem casten in to the yiftis of God; but this widewe of that thing that failide to hir, caste al hir liflode, that sche hadde.
25826	42	21	5	And whanne sum men seiden of the temple, that it was apparailid with gode stoonus and yiftis,
25827	42	21	6	he seide, These thingis that ye seen, daies schulen come, in whiche a stoon schal not be left on a stoon, which schal not be destried.
25828	42	21	7	And thei axiden hym, and seiden, Comaundour, whanne schulen these thingis be? and what tokne schal be, whanne thei schulen bigynne to be don?
25829	42	21	8	And he seide, Se ye, that ye be not disseyued; for many schulen come in my name, seiynge, For Y am, and the tyme schal neiye; therfor nyle ye go aftir hem.
25830	42	21	9	And whanne ye schulen here batailis and stryues with ynne, nyle ye be aferd; it bihoueth first these thingis to be don, but not yit anoon is an ende.
25831	42	21	10	Thanne he seide to hem, Folk schal rise ayens folk, and rewme ayens rewme;
25832	42	21	11	grete mouyngis of erthe schulen be bi placis, and pestilencis, and hungris, and dredis fro heuene, and grete tokenes schulen be.
25833	42	21	12	But bifore alle these thingis thei schulen sette her hoondis on you, and schulen pursue, bitakynge in to synagogis and kepyngis, drawynge to kyngis and to iusticis, for my name;
25834	42	21	13	but it schal falle to you in to witnessyng.
25835	42	21	14	Therfor putte ye in youre hertis, not to thenke bifore, hou ye schulen answere; for Y schal yyue to you mouth and wisdom,
25836	42	21	15	to whiche alle youre aduersaries schulen not mowe ayenstonde, and ayenseie.
25837	42	21	16	And ye schulen be takun of fadir, and modir, and britheren, and cosyns, and freendis, and bi deeth thei schulen turmente of you;
25838	42	21	17	and ye schulen be in haate to alle men for my name.
25839	42	21	18	And an heere of youre heed schal not perische;
25840	42	21	19	in youre pacience ye schulen welde youre soulis.
25841	42	21	20	But whanne ye schulen se Jerusalem ben enuyround with an oost, thanne wite ye, that the desolacioun of it schal neiye.
25842	42	21	21	Thanne thei that ben in Judee, fle to the mountans; and thei that ben in the mydil of it, gon awei; and thei that ben in the cuntreis, entre not in to it.
25843	42	21	22	For these ben daies of veniaunce, that alle thingis that ben writun, be fulfillid.
25844	42	21	23	And wo to hem, that ben with child, and norischen in tho daies; for a greet diseese schal be on the erthe, and wraththe to this puple.
25845	42	21	24	And thei schulen falle bi the scharpnesse of swerd, and thei schulen be led prisoneris in to alle folkis; and Jerusalem schal be defoulid of hethene men, til the tymes of naciouns be fulfillid.
25846	42	21	25	And tokenes schulen be in the sunne, and the mone, and in the sterris; and in the erthe ouerleiyng of folkis, for confusioun of sown of the see and of floodis;
25847	42	21	26	for men schulen wexe drye for drede and abidyng that schulen come to al the world; for vertues of heuenes schulen be mouyd.
25848	42	21	27	And thanne thei schulen se mannys sone comynge in a cloude, with greet power and maieste.
25849	42	21	28	And whanne these thingis bigynnen to be maad, biholde ye, and reise ye youre heedis, for youre redempcioun neiyeth.
25850	42	21	29	And he seide to hem a liknesse, Se ye the fige tre, and alle trees,
25851	42	21	30	whanne thei bryngen forth now of hem silf fruyt, ye witen that somer is nyy;
25852	42	21	31	so ye, whanne ye seen these thingis to be don, wite ye, that the kyngdom of God is nyy.
25853	42	21	32	Treuli Y seie to you, that this generacioun schal not passe, til alle thingis be don.
25854	42	21	33	Heuene and erthe schulen passe, but my wordis schulen not passe.
25855	42	21	34	But take ye heede to you silf, lest perauenture youre hertis be greuyd with glotony, and drunkenesse, and bisynessis of this lijf, and thilke dai come sodein on you; for as a snare it schal come on alle men,
25856	42	21	35	that sitten on the face of al erthe.
25857	42	21	36	Therfor wake ye, preiynge in ech tyme, that ye be hadde worthi to fle alle these thingis that ben to come, and to stonde bifor mannus sone.
25858	42	21	37	And in daies he was techynge in the temple, but in nyytis he yede out, and dwellide in the mount, that is clepid of Olyuet.
25859	42	21	38	And al the puple roos eerli, to come to hym in the temple, and to here hym.
25860	42	22	1	And the halidai of therf looues, that is seid pask, neiyede.
25861	42	22	2	And the princis of preestis and the scribis souyten, hou thei schulden sle Jhesu, but thei dredden the puple.
25862	42	22	3	And Sathanas entride in to Judas, that was clepid Scarioth, oon of the twelue.
25863	42	22	4	And he wente, and spak with the princis of preestis, and with the magistratis, hou he schulde bitray hym to hem.
25864	42	22	5	And thei ioyeden, and maden couenaunt to yyue hym money.
25865	42	22	6	And he bihiyte, and he souyte oportunyte, to bitraye hym, with outen puple.
25866	42	22	7	But the daies of therf looues camen, in whiche it was neede, that the sacrifice of pask were slayn.
25867	42	22	8	And he sente Petre and Joon, and seide, Go ye, and make ye redi to vs the pask, that we ete.
25868	42	22	9	And thei seiden, Where wolt thou, that we make redi?
25869	42	22	10	And he seide to hem, Lo! whanne ye schulen entre in to the citee, a man berynge a vessel of watir schal meete you; sue ye hym in to the hous, in to which he entrith.
25870	42	22	11	And ye schulen seie to the hosebonde man of the hous, The maister seith to thee, Where is a chaumbre, where Y schal ete the pask with my disciplis?
25871	42	22	12	And he schal schewe to you a greet soupyng place strewid, and there make ye redi.
25872	42	22	13	And thei yeden, and founden as he seide to hem, and thei maden redi the pask.
25873	42	22	14	And whanne the our was come, he sat to the mete, and the twelue apostlis with hym.
25874	42	22	15	And he seide to hem, With desier Y haue desirid to ete with you this pask, bifor that Y suffre;
25875	42	22	16	for Y seie to you, that fro this tyme Y schal not ete it, til it be fulfillid in the rewme of God.
25876	42	22	17	And whanne he hadde take the cuppe, he dide gracis, and seide, Take ye, and departe ye among you;
25877	42	22	18	for Y seie to you, that Y schal not drynke of the kynde of this vyne, til the rewme of God come.
25878	42	22	19	And whanne he hadde take breed, he dide thankyngis, and brak, and yaf to hem, and seide, This is my bodi, that schal be youun for you; do ye this thing in mynde of me.
25879	42	22	20	He took also the cuppe, aftir that he hadde soupid, and seide, This cuppe is the newe testament in my blood, that schal be sched for you.
25880	42	22	21	Netheles lo! the hoond of hym that bitraieth me, is with me at the table.
25881	42	22	22	And mannus sone goith, `aftir that it is determyned; netheles wo to that man, bi whom he schal be bitraied.
25882	42	22	23	And thei bigunnen to seke among hem, who it was of hem, that was to do this thing.
25883	42	22	24	And strijf was maad among hem, which of hem schulde be seyn to be grettest.
25884	42	22	25	But he seide to hem, Kyngis of hethen men ben lordis of hem, and thei that han power on hem ben clepid good doeris, but ye not so;
25885	42	22	26	but he that is grettest among you, be maad as yongere, and he that is bifor goere, as a seruaunt.
25886	42	22	27	For who is gretter, he that sittith at the mete, or he that mynystrith? whether not he that sittith at the mete? And Y am in the myddil of you, as he that mynystrith.
25887	42	22	28	And ye ben, that han dwellid with me in my temptaciouns; and Y dispose to you,
25888	42	22	29	as my fadir hath disposid to me,
25889	42	22	30	a rewme, that ye ete and drynke on my boord in my rewme, and sitte on trones, and deme the twelue kynredis of Israel.
25890	42	22	31	And the Lord seide to Symount, Symount, lo, Satanas hath axid you, that he schulde ridile as whete; but Y haue preyede for thee,
25891	42	22	32	that thi feith faile not; and thou sum tyme conuertid, conferme thi britheren.
25892	42	22	33	Which seide to hym, Lord, Y am redi to go in to prisoun and in to deeth with thee.
25893	42	22	34	And he seide, Y seie to thee, Petir, the cok schal not crowe to dai, til thou thries forsake that thou knowist me.
25894	42	22	35	And he seide to hem, Whanne Y sente you with outen sachel, and scrippe, and schone, whether ony thing failide to you?
25895	42	22	36	And thei seiden, No thing. Therfor he seide to hem, But now he that hath a sachel, take also and a scrippe; and he that hath noon, selle his coote, and bigge a swerd.
25896	42	22	37	For Y seie to you, that yit it bihoueth that thing that is writun to be fulfillid in me, And he is arettid with wickid men; for tho thingis that ben of me han ende.
25897	42	22	38	And thei seiden, Lord, lo! twei swerdis here. And he seide to hem, It is ynowy.
25898	42	22	39	And he yede out, and wente aftir the custom in to the hille of Olyues; and the disciplis sueden hym.
25899	42	22	40	And whanne he cam to the place, he seide to hem, Preye ye, lest ye entren in to temptacioun.
25900	42	22	41	And he was taken awei fro hem, so myche as is a stonys cast; and he knelide,
25901	42	22	42	and preyede, and seide, Fadir, if thou wolt, do awei this cuppe fro me; netheles not my wille be don, but thin.
25902	42	22	43	And an aungel apperide to hym fro heuene, and coumfortide hym. And he was maad in agonye, and preyede the lenger;
25903	42	22	44	and his swot was maad as dropis of blood rennynge doun in to the erthe.
25904	42	22	45	And whanne he was rysun fro preier, and was comun to hise disciplis, he foond hem slepynge for heuynesse.
25905	42	22	46	And he seide to hem, What slepen ye? Rise ye, and preye ye, that ye entre not in to temptacioun.
25906	42	22	47	Yit while he spak, lo! a company, and he that was clepid Judas, oon of the twelue, wente bifor hem; and he cam to Jhesu, to kisse hym.
25907	42	22	48	And Jhesus seide to hym, Judas, `with a coss `thou bytrayest `mannys sone.
25908	42	22	49	And thei that weren aboute hym, and sayn that that was to come, seiden to hym, Lord, whether we smyten with swerd?
25909	42	22	50	And oon of hem smoot the seruaunt of the prince of preestis, and kittide of his riyt eere.
25910	42	22	51	But Jhesus answerde, and seide, Suffre ye til hidir. And whanne he hadde touchid his eere, he heelide hym.
25911	42	22	52	And Jhesus seide to hem, that camen to hym, the princis of preestis, and maiestratis of the temple, and eldre men, As to a theef ye han gon out with swerdis and staues?
25912	42	22	53	Whanne Y was ech dai with you in the temple, ye streiyten not out hondis in to me; but this is youre our, and the power of derknessis.
25913	42	22	54	And thei token him, and ledden to the hous of the prince of prestis; and Petir suede hym afer.
25914	42	22	55	And whanne a fier was kyndelid in the myddil of the greet hous, and thei saten aboute, Petir was in the myddil of hem.
25915	42	22	56	Whom whanne a damysel hadde seyn sittynge `at the liyt, and hadde biholdun hym, sche seide, And this was with hym.
25916	42	22	57	And he denyede hym, and seide, Womman, Y knowe hym not.
25917	42	22	58	And aftir a litil another man siy hym, and seide, And thou art of hem. But Petir seide, A! man, Y am not.
25918	42	22	59	And whanne a space was maad as of on our, another affermyd, and seide, Treuli this was with hym; for also he is of Galilee.
25919	42	22	60	And Petir seide, Man, Y noot what thou seist. And anoon yit while he spak, the cok crewe.
25920	42	22	61	And the Lord turnede ayen, and bihelde Petre; and Petre hadde mynde on the word of Jhesu, as he hadde seid, For bifor that the cok crowe, thries thou schalt denye me.
25921	42	22	62	And Petre yede out, and wepte bittirli.
25922	42	22	63	And the men that helden hym scorneden hym, and smyten hym.
25923	42	22	64	And thei blynfelden hym, and smyten his face, and axiden hym, and seiden, Arede, thou Crist, to vs, who is he that smoot thee?
25924	42	22	65	Also thei blasfemynge seiden ayens hym many other thingis.
25925	42	22	66	And as the day was come, the eldre men of the puple, and the princis of prestis, and the scribis camen togidir, and ledden hym in to her councel,
25926	42	22	67	and seiden, If thou art Crist, seie to vs.
25927	42	22	68	And he seide to hem, If Y seie to you, ye schulen not bileue to me; and if Y axe, ye schulen not answere to me, nethir ye schulen delyuere me.
25928	42	22	69	But aftir this tyme mannys sone schal be sittynge on the riyt half of the vertu of God.

25940	42	23	10	And the princis of preestis and the scribis stoden, stidfastli accusynge hym.
25941	42	23	11	But Eroude with his oost dispiside hym, and scornede hym, and clothide with a white cloth, and sente hym ayen to Pilat.
25942	42	23	12	And Eroude and Pilat weren maad freendis fro that dai; for bifor thei weren enemyes togidre.
25943	42	23	13	And Pilat clepide togider the princis of prestis and the maiestratis of the puple, and seide to hem,

25957	42	23	27	And there suede hym myche puple, and wymmen that weiliden, and bymorneden hym.
25958	42	23	28	And Jhesus turnede to hem, and seide, Douytris of Jerusalem, nyle ye wepe on me, but wepe ye on youre silf and on youre sones.
25959	42	23	29	For lo! daies schulen come, in whiche it schal be seid, Blessid be bareyn wymmen, and wombis that han not borun children, and the tetis that han not youun souke.

25961	42	23	31	For if in a greene tre thei don these thingis, what schal be don in a drie?
25962	42	23	32	Also othere twei wickid men weren led with hym, to be slayn.
25963	42	23	33	And `aftir that thei camen in to a place, that is clepid of Caluerie, there thei crucifieden hym, and the theues, oon on the riyt half, and `the tother on the left half.
25964	42	23	34	But Jhesus seide, Fadir, foryyue hem, for thei witen not what thei doon.
25965	42	23	35	And thei departiden his clothis, and kesten lottis. And the puple stood abidynge; and the princis scorneden hym with hem, and seiden, Othere men he maad saaf; make he hym silf saaf, if this be Crist, the chosun of God.
25966	42	23	36	And the knyytis neiyeden, and scorneden hym, and profreden vynegre to hym,
25967	42	23	37	and seiden, If thou art king of Jewis, make thee saaf.
25968	42	23	38	And the superscripcioun was writun ouer hym with Greke lettris, and of Latyn, and of Ebreu, This is the kyng of Jewis.
25969	42	23	39	And oon of these theues that hangiden, blasfemyde hym, and seide, If thou art Crist, make thi silf saaf and vs.
25970	42	23	40	But `the tothir answerynge, blamyde hym, and seide, Nether thou dredist God, that art in the same dampnacioun?
25971	42	23	41	And treuli we iustli, for we han resseiued worthi thingis to werkis; but this dide no thing of yuel.
25972	42	23	42	And he seide to Jhesu, Lord, haue mynde of me, whanne thou comest `in to thi kyngdom.
25973	42	23	43	And Jhesus seide to hym, Treuli Y seie to thee, this dai thou schalt be with me in paradise.

25982	42	23	52	This Joseph cam to Pilat, and axide the bodi of Jhesu,

25992	42	24	6	He is not here, but is risun. Haue ye mynde, hou he spak to you, whanne he was yit in Galile,
25993	42	24	7	and seide, For it bihoueth mannys sone to be bitakun in to the hondis of synful men, and to be crucified, and the thridde dai to rise ayen.
25994	42	24	8	And thei bithouyten on hise wordis.

26012	42	24	26	Whethir it bihofte not Crist to suffre these thingis, and so to entre in to his glorie?
26013	42	24	27	And he bigan at Moises and at alle the prophetis, and declaride to hem in alle scripturis, that weren of hym.
26014	42	24	28	And thei camen nyy the castel, whidur thei wenten. And he made countenaunce that he wolde go ferthere.

26022	42	24	36	And the while thei spaken these thingis, Jhesus stood in the myddil of hem, and seide to hem, Pees to you; Y am, nyle ye drede.
26023	42	24	37	But thei weren affraied and agast, and gessiden hem to se a spirit.
26024	42	24	38	And he seide to hem, What ben ye troblid, and thouytis comen vp in to youre hertis?
26025	42	24	39	Se ye my hoondis and my feet, for Y my silf am. Fele ye, and se ye; for a spirit hath not fleisch and boonys, as ye seen that Y haue.
26026	42	24	40	And whanne he hadde seid this thing, he schewide hoondis and feet to hem.

26035	42	24	49	And Y schal sende the biheest of my fadir in to you; but sitte ye in the citee, til that ye be clothid with vertu from an hiy.
26036	42	24	50	And he ledde hem forth in to Betanye, and whanne his hondis weren lift vp, he blesside hem.
26037	42	24	51	And it was don, the while he blesside hem, he departide fro hem, and was borun in to heuene.

26039	42	24	53	and weren euermore in the temple, heriynge and blessynge God.
26040	43	1	1	In the bigynnyng was the word, and the word was at God, and God was the word.
26041	43	1	2	This was in the bigynnyng at God.
26042	43	1	3	Alle thingis weren maad bi hym, and withouten hym was maad no thing, that thing that was maad.
26043	43	1	4	In hym was lijf, and the lijf was the liyt of men; and the liyt schyneth in derknessis,
26044	43	1	5	and derknessis comprehendiden not it.
26045	43	1	6	A man was sent fro God, to whom the name was Joon.
26046	43	1	7	This man cam in to witnessyng, that he schulde bere witnessing of the liyt, that alle men schulden bileue bi hym.
26047	43	1	8	He was not the liyt, but that he schulde bere witnessing of the liyt.
26048	43	1	9	There was a very liyt, which liytneth ech man that cometh in to this world.
26049	43	1	10	He was in the world, and the world was maad bi hym, and the world knew hym not.
26050	43	1	11	He cam in to his owne thingis, and hise resseyueden hym not.

26053	43	1	14	And the word was maad man, and dwellyde among vs, and we han seyn the glorie of hym, as the glorie of the `oon bigetun sone of the fadir, ful of grace and of treuthe.
26054	43	1	15	Joon berith witnessyng of hym, and crieth, and seith, This is, whom Y seide, He that schal come aftir me, is maad bifore me, for he was tofor me;
26055	43	1	16	and of the plente of hym we alle han takun, and grace for grace.
26056	43	1	17	For the lawe was youun bi Moises; but grace and treuthe `is maad bi Jhesu Crist.
26057	43	1	18	No man sai euer God, no but the `oon bigetun sone, that is in the bosum of the fadir, he hath teld out.
26058	43	1	19	And this is the witnessyng of Joon, whanne Jewis senten fro Jerusalem prestis and dekenes to hym, that thei schulden axe hym, Who art thou?
26059	43	1	20	He knoulechide, and denyede not, and he knoulechide, For Y am not Crist.
26060	43	1	21	And thei axiden hym, What thanne? Art thou Elie? And he seide, Y am not. Art thou a profete? And he answeride, Nay.
26061	43	1	22	Therfor thei seiden to hym, Who art thou? that we yyue an answere to these that senten vs. What seist thou of thi silf?
26062	43	1	23	He seide, Y am a vois of a crier in deseert, Dresse ye the weie of the Lord, as Ysaie, the prophete, seide.
26063	43	1	24	And thei that weren sent, weren of the Fariseis.
26064	43	1	25	And thei axiden hym, and seiden to hym, What thanne baptisist thou, if thou art not Crist, nether Elie, nether a profete?
26065	43	1	26	Joon answeride to hem, and seide, Y baptise in watir, but in the myddil of you hath stonde oon, that ye knowen not;
26066	43	1	27	he it is, that schal come aftir me, that was maad bifor me, of whom Y am not worthi to louse the thwong of his schoo.

26069	43	1	30	This is he, that Y seide of, Aftir me is comun a man, which was maad bifor me; for he was rather than Y.
26070	43	1	31	And Y knew hym not, but that he be schewid in Israel, therfor Y cam baptisynge in watir.
26071	43	1	32	And Joon bar witnessyng, and seide, That Y saiy the spirit comynge doun as a culuer fro heuene, and dwellide on hym.
26072	43	1	33	And Y knew hym not; but he that sente me to baptise in watir, seide to me, On whom thou seest the Spirit comynge doun, and dwellynge on hym, this is he, that baptisith in the Hooli Goost.
26073	43	1	34	And Y say, and bar witnessyng, that this is the sone of God.

26078	43	1	39	And he seith to hem, Come ye, and se. And thei camen, and sayn where he dwellide; and dwelten with hym that dai. And it was as the tenthe our.
26079	43	1	40	And Andrewe, the brother of Symount Petir, was oon of the tweyne, that herden of Joon, and hadden sued hym.
26080	43	1	41	This foond first his brother Symount, and he seide to him, We han foundun Messias, that is to seie, Crist; and he ledde him to Jhesu.
26081	43	1	42	And Jhesus bihelde hym, and seide, Thou art Symount, the sone of Johanna; thou schalt be clepid Cefas, that is to seie, Petre.
26082	43	1	43	And on the morewe he wolde go out in to Galilee, and he foond Filip; and he seith to hym, Sue thou me.
26083	43	1	44	Filip was of Bethsaida, the citee of Andrew and of Petre.
26084	43	1	45	Filip foond Nathanael, and seide to hym, We han foundun Jhesu, the sone of Joseph, of Nazareth, whom Moyses wroot in the lawe and profetis.
26085	43	1	46	And Nathanael seide to hym, Of Nazareth may sum good thing be?
26086	43	1	47	Filip seide to hym, Come, and se. Jhesus siy Nathanael comynge to hym, and seide to hym, Lo! verili a man of Israel, in whom is no gile.

26088	43	1	49	`and seide, Rabi, thou art the sone of God, thou art kyng of Israel.
26089	43	1	50	Jhesus answerde, and seide to hym, For Y seide to thee, Y sawy thee vndur the fige tre, thou bileuest; thou schalt se more than these thingis.
26090	43	1	51	And he seide to hem, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, ye schulen se heuene opened, and the aungels of God stiynge vp and comynge doun on mannys sone.

26092	43	2	2	And Jhesus was clepid, and hise disciplis, to the weddyngis.
26093	43	2	3	And whanne wijn failide, the modir of Jhesu seide to hym, Thei han not wijn.
26094	43	2	4	And Jhesus seith to hir, What to me and to thee, womman? myn our cam not yit.
26095	43	2	5	His modir seith to the mynystris, What euere thing he seie to you, do ye.
26096	43	2	6	And there weren set `sixe stonun cannes, aftir the clensyng of the Jewis, holdynge ech tweyne ether thre metretis.
26097	43	2	7	And Jhesus seith to hem, Fille ye the pottis with watir. And thei filliden hem, vp to the mouth.
26098	43	2	8	And Jhesus seide to hem, Drawe ye now, and bere ye to the architriclyn. And thei baren.
26099	43	2	9	And whanne the architriclyn hadde tastid the watir maad wiyn, and wiste not wherof it was, but the mynystris wisten that drowen the watir, the architriclyn clepith the spouse,
26100	43	2	10	and seith to hym, Ech man settith first good wiyn, and whanne men ben fulfillid, thanne that that is worse; but thou hast kept the good wiyn `in to this tyme.
26101	43	2	11	Jhesus dide this the bigynnyng of signes in the Cane of Galilee, and schewide his glorie; and hise disciplis bileueden in hym.
26102	43	2	12	Aftir these thingis he cam doun to Cafarnaum, and his modir, and hise britheren, and hise disciplis; and thei dwelliden `there not many daies.
26103	43	2	13	And the pask of Jewis was nyy, and Jhesus wente vp to Jerusalem.
26104	43	2	14	And he foond in the temple men sillynge oxun, and scheep, and culueris, and chaungeris sittynge.
26105	43	2	15	And whanne he hadde maad as it were a scourge of smale cordis, he droof out alle of the temple, and oxun, and scheep; and he schedde the money of chaungeris, and turnede vpsedoun the boordis.
26106	43	2	16	And he seide to hem that selden culueris, Take awei fro hennus these thingis, and nyle ye make the hous of my fadir an hous of marchaundise.
26107	43	2	17	And hise disciplis hadden mynde, for it was writun, The feruent loue of thin hous hath etun me.
26108	43	2	18	Therfor the Jewis answeriden, and seiden to hym, What token schewist thou to vs, that thou doist these thingis?
26109	43	2	19	Jhesus answerde, and seide to hem, Vndo ye this temple, and in thre daies Y schal reise it.
26110	43	2	20	Therfor the Jewis seiden to hym, In fourti and sixe yeer this temple was bildid, and schalt thou in thre daies reise it?
26111	43	2	21	But he seide of the temple of his bodi.
26112	43	2	22	Therfor whanne he was risun fro deeth, hise disciplis hadden mynde, that he seide these thingis of his bodi; and thei bileueden to the scripture, and to the word that Jhesus seide.
26113	43	2	23	And whanne Jhesus was at Jerusalem in pask, in the feeste dai, many bileueden in his name, seynge his signes that he dide.
26114	43	2	24	But Jhesus trowide not hym silf to hem, for he knewe alle men;
26115	43	2	25	and for it was not nede to hym, that ony man schulde bere witnessyng, for he wiste, what was in man.
26116	43	3	1	And there was a man of the Farisees, Nychodeme bi name, a prince of the Jewis.
26117	43	3	2	And he cam to Jhesu bi niyt, and seide to hym, Rabi, we witen, that thou art comun fro God maister; for no man may do these signes, that thou doist, but God be with hym.
26118	43	3	3	Jhesus answerde, and seide to hym, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to thee, but a man be borun ayen, he may not se the kyngdom of God.
26119	43	3	4	Nychodeme seide to hym, Hou may a man be borun, whanne he is eeld? whether he may entre ayen in to his modris wombe, and be borun ayen?
26120	43	3	5	Jhesus answeride, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to thee, but a man be borun ayen of watir, and of the Hooli Goost, he may not entre in to the kyngdom of God.
26121	43	3	6	`That that is borun of the fleisch, is fleisch; and `that that is borun of spirit, is spirit.
26122	43	3	7	Wondre thou not, for Y seide to thee, It bihoueth you to be borun ayen.
26123	43	3	8	The spirit brethith where he wole, and thou herist his vois, but thou wost not, fro whennus he cometh, ne whidir he goith; so is ech man that is borun of the spirit.
26124	43	3	9	Nychodeme answeride, and seide to hym, Hou moun these thingis be don?
26125	43	3	10	Jhesus answeride, and seide to hym, Thou art a maister in Israel, and knowist not these thingis?
26126	43	3	11	Treuli, treuli, Y seie to thee, for we speken that that we witen, and we witnessen that that we han seyn, and ye taken not oure witnessyng.
26127	43	3	12	If Y haue seid to you ertheli thingis, and ye bileuen not, hou if Y seie to you heueneli thingis, schulen ye bileue?
26128	43	3	13	And no man stieth in to heuene, but he that cam doun fro heuene, mannys sone that is in heuene.
26129	43	3	14	And as Moises areride a serpent in desert, so it bihoueth mannys sone to be reisid,
26130	43	3	15	that ech man that bileueth in hym, perische not, but haue euerlastynge lijf.
26131	43	3	16	For God louede so the world, that he yaf his `oon bigetun sone, that ech man that bileueth in him perische not, but haue euerlastynge lijf.
26132	43	3	17	For God sente not his sone in to the world, that he iuge the world, but that the world be saued bi him.
26133	43	3	18	He that bileueth in hym, is not demed; but he that bileueth not, is now demed, for he bileueth not in the name of the `oon bigetun sone of God.
26134	43	3	19	And this is the dom, for liyt cam in to the world, and men loueden more derknessis than liyt; for her werkes weren yuele.
26135	43	3	20	For ech man that doith yuele, hatith the liyt; and he cometh not to the liyt, that hise werkis be not repreued.
26136	43	3	21	But he that doith treuthe, cometh to the liyt, that hise werkis be schewid, that thei ben don in God.
26137	43	3	22	Aftir these thingis Jhesus cam, and hise disciplis, in to the loond of Judee, and there he dwellide with hem, and baptiside.
26138	43	3	23	And Joon was baptisinge in Ennon, bisidis Salym, for many watris weren there; and thei camen, and weren baptisid.
26139	43	3	24	And Joon was not yit sent in to prisoun.
26140	43	3	25	Therfor a questioun was maad of Jonys disciplis with the Jewis, of the purificacioun.
26141	43	3	26	And thei camen to Joon, and seiden `to hym, Maister, he that was with thee biyonde Jordan, to whom thou hast borun witnessyng, lo! he baptisith, and alle men comen to hym.
26142	43	3	27	Joon answerde, and seide, A man may not take ony thing, but it be youun to hym fro heuene.
26143	43	3	28	Ye you silf beren witnessyng to me, that Y seide, Y am not Crist, but that Y am sent bifore hym.
26144	43	3	29	He that hath a wijf, is the hosebonde; but the freend of the spouse that stondith, and herith hym, ioieth with ioye, for the vois of the spouse. Therfor in this thing my ioye is fulfillid.
26145	43	3	30	It bihoueth hym to wexe, but me to be maad lesse.
26146	43	3	31	He that cam from aboue, is aboue alle; he that is of the erthe, spekith of the erthe; he that cometh from heuene, is aboue alle.
26147	43	3	32	And he witnessith that thing that he hath seie, and herde, and no man takith his witnessing.
26148	43	3	33	But he that takith his witnessyng, hath confermyd that God is sothefast.
26149	43	3	34	But he whom God hath sent, spekith the wordis of God; for not to mesure God yyueth the spirit.
26150	43	3	35	The fadir loueth the sone, and he hath youun alle thingis in his hoond.
26151	43	3	36	He that bileueth in the sone, hath euerlastynge lijf; but he that is vnbileueful to the sone, schal not se euerlastynge lijf, but the wraththe of God dwellith on hym.
26152	43	4	1	Therfor as Jhesu knew, that the Farisees herden, that Jhesu makith and baptisith mo disciplis than Joon,
26153	43	4	2	thouy Jhesus baptiside not, but hise disciplis, he lefte Judee,
26154	43	4	3	and wente ayen in to Galilee.
26155	43	4	4	And it bihofte hym to passe bi Samarie.
26156	43	4	5	Therfor Jhesus cam in to a citee of Samarie, that is seid Sicar, bisidis the place, that Jacob yaf to Joseph, his sone.
26157	43	4	6	And the welle of Jacob was there; and Jhesus was weri of the iourney, and sat thus vpon the welle. And the our was, as it were the sixte.
26158	43	4	7	And a womman cam fro Samarie, to drawe watir. And Jhesus seith to hir, Yyue me drynk.
26159	43	4	8	And hise disciplis weren gon in to the citee, to bie mete.
26160	43	4	9	Therfor thilke womman of Samarie seith to him, Hou thou, `whanne thou art a Jewe, axist of me drynk, that am a womman of Samarie? for Jewis vsiden not to dele with Samaritans.
26161	43	4	10	Jhesus answerde, and seide to hir, If thou wistist the yifte of God, and who `he is, that seith to thee, Yyue me drynk, thou perauenture woldist haue axid of hym, and he schulde haue youun to thee quyk watir.
26162	43	4	11	The womman seith to him, Sire, thou hast not where ynne to drawe, and the pit is deep; wherof thanne hast thou quik watir?
26163	43	4	12	Whethir thou art grettere than oure fadir Jacob, that yaf to vs the pit? and he drank therof, and hise sones, and hise beestis.
26164	43	4	13	Jhesus answerde, and seide to hir, Eche man that drynkith of this watir, schal thirste efte soone; but he that drynkith of the watir that Y schal yyue hym, schal not thirste with outen ende; but the watir that Y schal yyue hym,
26165	43	4	14	schal be maad in hym a welle `of watir, spryngynge vp in to euerlastynge lijf.
26166	43	4	15	The womman seith to hym, Sire, yyue me this watir, that Y thirste not, nether come hidur to drawe.
26167	43	4	16	Jhesus seith to hir, Go, clepe thin hosebonde, and come hidir.
26168	43	4	17	The womman answerde, and seide, Y haue noon hosebonde. Jhesus seith to hir, Thou seidist wel, That Y haue noon hosebonde;
26169	43	4	18	for thou hast hadde fyue hosebondis, and he that thou hast, is not thin hosebonde. This thing thou seidist sotheli.
26170	43	4	19	The womman seith to hym, Lord, Y se, that thou art a prophete.
26171	43	4	20	Oure fadris worschipiden in this hil, and ye seien, that at Jerusalem is a place, where it bihoueth to worschipe.
26172	43	4	21	Jhesus seith to hir, Womman, bileue thou to me, for the our schal come, whanne nether in this hil, nethir in Jerusalem, ye schulen worschipe the fadir.
26173	43	4	22	Ye worschipen that ye knowen not; we worschipen that that we knowen; for helthe is of the Jewis.
26174	43	4	23	But the tyme is comun, and now it is, whanne trewe worschiperis schulen worschipe the fadir in spirit and treuthe; for also the fadir sekith suche, that worschipen hym.
26175	43	4	24	God is a spirit, and it bihoueth hem that worschipen hym, to worschipe in spirit and treuthe.
26176	43	4	25	The womman seith to hym, Y woot that Messias is comun, that is seid Crist; therfor whanne he cometh, he schal telle vs alle thingis.
26177	43	4	26	Jhesus seith to hir, Y am he, that spekith with thee.
26178	43	4	27	And anoon hise disciplis camen, and wondriden, that he spak with the womman; netheles no man seide to hym, What sekist thou, or, What spekist thou with hir?
26179	43	4	28	Therfor the womman lefte hir watir pot, and wente in to the citee, and seide to tho men,
26180	43	4	29	Come ye, and se ye a man, that seide to me alle thingis that Y haue don; whether he be Crist?
26181	43	4	30	And thei wenten out of the citee, and camen to hym.
26182	43	4	31	In the mene while hise disciplis preieden hym, and seiden, Maistir, ete.
26183	43	4	32	But he seide to hem, Y haue mete to ete, that ye knowen not.
26184	43	4	33	Therfor disciplis seiden togidir, Whether ony man hath brouyt him mete to ete?
26185	43	4	34	Jhesus seith to hem, My mete is, that Y do the wille of hym that sente me, that Y perfourme the werk of hym.
26186	43	4	35	Whether ye seien not, that yit foure monethis ben, and rype corn cometh? Lo! Y seie to you, lifte vp youre iyen, and se ye the feeldis, for now thei ben white to repe.
26187	43	4	36	And he that repith takith hire, and gaderith fruyt in to euerlastynge lijf; that bothe he that sowith, and he that repith, haue ioye togidere.
26188	43	4	37	In this thing is the word trewe, for anothir is that sowith, and anothir that repith.
26189	43	4	38	Y sente you to repe, that that ye `haue not trauelid; `othere men han trauelid, and ye han entrid `in to her trauels.
26190	43	4	39	And of that citee many Samaritans bileueden in hym, for the word of the womman, that bare witnessyng, That he seide to me alle thingis that Y haue don.
26191	43	4	40	Therfor whanne Samaritans camen to hym, thei preieden hym to dwelle there; and he dwelte there twey daies.
26192	43	4	41	And many mo bileueden for his word,
26193	43	4	42	and seiden to the womman, That now not for thi speche we bileuen; for we han herd, and we witen, that this is verili the sauyour of the world.
26194	43	4	43	And aftir twei daies he wente out fro thennus, and wente in to Galilee.
26195	43	4	44	And he bar witnessyng, that a profete in his owne cuntre hath noon onour.
26196	43	4	45	Therfor whanne he cam in to Galilee, men of Galilee resseyueden hym, whanne thei hadden seyn alle thingis that he hadde don in Jerusalem in the feeste dai; for also thei hadden comun to the feeste dai.
26197	43	4	46	Therfor he cam eftsoone in to the Cane of Galile, where he made the watir wiyn. And `a litil kyng was, whos sone was sijk at Cafarnaum.
26198	43	4	47	Whanne this hadde herd, that Jhesu schulde come fro Judee in to Galilee, he wente to hym, and preiede hym, that he schulde come doun, and heele his sone; for he bigan to die.
26199	43	4	48	Therfor Jhesus seide to him, But ye se tokenes and grete wondris, ye bileuen not.
26200	43	4	49	The litil kyng seith to hym, Lord, come doun, bifor that my sone die.
26201	43	4	50	Jhesus seith to hym, Go, thi sone lyueth. The man bileuede to the word, that Jhesus seide to hym, and he wente.
26202	43	4	51	And now whanne he cam doun, the seruauntis camen ayens hym, and telden to hym, and seiden, That his sone lyuede.
26203	43	4	52	And he axide of hem the our, in which he was amendid. And thei seiden to hym, For yistirdai in the seuenthe our the feuer lefte him.
26204	43	4	53	Therfor the fadir knewe, that thilke our it was, in which Jhesus seide to hym, Thi sone lyueth; and he bileuede, and al his hous.
26205	43	4	54	Jhesus dide eft this secounde tokene, whanne he cam fro Judee in to Galilee.
26206	43	5	1	Aftir these thingis ther was a feeste dai of Jewis, and Jhesus wente vp to Jerusalem.
26207	43	5	2	And in Jerusalem is a waissynge place, that in Ebrew is named Bethsaida, and hath fyue porchis.
26208	43	5	3	In these lay a greet multitude of sike men, blynde, crokid, and drie, abidynge the mouyng of the watir.
26209	43	5	4	For the aungel `of the Lord cam doun certeyne tymes in to the watir, and the watir was moued; and he that first cam doun in to the sisterne, aftir the mouynge of the watir, was maad hool of what euer sijknesse he was holdun.
26210	43	5	5	And a man was there, hauynge eiyte and thritti yeer in his sikenesse.
26211	43	5	6	And whanne Jhesus hadde seyn hym liggynge, and hadde knowun, that he hadde myche tyme, he seith to hym, Wolt thou be maad hool?
26212	43	5	7	The sijk man answerde to hym, Lord, Y haue no man, that whanne the watir is moued, to putte me `in to the cisterne; for the while Y come, anothir goith doun bifor me.
26213	43	5	8	Jhesus seith to hym, Rise vp, take thi bed, and go.
26214	43	5	9	And anoon the man was maad hool, and took vp his bed, and wente forth. And it was sabat in that dai.
26215	43	5	10	Therfor the Jewis seiden to him that was maad hool, It is sabat, it is not leueful to thee, to take awei thi bed.
26216	43	5	11	He answeride to hem, He that made me hool, seide to me, Take thi bed, and go.
26217	43	5	12	Therfor thei axiden him, What man `is that, that seide to thee, Take vp thi bed, and go?
26218	43	5	13	But he that was maad hool, wiste not who it was. And Jhesus bowide awei fro the puple, that was set in the place.
26219	43	5	14	Aftirward Jhesus foond hym in the temple, and seide to hym, Lo! thou art maad hool; now nyle thou do synne, lest any worse thing bifalle to thee.
26220	43	5	15	Thilke man wente, and telde to the Jewis, that it was Jhesu that made hym hool.
26221	43	5	16	Therfor the Jewis pursueden Jhesu, for he dide this thing in the sabat.
26222	43	5	17	And Jhesus answeride to hem, My fadir worchith til now, and Y worche.
26223	43	5	18	Therfor the Jewis souyten more to sle hym, for not oneli he brak the sabat, but he seide that God was his fadir, and made hym euene to God.
26224	43	5	19	Therfor Jhesus answerde, and seide to hem, Treuli, treuli, Y seye to you, the sone may not of hym silf do ony thing, but that thing that he seeth the fadir doynge; for what euere thingis he doith, the sone doith in lijk maner tho thingis.
26225	43	5	20	For the fadir loueth the sone, and schewith to hym alle thingis that he doith; and he schal schewe to hym grettere werkis than these, that ye wondren.
26226	43	5	21	For as the fadir reisith deed men, and quykeneth, so the sone quykeneth whom he wole.
26227	43	5	22	For nethir the fadir iugith ony man, but hath youun ech doom to the sone,
26228	43	5	23	that alle men onoure the sone, as thei onouren the fadir. He that onourith not the sone, onourith not the fadir that sente hym.
26229	43	5	24	Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, that he that herith my word, and bileueth to hym that sente me, hath euerlastynge lijf, and he cometh not in to doom, but passith fro deeth in to lijf.
26230	43	5	25	Treuli, treuli Y seie to you, for the our cometh, and now it is, whanne deed men schulen here the vois of `Goddis sone, and thei that heren, schulen lyue.
26231	43	5	26	For as the fadir hath lijf in hym silf, so he yaf to the sone, to haue lijf in him silf;
26232	43	5	27	and he yaf to hym power to make doom, for he is mannys sone.
26233	43	5	28	Nyle ye wondre this, for the our cometh, in which alle men that ben in birielis, schulen here the voice of Goddis sone.
26234	43	5	29	And thei that han do goode thingis, schulen go in to ayenrisyng of lijf; but thei that han done yuele thingis, in to ayenrisyng of doom.
26235	43	5	30	Y may no thing do of my silf, but as Y here, Y deme, and my doom is iust, for Y seke not my wille, but the wille of the fadir that sente me.
26236	43	5	31	If Y bere witnessing of my silf, my witnessyng is not trewe;
26237	43	5	32	another is that berith witnessyng of me, and Y woot that his witnessyng is trewe, that he berith of me.
26238	43	5	33	Ye senten to Joon, and he bar witnessyng to treuthe.
26239	43	5	34	But Y take not witnessyng of man; but Y seie these thingis, that ye be saaf.
26240	43	5	35	He was a lanterne brennynge and schynynge; but ye wolden glade at an our in his liyt.
26241	43	5	36	But Y haue more witnessyng than Joon, for the werkis that my fadir yaf to me to perfourme hem, thilke werkis that Y do beren witnessyng of me, that the fadir sente me.
26242	43	5	37	And the fadir that sente me, he bar witnessyng of me. Nether ye herden euere his vois, nether ye seien his licnesse.
26243	43	5	38	And ye han not his word dwellynge in you; for ye byleuen not to hym, whom he sente.
26244	43	5	39	Seke ye scripturis, in which ye gessen to haue euerlastynge lijf; and tho it ben, that beren witnessyng of me.
26245	43	5	40	And ye wolen not come to me, that ye haue lijf.
26246	43	5	41	Y take not clerenesse of men;
26247	43	5	42	but Y haue knowun you, that ye han not the loue of God in you.
26248	43	5	43	Y cam in the name of my fadir, and ye token not me. If another come in his owne name, ye schulen resseyue hym.
26249	43	5	44	Hou moun ye bileue, that resseyuen glorie ech of othere, and ye seken not the glorie `that is of God aloone?
26250	43	5	45	Nyle ye gesse, that Y am to accuse you anentis the fadir; it is Moises that accusith you, in whom ye hopen.
26251	43	5	46	For if ye bileueden to Moises, perauenture ye schulden bileue also to me; for he wroot of me.
26252	43	5	47	But if ye bileuen not to hise lettris, hou schulen ye bileue to my wordis?
26253	43	6	1	Aftir these thingis Jhesus wente ouere the see of Galilee, that is Tiberias.
26254	43	6	2	And a greet multitude suede hym; for thei sayn the tokenes, that he dide on hem that weren sijke.
26255	43	6	3	Therfor Jhesus wente in to an hil, and sat there with hise disciplis.
26256	43	6	4	And the paske was ful niy, a feeste dai of the Jewis.
26257	43	6	5	Therfor whanne Jhesus hadde lift vp hise iyen, and hadde seyn, that a greet multitude cam to hym, he seith to Filip, Wherof schulen we bie looues, that these men ete?
26258	43	6	6	But he seide this thing, temptynge hym; for he wiste what he was to do.
26259	43	6	7	Filip answerde to hym, The looues of tweyn hundrid pans sufficen not to hem, that ech man take a litil what.
26260	43	6	8	Oon of hise disciplis, Andrew, the brothir of Symount Petre,
26261	43	6	9	seith to him, A child is here, that hath fyue barli looues and twei fischis; but what ben these among so manye?
26262	43	6	10	Therfor Jhesus seith, Make ye hem sitte to the mete. And there was myche hey in the place. And so men saten to the mete, as `fyue thousynde in noumbre.
26263	43	6	11	And Jhesus took fyue looues, and whanne he hadde do thankyngis, he departide to men that saten to the mete, and also of the fischis, as myche as thei wolden.
26264	43	6	12	And whanne thei weren fillid, he seide to hise disciplis, Gadir ye the relifs that ben left, that thei perischen not.
26265	43	6	13	And so thei gadriden, and filliden twelue cofyns of relif of the fyue barli looues and twei fischis, that lefte to hem that hadden etun.
26266	43	6	14	Therfor tho men, whanne thei hadden seyn the signe that he hadde don, seiden, For this is verili the profete, that is to come in to the world.
26267	43	6	15	And whanne Jhesus hadde knowun, that thei weren to come to take hym, and make hym kyng, he fleiy `aloone eft in to an hille.
26268	43	6	16	And whanne euentid was comun, his disciplis wenten doun to the see.
26269	43	6	17	And thei wenten vp in to a boot, and thei camen ouer the see in to Cafarnaum. And derknessis weren maad thanne, and Jhesus was not come to hem.
26270	43	6	18	And for a greet wynde blew, the see roos vp.
26271	43	6	19	Therfor whanne thei hadden rowid as fyue and twenti furlongis or thretti, thei seen Jhesus walkynge on the see, and to be neiy the boot; and thei dredden.
26272	43	6	20	And he seide to hem, Y am; nyle ye drede.
26273	43	6	21	Therfor thei wolden take hym in to the boot, and anoon the boot was at the loond, to which thei wenten.
26274	43	6	22	On `the tother dai the puple, that stood ouer the see, say, that ther was noon other boot there but oon, and that Jhesu entride not with hise disciplis in to the boot, but hise disciplis aloone wenten.
26275	43	6	23	But othere bootis camen fro Tiberias bisidis the place, where thei hadden eetun breed, and diden thankyngis to God.
26276	43	6	24	Therfor whanne the puple hadde seyn, that Jhesu was not there, nether hise disciplis, thei wenten vp in to bootis, and camen to Cafarnaum, sekynge Jhesu.
26277	43	6	25	And whanne thei hadden foundun hym ouer the see, thei seiden to hym, Rabi, hou come thou hidur?
26278	43	6	26	Jhesus answerde to hem, and seide, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, ye seken me, not for ye sayn the myraclis, but for ye eten of looues, and weren fillid.
26279	43	6	27	Worche ye not mete that perischith, but that dwellith in to euerlastynge lijf, which mete mannys sone schal yyue to you; for God the fadir hath markid hym.
26280	43	6	28	Therfor thei seiden to hym, What schulen we do, that we worche the werkis of God?
26281	43	6	29	Jhesus answerde, and seide to hem, This is the werk of God, that ye bileue to hym, whom he sente.
26282	43	6	30	Therfor thei seiden to hym, What tokene thanne doist thou, that we seen, and bileue to thee? what worchist thou?
26283	43	6	31	Oure fadris eeten manna in desert, as it is writun, He yaf to hem breed fro heuene to ete.
26284	43	6	32	Therfor Jhesus seith to hem, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, Moyses yaf you not breed fro heuene, but my fadir yyueth you veri breed fro heuene;
26285	43	6	33	for it is very breed that cometh doun fro heuene, and yyueth lijf to the world.
26286	43	6	34	Therfor thei seiden to hym, Lord, euere yyue vs this breed.
26287	43	6	35	And Jhesus seide to hem, Y am breed of lijf; he that cometh to me, schal not hungur; he that bileueth in me, schal neuere thirste.
26288	43	6	36	But Y seid to you, that ye han seyn me, and ye bileueden not.
26289	43	6	37	Al thing, that the fadir yyueth to me, schal come to me; and Y schal not caste hym out, that cometh to me.
26290	43	6	38	For Y cam doun fro heuene, not that Y do my wille, but the wille of hym that sente me.
26291	43	6	39	And this is the wille of the fadir that sente me, that al thing that the fadir yaf me, Y leese not of it, but ayen reise it in the laste dai.
26292	43	6	40	And this is the wille of my fadir that sente me, that ech man that seeth the sone, and bileueth in hym, haue euerlastynge lijf; and Y schal ayen reyse hym in the laste dai.
26293	43	6	41	Therfor Jewis grutchiden of hym, for he hadde seid, Y am breed that cam doun fro heuene.
26294	43	6	42	And thei seiden, Whether this is not Jhesus, the sone of Joseph, whos fadir and modir we han knowun. Hou thanne seith this, That Y cam doun fro heuene?
26295	43	6	43	Therfor Jhesus answerde, and seide to hem, Nyle ye grutche togidere.
26296	43	6	44	No man may come to me, but if the fadir that sente me, drawe hym; and Y schal ayen reise hym in the laste dai. It is writun in prophetis,
26297	43	6	45	And alle men schulen be able for to be tauyt `of God. Ech man that herde of the fadir, and hath lerned, cometh to me.
26298	43	6	46	Not for ony man hath sey the fadir, but this that is of God, hath sey the fadir.
26299	43	6	47	Sotheli, sotheli, Y seie to you, he that bileueth in me, hath euerlastynge lijf.
26300	43	6	48	Y am breed of lijf.
26301	43	6	49	Youre fadris eeten manna in desert, and ben deed.
26302	43	6	50	This is breed comynge doun fro heuene, that if ony man ete therof, he die not.
26303	43	6	51	Y am lyuynge breed, that cam doun fro heuene.
26304	43	6	52	If ony man ete of this breed, he schal lyue withouten ende. And the breed that Y schal yyue, is my fleisch for the lijf of the world.
26305	43	6	53	Therfor the Jewis chidden togidere, and seiden, Hou may this yyue to vs his fleisch to ete?
26306	43	6	54	Therfor Jhesus seith to hem, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, but ye eten the fleisch of mannus sone, and drenken his blood, ye schulen not haue lijf in you.
26307	43	6	55	He that etith my fleisch, and drynkith my blood, hath euerlastynge lijf, and Y schal ayen reise hym in the laste dai.
26308	43	6	56	For my fleisch is veri mete, and my blood is very drynk.
26309	43	6	57	He that etith my fleisch, and drynkith my blood, dwellith in me, and Y in hym.
26310	43	6	58	As my fadir lyuynge sente me, and Y lyue for the fadir, and he that etith me, he schal lyue for me.
26311	43	6	59	This is breed, that cam doun fro heuene. Not as youre fadris eten manna, and ben deed; he that etith this breed, schal lyue withouten ende.
26312	43	6	60	He seide these thingis in the synagoge, techynge in Cafarnaum.
26313	43	6	61	Therfor many of hise disciplis herynge, seiden, This word is hard, who may here it?
26314	43	6	62	But Jhesus witynge at hym silf, that hise disciplis grutchiden of this thing, seide to hem, This thing sclaundrith you?
26315	43	6	63	Therfor if ye seen mannus sone stiynge, where he was bifor?
26316	43	6	64	It is the spirit that quykeneth, the fleisch profitith no thing; the wordis that Y haue spokun to you, ben spirit and lijf.
26317	43	6	65	But ther ben summe of you that bileuen not. For Jhesus wiste fro the bigynnynge, which weren bileuynge, and who was to bitraye hym.
26318	43	6	66	And he seide, Therfor Y seide to you, that no man may come to me, but it were youun to hym of my fadir.
26319	43	6	67	Fro this tyme many of hise disciplis wenten abak, and wenten not now with hym.
26320	43	6	68	Therfor Jhesus seide to the twelue, Whether ye wolen also go awei?
26321	43	6	69	And Symount Petre answeride to hym, Lord, to whom schulen we gon? Thou hast wordis of euerlastynge lijf;
26322	43	6	70	and we bileuen, and han knowun, that thou art Crist, the sone of God.
26323	43	6	71	Therfor Jhesus answerde to hem, Whether Y chees not you twelue, and oon of you is a feend?
26324	43	6	72	And he seide this of Judas of Symount Scarioth, for this was to bitraye hym, whanne he was oon of the twelue.
26325	43	7	1	Aftir these thingis Jhesus walkide in to Galilee, for he wolde not walke in to Judee, for the Jewis souyten to sle hym.
26326	43	7	2	And ther was neiy a feeste dai of the Jewis, Senofegia.
26327	43	7	3	And hise britheren seiden to hym, Passe fro hennus, and go in to Judee, that also thi disciplis seen thi werkis that thou doist;
26328	43	7	4	for no man doith ony thing in hiddlis, and hym silf sekith to be opyn. If thou doist these thingis, schewe thi silf to the world.
26329	43	7	5	For nether hise britheren bileueden in hym.
26330	43	7	6	Therfor Jhesus seith to hem, My tyme cam not yit, but youre tyme is euermore redi.
26331	43	7	7	The world may not hate you, sothely it hatith me; for Y bere witnessyng therof, that the werkis of it ben yuele.
26332	43	7	8	Go ye vp to this feeste dai, but Y schal not go vp to this feeste dai, for my tyme is not yit fulfillid.
26333	43	7	9	Whanne he hadde seid these thingis, he dwelte in Galilee.
26334	43	7	10	And aftir that hise britheren weren gon vp, thanne he yede vp to the feeste dai, not opynli, but as in priuyte.
26335	43	7	11	Therfor the Jewis souyten hym in the feeste dai, and seiden, Where is he?
26336	43	7	12	And myche grutchyng was of hym among the puple. For summe seiden, That he is good; and othere seiden, Nai, but he disceyueth the puple;
26337	43	7	13	netheles no man spak opynli of hym, for drede of the Jewis.
26338	43	7	14	But whanne the myddil feeste dai cam, Jhesus wente vp in to the temple, and tauyte.
26339	43	7	15	And the Jewis wondriden, and seiden, Hou can this man lettris, sithen he hath not lerned?
26340	43	7	16	Jhesus answerde to hem, and seide, My doctryne is not myn, but his that sente me.
26341	43	7	17	If ony man wole do his wille, he schal knowe of the techyng, whethir it be of God, or Y speke of my silf.
26342	43	7	18	He that spekith of hym silf, sekith his owne glorie; but he that sekith the glorie of hym that sente hym, is sothefast, and vnriytwisnesse is not in hym.
26343	43	7	19	Whether Moises yaf not to you a lawe, and noon of you doith the lawe?
26344	43	7	20	What seken ye to sle me? And the puple answerde, and seide, Thou hast a deuel; who sekith to sle thee?
26345	43	7	21	Jhesus answerde, and seide to hem, Y haue don o werk, and alle ye wondren.
26346	43	7	22	Therfor Moises yaf to you circumcisioun; not for it is of Moyses, but of the fadris; and in the sabat ye circumciden a man.
26347	43	7	23	If a man take circumcicioun in the sabat, that the lawe of Moises be not brokun, han ye indignacioun to me, for Y made al a man hool in the sabat?
26348	43	7	24	Nile ye deme aftir the face, but deme ye a riytful doom.
26349	43	7	25	Therfor summe of Jerusalem seiden, Whethir this is not he, whom the Jewis seken to sle?
26350	43	7	26	and lo! he spekith opynli, and thei seien no thing to hym. Whether the princes knewen verili, that this is Crist?
26351	43	7	27	But we knowun this man, of whennus he is; but whanne Crist schal come, no man woot of whennus he is.
26352	43	7	28	Therfor Jhesus criede in the temple `techynge, and seide, Ye knowen me, and `ye knowen of whennus Y am; and Y cam not of my silf, but he is trewe that sente me, whom ye knowen not.
26353	43	7	29	Y knowe hym, and if Y seie that Y knowe hym not, Y schal be lijk to you, a liere; but Y knowe hym, for of hym Y am, and he sente me.
26354	43	7	30	Therfor thei souyten to take hym, and no man sette on hym hoondis, for his our cam not yit.
26355	43	7	31	And many of the puple bileueden in hym, and seiden, Whanne Crist schal come, whether he schal do mo tokenes, than tho that this doith?
26356	43	7	32	Farisees herden the puple musinge of hym these thingis; and the princis and Farisees senten mynystris, to take hym.
26357	43	7	33	Therfor Jhesus seide to hem, Yit a litil tyme Y am with you, and Y go to the fadir, that sente me.
26358	43	7	34	Ye schulen seke me, and ye schulen not fynde; and where Y am, ye may not come.
26359	43	7	35	Therfor the Jewis seiden to hem silf, Whidur schal this gon, for we schulen not fynde hym? whether he wole go in to the scateryng of hethene men, and wole teche the hethene?
26360	43	7	36	What is this word, which he seide, Ye schulen seke me, and ye schulen not fynde; and where Y am, ye moun not come?
26361	43	7	37	But in the laste dai of the greet feeste, Jhesus stood, and criede, and seide, If ony man thirstith, come he to me, and drynke.
26362	43	7	38	He that bileueth in me, as the scripture seith, Floodis of quyk watir schulen flowe fro his wombe.
26363	43	7	39	But he seide this thing of the Spirit, whom men that bileueden in hym schulden take; for the Spirit was not yit youun, for Jhesus was not yit glorified.
26364	43	7	40	Therfor of that cumpanye, whanne thei hadden herd these wordis of hym, thei seiden, This is verili a prophete.
26365	43	7	41	Othere seiden, This is Crist. `But summe seiden, Whether Crist cometh fro Galilee?
26366	43	7	42	Whether the scripture seith not, that of the seed of Dauid, and of the castel of Bethleem, where Dauid was, Crist cometh?
26367	43	7	43	Therfor discencioun was maad among the puple for hym.
26368	43	7	44	For summe of hem wolden haue take hym, but no man sette hondis on hym.
26369	43	7	45	Therfor the mynystris camen to bischopis and Farisees, and thei seiden to hem, Whi brouyten ye not hym?
26370	43	7	46	The mynystris answeriden, Neuere man spak so, as this man spekith.
26371	43	7	47	Therfor the Farisees answeriden to hem, Whether ye ben disseyued also?
26372	43	7	48	whether ony of the pryncis or of the Farisees bileueden in hym?
26373	43	7	49	But this puple, that knowith not the lawe, ben cursid.
26374	43	7	50	Nychodeme seith to hem, he that cam to hym bi nyyt, that was oon of hem, Whethir oure lawe demith a man,
26375	43	7	51	but it haue first herde of hym, and knowe what he doith?
26376	43	7	52	Thei answeriden, and seiden to hym, Whether thou art a man of Galilee also? Seke thou scripturis, and se thou, that a prophete risith not of Galilee.
26377	43	7	53	And thei turneden ayen, ech in to his hous.
26378	43	8	1	But Jhesus wente in to the mount of Olyuete.
26379	43	8	2	And eerli eft he cam in to the temple; and al the puple cam to hym; and he sat, and tauyte hem.
26380	43	8	3	And scribis and Fariseis bryngen a womman takun in auoutrye, and thei settiden hir in the myddil,
26381	43	8	4	and seiden to hym, Maystir, this womman is now takun in auoutrie.
26382	43	8	5	And in the lawe Moises comaundide vs to stoone suche; therfor what seist thou?
26383	43	8	6	And thei seiden this thing temptynge hym, that thei myyten accuse hym. And Jhesus bowide hym silf doun, and wroot with his fyngur in the erthe.
26384	43	8	7	And whanne thei abiden axynge hym, he reiside hym silf, and seide to hem, He of you that is without synne, first caste a stoon in to hir.
26385	43	8	8	And eft he bowide hym silf, and wroot in the erthe.
26386	43	8	9	And thei herynge these thingis, wenten awei oon aftir anothir, and thei bigunnen fro the eldre men; and Jhesus dwelte aloone, and the womman stondynge in the myddil.
26387	43	8	10	And Jhesus reiside hym silf, and seide to hir, Womman, where ben thei that accusiden thee? no man hath dampned thee.
26388	43	8	11	Sche seide, No man, Lord. Jhesus seide `to hir, Nethir Y schal dampne thee; go thou, and now aftirward nyle thou synne more.
26389	43	8	12	Therfor eft Jhesus spak to hem, and seide, Y am the liyt of the world; he that sueth me, walkith not in derknessis, but schal haue the liyt of lijf.
26390	43	8	13	Therfor the Fariseis seiden, Thou berist witnessyng of thi silf; thi witnessyng is not trewe.
26391	43	8	14	Jhesus answerde, and seide to hem, And if Y bere witnessyng of my silf, my witnessyng is trewe; for Y woot fro whennus Y cam, and whidur Y go.
26392	43	8	15	But ye witen not fro whennus Y cam, ne whidur Y go. For ye demen aftir the fleisch, but Y deme no man;
26393	43	8	16	and if Y deme, my doom is trewe, for Y am not aloone, but Y and the fadir that sente me.
26394	43	8	17	And in youre lawe it is writun, that the witnessyng of twei men is trewe.
26395	43	8	18	Y am, that bere witnessyng of my silf, and the fadir that sente me, berith witnessyng of me.
26396	43	8	19	Therfor thei seiden to hym, Where is thi fadir? Jhesus answeride, Nether ye knowen me, nethir ye knowen my fadir; if ye knewen me, perauenture ye schulden knowe also my fadir.
26397	43	8	20	Jhesus spak these wordis in the tresorie, techynge in the temple; and no man took hym, for his our cam not yit.
26398	43	8	21	Therfor eft Jhesus seide to hem, Lo! Y go, and ye schulen seke me, and ye schulen die in youre synne; whidur Y go, ye moun not come.
26399	43	8	22	Therfor the Jewis seiden, Whether he schal sle hym silf, for he seith, Whidur Y go, ye moun not come?
26400	43	8	23	And he seide to hem, Ye ben of bynethe, Y am of aboue; ye ben of this world, Y am not of this world.
26401	43	8	24	Therfor Y seide to you, that ye schulen die in youre synnes; for if ye bileuen not that Y am, ye schulen die in youre synne.
26402	43	8	25	Therfor thei seiden to hym, Who art thou? Jhesus seide to hem, The bigynnyng, which also speke to you.
26403	43	8	26	Y haue many thingis to speke, and deme of you, but he that sente me is sothefast; and Y speke in the world these thingis, that Y herde of hym.
26404	43	8	27	And thei knewen not, that he clepide his fadir God.
26405	43	8	28	Therfor Jhesus seith to hem, Whanne ye han areisid mannus sone, thanne ye schulen knowe, that Y am, and of my silf Y do no thing; but as my fadir tauyte me, Y speke these thingis.
26406	43	8	29	And he that sente me is with me, and lefte me not aloone; for Y do euermore tho thingis, that ben plesynge to hym.
26407	43	8	30	Whanne he spak these thingis, manye bileueden in hym.
26408	43	8	31	Therfor Jhesus seide to the Jewis, that bileueden in hym, If ye dwellen in my word, verili ye schulen be my disciplis;
26409	43	8	32	and ye schulen knowe the treuthe, and the treuthe schal make you fre.
26410	43	8	33	Therfor the Jewis answeriden to hym, We ben the seed of Abraham, and we serueden neuere to man; hou seist thou, That ye schulen be fre?
26411	43	8	34	Jhesus answeride to hem, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, ech man that doith synne, is seruaunt of synne.
26412	43	8	35	And the seruaunt dwellith not in the hows with outen ende, but the sone dwellith with outen ende.
26413	43	8	36	Therfor if the sone make you fre, verili ye schulen be fre.
26414	43	8	37	Y woot that ye ben Abrahams sones, but ye seken to sle me, for my word takith not in you.
26415	43	8	38	Y speke tho thingis, that Y say at my fadir; and ye doen tho thingis, that ye sayn at youre fadir.
26416	43	8	39	Thei answerden, and seiden to hym, Abraham is oure fadir. Jhesus seith to hem, If ye ben the sones of Abraham, do ye the werkis of Abraham.
26417	43	8	40	But now ye seken to sle `me, a man that haue spoken to you treuthe, that Y herde of God; Abraham dide not this thing.
26418	43	8	41	Ye doen the werkis of youre fadir. Therfor thei seiden to hym, We ben not borun of fornycacioun; we han o fadir, God.
26419	43	8	42	But Jhesus seith to hem, If God were youre fadir, sotheli ye schulden loue me; for Y passide forth of God, and cam; for nether Y cam of my silf, but he sente me.
26420	43	8	43	Whi knowen ye not my speche? for ye moun not here my word.
26421	43	8	44	Ye ben of the fadir, the deuel, and ye wolen do the desyris of youre fadir. He was a mansleere fro the bigynnyng, and he stood not in treuthe; for treuthe is not in hym. Whanne he spekith lesyng, he spekith of his owne; for he is a liere, and fadir of it.
26422	43	8	45	But for Y seie treuthe, ye bileuen not to me.
26423	43	8	46	Who of you schal repreue me of synne? if Y sey treuthe, whi bileuen ye not to me?
26424	43	8	47	He that is of God, herith the wordis of God; therfor ye heren not, for ye ben not of God.
26425	43	8	48	Therfor the Jewis answeriden, and seiden, Whether we seien not wel, that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a deuel?
26426	43	8	49	Jhesus answerde, and seide, Y haue not a deuel, but Y onoure my fadir, and ye han vnhonourid me.
26427	43	8	50	For Y seke not my glorye; there is he, that sekith, and demeth.
26428	43	8	51	Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, if ony man kepe my word, he schal not taste deth with outen ende.
26429	43	8	52	Therfor the Jewis seiden, Now we han knowun, that thou hast a deuel. Abraham is deed, and the prophetis, and thou seist, If ony man kepe my word, he schal not taste deth withouten ende.
26430	43	8	53	Whether thou art grettere than oure fader Abraham, that is deed, and the prophetis ben deed; whom makist thou thi silf?
26431	43	8	54	Jhesus answeride, If Y glorifie my silf, my glorie is nouyt; my fadir, is that glorifieth me, whom ye seien, that he is youre God.
26432	43	8	55	And ye han not knowun hym, but Y haue knowun hym; and if Y seie that Y knowe hym not, Y schal be a liere lich to you; but Y knowe hym, and Y kepe his word.
26433	43	8	56	Abraham, youre fadir, gladide to se my dai; and he saiy, and ioyede.
26434	43	8	57	Thanne the Jewis seiden to hym, Thou hast not yit fifti yeer, and hast thou seien Abraham?
26435	43	8	58	Therfor Jhesus seide to hem, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, bifor that Abraham schulde be, Y am.
26436	43	8	59	Therfor thei token stonys, to caste to hym; but Jhesus hidde hym, and wente out of the temple.
26437	43	9	1	And Jhesus passynge, seiy a man blynd fro the birthe.
26438	43	9	2	And hise disciplis axiden hym, Maistir, what synnede this man, or hise eldris, that he schulde be borun blynd?
26439	43	9	3	Jhesus answeride, Nether this man synnede, nether hise eldris; but that the werkis of God be schewid in hym.
26440	43	9	4	It bihoueth me to worche the werkis of hym that sente me, as longe as the dai is; the nyyt schal come, whanne no man may worche.
26441	43	9	5	As longe as Y am in the world, Y am the liyt of the world.
26442	43	9	6	Whanne he hadde seid these thingis, he spette in to the erthe, and made cley of the spotil, and anoyntide the cley on hise iyen,
26443	43	9	7	and seide to hym, Go, and be thou waisschun in the watir of Siloe, that is to seie, Sent. Thanne he wente, and waisschide, and cam seynge.
26444	43	9	8	And so neiyboris, and thei that hadden seyn him bifor, for he was a beggere, seiden, Whether this is not he, that sat, and beggide?
26445	43	9	9	Othere men seiden, That this it is; othere men seyden, Nai, but he is lijc hym.
26446	43	9	10	But he seide, That Y am. Therfor thei seiden to hym, Hou ben thin iyen openyd?
26447	43	9	11	He answerde, Thilke man, that is seid Jhesus, made clei, and anoyntide myn iyen, and seide to me, Go thou to the watre of Siloe, and wassche; and Y wente, and wasschide, and say.
26448	43	9	12	And thei seiden to hym, Where is he? He seide, Y woot not.
26449	43	9	13	Thei leden hym that was blynd to the Farisees.
26450	43	9	14	And it was sabat, whanne Jhesus made cley, and openyde hise iyen.
26451	43	9	15	Eft the Farisees axiden hym, hou he hadde seyn. And he seide to hem, He leide to me cley on the iyen; and Y wasschide, and Y se.
26452	43	9	16	Therfor summe of the Fariseis seiden, This man is not of God, that kepith not the sabat. Othere men seiden, Hou may a synful man do these signes. And strijf was among hem.
26453	43	9	17	Therfor thei seien eftsoone to the blynd man, What seist thou of hym, that openyde thin iyen? And he seide, That he is a prophete.
26454	43	9	18	Therfor Jewis bileueden not of hym, that he was blynd, and hadde seyn, til thei clepiden his fadir and modir, that hadde seyn.
26455	43	9	19	And thei axiden hem, and seiden, Is this youre sone, which ye seien was borun blynd? hou thanne seeth he now?
26456	43	9	20	His fadir and modir answeriden to hem, and seiden, We witen, that this is oure sone, and that he was borun blynd;
26457	43	9	21	but hou he seeth now, we witen neuer, or who openyde hise iyen, we witen nere; axe ye hym, he hath age, speke he of hym silf.
26458	43	9	22	His fader and modir seiden these thingis, for thei dredden the Jewis; for thanne the Jewis hadden conspirid, that if ony man knoulechide hym Crist, he schulde be don out of the synagoge.
26459	43	9	23	Therfor his fadir and modir seiden, That he hath age, axe ye hym.
26460	43	9	24	Therfor eftsoone thei clepiden the man, that was blynd, and seiden to hym, Yyue thou glorie to God; we witen, that this man is a synnere.
26461	43	9	25	Thanne he seide, If he is a synnere, Y woot neuer; o thing Y woot, that whanne Y was blynd, now Y se.
26462	43	9	26	Therfor thei seiden to hym, What dide he to thee? hou openyde he thin iyen?
26463	43	9	27	He answerde to hem, Y seide to you now, and ye herden; what wolen ye eftsoone here? whether ye wolen be maad hise discyplis?
26464	43	9	28	Therfor thei cursiden hym, and seiden, Be thou his disciple; we ben disciplis of Moises.
26465	43	9	29	We witen, that God spak to Moises; but we knowen not this, of whennus he is.
26466	43	9	30	Thilke man answeride, and seide to hem, For in this is a wondurful thing, that ye witen not, of whennus he is, and he hath openyd myn iyen.
26467	43	9	31	And we witen, that God herith not synful men, but if ony `man is worschypere of God, and doith his wille, he herith hym.
26468	43	9	32	Fro the world it is not herd, that ony man openyde the iyen of a blynd borun man; but this were of God,
26469	43	9	33	he myyt not do ony thing.
26470	43	9	34	Thei answeriden, and seiden to hym, Thou art al borun in synnes, and techist thou vs? And thei putten hym out.
26471	43	9	35	Jhesus herd, that thei hadden putte hym out; and whanne he hadde founde hym, he seide to hym, Bileuest thou in the sone of God?
26472	43	9	36	He answerde, and seide, Lord, who is he, that Y bileue in hym?
26473	43	9	37	And Jhesus seide to hym, And thou hast seyn him, and he it is, that spekith with thee.
26474	43	9	38	And he seide, Lord, Y byleue. And he felle doun, and worschipide hym.
26475	43	9	39	Therfore Jhesus seide to hym, Y cam in to this world, `in to doom, that thei that seen not, see, and thei that seen, be maad blynde.
26476	43	9	40	And summe of the Faryseis herden, that weren with hym, and thei seiden to hym, Whether we ben blynde?
26477	43	9	41	Jhesus seide to hem, If ye weren blynde, ye schulden not haue synne; but now ye seien, That we seen, youre synne dwellith stille.
26478	43	10	1	Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, he that cometh not in by the dore in to the foold of scheep, but stieth bi another weie, is a nyyt theef and a dai theef.
26479	43	10	2	But he that entrith bi the dore, is the scheepherde of the scheep.
26480	43	10	3	To this the porter openeth, and the scheep heren his vois, and he clepith his owne scheep bi name, and ledith hem out.
26481	43	10	4	And whanne he hath don out his owne scheep, he goith bifor hem, and the scheep suen hym; for thei knowun his vois.
26482	43	10	5	But thei suen not an alien, but fleen from hym; for thei han not knowun the vois of aliens.
26483	43	10	6	Jhesus seide to hem this prouerbe; but thei knewen not what he spak to hem.
26484	43	10	7	Therfor Jhesus seide to hem eftsoone, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, that Y am the dore of the scheep.
26485	43	10	8	As many as han come, weren nyyt theues and day theues, but the scheep herden not hem.
26486	43	10	9	Y am the dore. If ony man schal entre bi me, he schal be sauyd; and he schal go ynne, and schal go out, and he schal fynde lesewis.
26487	43	10	10	A nyyt theef cometh not, but that he stele, sle, and leese; and Y cam, that thei han lijf, and haue more plenteousli.
26488	43	10	11	I am a good scheepherde; a good scheepherde yyueth his lijf for hise scheep.
26489	43	10	12	But an hirid hyne, and that is not the scheepherde, whos ben not the scheep his owne, seeth a wolf comynge, and he leeueth the scheep, and fleeth; and the wolf rauyschith, and disparplith the scheep.
26490	43	10	13	And the hirid hyne fleeth, for he is an hirid hyne, and it parteyneth not to hym of the scheep.
26491	43	10	14	Y am a good scheepherde, and Y knowe my scheep, and my scheep knowen me.
26492	43	10	15	As the fadir hath knowun me, Y knowe the fadir; and Y putte my lijf for my scheep.
26493	43	10	16	Y haue othere scheep, that ben not of this foolde, and it bihoueth me to brynge hem togidir, and thei schulen here my vois; and it schal be maad o foolde and o scheepherde.
26494	43	10	17	Therfor the fadir loueth me, for Y putte my lijf, that eftsoone Y take it.
26495	43	10	18	No man takith it fro me, but Y putte it of my silf. Y haue power to putte it, and Y haue power to take it ayen. This maundement Y haue takun of my fadir.
26496	43	10	19	Eft dissencioun was maad among the Jewis for these wordis.
26497	43	10	20	And many of hem seiden, He hath a deuel, and maddith; what heren ye hym?
26498	43	10	21	Othere men seiden, These wordis ben not of a man that hath a feend. Whether the deuel may opene the iyen of blynde men?
26499	43	10	22	But the feestis of halewyng of the temple weren maad in Jerusalem, and it was wyntir.
26500	43	10	23	And Jhesus walkide in the temple, in the porche of Salomon.
26501	43	10	24	Therfor the Jewis camen aboute hym, and seiden to hym, Hou long takist thou awei oure soule? if thou art Crist, seie thou to vs opynli.
26502	43	10	25	Jhesus answerde to hem, Y speke to you, and ye bileuen not; the werkis that Y do in the name of my fadir, beren witnessyng of me.
26503	43	10	26	But ye bileuen not, for ye ben not of my scheep.
26504	43	10	27	My scheep heren my vois, and Y knowe hem, and thei suen me.
26505	43	10	28	And Y yyue to hem euerelastynge lijf, and thei schulen not perische with outen ende, and noon schal rauysche hem fro myn hoond.
26506	43	10	29	That thing that my fadir yaf to me, is more than alle thingis; and no man may rauysche fro my fadris hoond.
26507	43	10	30	Y and the fadir ben oon.
26508	43	10	31	The Jewis token vp stoonys, to stoone hym.
26509	43	10	32	Jhesus answerde to hem, Y haue schewide to you many good werkis of my fadir, for which werk of hem stonen ye me?
26510	43	10	33	The Jewis answerden to hym, We stoonen thee not of good werk, but of blasfemye, and for thou, sithen thou art a man, makist thi silf God.
26511	43	10	34	Jhesus answerde to hem, Whether it is not writun in youre lawe, That Y seide, Ye ben goddis?
26512	43	10	35	Yf he seide that thei weren goddis, to whiche the word of God was maad, and scripture may not be vndon,
26513	43	10	36	thilke that the fadir hath halewid, and hath sent in to the world, ye seien, That `thou blasfemest, for Y seide, Y am Goddis sone?
26514	43	10	37	Yf Y do not the werkis of my fadir, nyle ye bileue to me;
26515	43	10	38	but if Y do, thouy ye wolen not bileue to me, bileue ye to the werkis; that ye knowe and bileue, that the fadir is in me, and Y in the fadir.
26516	43	10	39	Therfor thei souyten to take hym, and he wente out of her hondis.
26517	43	10	40	And he wente eftsoone ouer Jordan, in to that place where Joon was firste baptisynge, and he dwelte there.
26518	43	10	41	And manye camen to hym, and seiden, For Joon dide no myracle;
26519	43	10	42	and alle thingis what euer Joon seide of this, weren sothe. And many bileueden in hym.
26520	43	11	1	And ther was a sijk man, Lazarus of Bethanye, of the castel of Marie and Martha, hise sistris.
26521	43	11	2	And it was Marye, which anoyntide the Lord with oynement, and wipte hise feet with hir heeris, whos brother Lazarus was sijk.
26522	43	11	3	Therfor hise sistris senten to hym, and seide, Lord, lo! he whom thou louest, is sijk.
26523	43	11	4	And Jhesus herde, and seide to hem, This syknesse is not to the deth, but for the glorie of God, that mannus sone be glorified bi hym.
26524	43	11	5	And Jhesus louyde Martha, and hir sistir Marie, and Lazarus.
26525	43	11	6	Therfor whanne Jhesus herde, that he was sijk, thanne he dwellide in the same place twei daies.
26526	43	11	7	And after these thingis he seide to hise disciplis, Go we eft in to Judee.
26527	43	11	8	The disciplis seien to hym, Maister, now the Jewis souyten for to stoone thee, and eft goist thou thidir?
26528	43	11	9	Jhesus answerde, Whether ther ben not twelue ouris of the dai? If ony man wandre in the dai, he hirtith not, for he seeth the liyt of this world.
26529	43	11	10	But if he wandre in the niyt, he stomblith, for liyt is not in him.
26530	43	11	11	He seith these thingis, and aftir these thingis he seith to hem, Lazarus, oure freend, slepith, but Y go to reise hym fro sleep.
26531	43	11	12	Therfor hise disciplis seiden, Lord, if he slepith, he schal be saaf.
26532	43	11	13	But Jhesus hadde seid of his deth; but thei gessiden, that he seide of slepyng of sleep.
26533	43	11	14	Thanne therfor Jhesus seide to hem opynli, Lazarus is deed;
26534	43	11	15	and Y haue ioye for you, that ye bileue, for Y was not there; but go we to hym.
26535	43	11	16	Therfor Thomas, that is seid Didymus, seide to euen disciplis, Go we also, that we dien with hym.
26536	43	11	17	And so Jhesus cam, and foond hym hauynge thanne foure daies in the graue.
26537	43	11	18	And Bethany was bisidis Jerusalem, as it were fiftene furlongis.
26538	43	11	19	And many of the Jewis camen to Mary and Martha, to coumforte hem of her brothir.
26539	43	11	20	Therfor as Martha herde, that Jhesu cam, sche ran to hym; but Mary sat at home.
26540	43	11	21	Therfor Martha seide to Jhesu, Lord, if thou haddist be here, my brother hadde not be deed.
26541	43	11	22	But now Y woot, that what euere thingis thou schalt axe of God, God schal yyue to thee.
26542	43	11	23	Jhesus seith to hir, Thi brother schal rise ayen.
26543	43	11	24	Martha seith to hym, Y woot, that he schal rise ayen in the ayen risyng in the laste dai.
26544	43	11	25	Jhesus seith to hir, Y am ayen risyng and lijf; he that bileueth in me, yhe, thouy he be deed,
26545	43	11	26	he schal lyue; and ech that lyueth, and bileueth in me, schal not die with outen ende. Bileuest thou this thing?
26546	43	11	27	Sche seith to hym, Yhe, Lord, Y haue bileued, that thou art Crist, the sone of the lyuynge God, that hast come in to this world.
26547	43	11	28	And whanne sche hadde seid this thing, sche wente, and clepide Marie, hir sistir, in silence, and seide, The maister cometh, and clepith thee.
26548	43	11	29	Sche, as sche herd, aroos anoon, and cam to hym.
26549	43	11	30	And Jhesus cam not yit `in to the castel, but he was yit in that place, where Martha hadde comun ayens hym.
26550	43	11	31	Therfor the Jewis that weren with hir in the hous, and coumfortiden hir, whanne thei sayn Marie, that sche roos swithe, and wente out, thei sueden hir, and seiden, For sche goith to the graue, to wepe there.
26551	43	11	32	But whanne Marie was comun where Jhesus was, sche seynge hym felde doun to his feet, and seide to hym, Lord, if thou haddist be here, my brother hadde not be deed.
26552	43	11	33	And therfor whanne Jhesu saiy hir wepyng, and the Jewis wepynge that weren with hir, he `made noise in spirit, and troblide hym silf,
26553	43	11	34	and seide, Where han ye leid hym? Thei seien to hym, Lord, come, and se.
26554	43	11	35	And Jhesus wepte. Therfor the Jewis seiden,
26555	43	11	36	Lo! hou he louede hym.
26556	43	11	37	And summe of hem seiden, Whethir this man that openyde the iyen of the borun blynde man, myyte not make that this schulde not die?
26557	43	11	38	Therfor Jhesus eft makynge noise in hym silf, cam to the graue. And there was a denne, and a stoon was leid theronne.
26558	43	11	39	And Jhesus seith, Take ye awey the stoon. Martha, the sistir of hym that was deed, seith to hym, Lord, he stynkith now, for he hath leye foure daies.
26559	43	11	40	Jhesus seith to hir, Haue Y not seid to thee, that if thou bileuest, thou schalt se the glorie of God?
26560	43	11	41	Therfor thei token awei the stoon. And Jhesus lifte vp hise iyen, and seide, Fadir, Y do thankyngis to thee, for thou hast herd me; and Y wiste,
26561	43	11	42	that thou euermore herist me, but for the puple that stondith aboute, Y seide, that thei bileue, that thou hast sent me.
26562	43	11	43	Whanne he hadde seid these thingis, he criede with a greet vois, Lazarus, come thou forth.
26563	43	11	44	And anoon he that was deed, cam out, boundun the hondis and feet with boondis, and his face boundun with a sudarie. And Jhesus seith to hem, Vnbynde ye hym, and suffre ye hym to go forth.
26564	43	11	45	Therfor many of the Jewis that camen to Marie and Martha, and seyn what thingis Jhesus dide, bileueden in hym.
26565	43	11	46	But summe of hem wente to the Farisees, and seiden to hem, what thingis Jhesus `hadde don.
26566	43	11	47	Therfor the bischopis and the Farisees gadriden a counsel ayens Jhesu, and seiden, What do we? for this man doith many myraclis.
26567	43	11	48	If we leeue hym thus, alle men schulen bileue in hym; and Romayns schulen come, and schulen take our place and oure folk.
26568	43	11	49	But oon of hem, Cayfas bi name, whanne he was bischop of that yeer, seide to hem,
26569	43	11	50	Ye witen nothing, ne thenken, that it spedith to you, that o man die for the puple, and that al the folc perische not.
26570	43	11	51	But he seide not this thing of hym silf, but whanne he was bischop of that yeer, he prophesiede, that Jhesu was to die for the folc,
26571	43	11	52	and not oneli for the folc, but that he schulde gadere in to oon the sones of God that weren scaterid.
26572	43	11	53	Therfor fro that day thei souyten for to sle hym.
26573	43	11	54	Therfor Jhesus walkide not thanne opynli among the Jewis; but he wente in to a cuntre bisidis desert, in to a citee, that is seid Effren, and there he dwellide with hise disciplis.
26574	43	11	55	And the pask of the Jewis was niy, and many of the cuntrey wenten vp to Jerusalem bifor the pask, to halewe hem silf.
26575	43	11	56	Therfor thei souyten Jhesu, and spaken togidere, stondynge in the temple, What gessen ye, for he cometh not to the feeste day? For the bischopis and Farisees hadden youun a maundement, that if ony man knowe where he is, that he schewe, that thei take hym.
26576	43	12	1	Therfor Jhesus bifor sixe daies of pask cam to Bethanye, where Lazarus hadde be deed, whom Jhesus reiside.
26577	43	12	2	And thei maden to hym a soopere there, and Martha mynystride to hym; and Lazarus was oon of men that saten at the mete with hym.
26578	43	12	3	Therfor Marie took a pound of oynement of trewe narde precious, and anoyntide the feet of Jhesu, and wipte hise feet with hir heeris; and the hous was fulfillid of the sauour of the oynement.
26579	43	12	4	Therfor Judas Scarioth, oon of hise disciplis, that was to bitraye hym,
26580	43	12	5	seide, Whi is not this oynement seeld for thre hundrid pens, and is youun to nedi men?
26581	43	12	6	But he seide this thing, not for it perteynede to hym of nedi men, but for he was a theef, and he hadde the pursis, and bar tho thingis that weren sent.
26582	43	12	7	Therfor Jhesus seide, Suffre ye hir, that in to the day of my biriyng sche kepe that;
26583	43	12	8	for ye schulen euermore haue pore men with you, but ye schulen not euermore haue me.
26584	43	12	9	Therfore myche puple of Jewis knew, that Jhesus was there; and thei camen, not oonli for Jhesu, but to se Lazarus, whom he hadde reisid fro deth.
26585	43	12	10	But the princis of prestis thouyten to sle Lazarus,
26586	43	12	11	for manye of the Jewis wenten awei for him, and bileueden in Jhesu.
26587	43	12	12	But on the morew a myche puple, that cam togidere to the feeste dai, whanne thei hadden herd, that Jhesus cam to Jerusalem,
26588	43	12	13	token braunchis of palmes, and camen forth ayens hym, and crieden, Osanna, blessid is the kyng of Israel, that cometh in the name of the Lord.
26589	43	12	14	And Jhesus foond a yonge asse, and sat on hym,
26590	43	12	15	as it is writun, The douytir of Syon, nyle thou drede; lo! thi kyng cometh, sittynge on `an asse fole.
26591	43	12	16	Hise disciplis knewen not first these thingis, but whanne Jhesus was glorified, thanne thei hadden mynde, for these thingis weren writun of hym, and these thingis thei diden to hym.
26592	43	12	17	Therfor the puple bar witnessyng, that was with hym, whanne he clepide Lazarus fro the graue, and reiside hym fro deth.
26593	43	12	18	And therfor the puple cam, and mette with hym, for thei herden that he hadde don this signe.
26594	43	12	19	Therfor the Farisees seiden to hem silf, Ye seen, that we profiten no thing; lo! al the world wente aftir hym.
26595	43	12	20	And there weren summe hethene men, of hem that hadden come vp to worschipe in the feeste dai.
26596	43	12	21	And these camen to Filip, that was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and preieden hym, and seiden, Sire, we wolen se Jhesu.
26597	43	12	22	Filip cometh, and seith to Andrew; eft Andrew and Filip seiden to Jhesu.
26598	43	12	23	And Jhesus answerde `to hem, and seide, The our cometh, that mannus sone be clarified.
26599	43	12	24	Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, but a corn of whete falle in to the erthe, and be deed, it dwellith aloone;
26600	43	12	25	but if it be deed, it bryngith myche fruyt. He that loueth his lijf, schal leese it; and he that hatith his lijf in this world, kepith it in to euerlastynge lijf.
26601	43	12	26	If ony man serue me, sue he me; and where Y am, there my mynystre schal be. If ony man serue me, my fadir schal worschipe hym.
26602	43	12	27	Now my soule is troublid, and what schal Y seie? Fadir, saue me fro this our; but therfor Y cam in to this our;
26603	43	12	28	fadir, clarifie thi name. And a vois cam fro heuene, and seide, And Y haue clarified, and eft Y schal clarifie.
26604	43	12	29	Therfor the puple that stood, and herde, seide, that `thundur was maad; othere men seide, an aungel spak to hym.
26605	43	12	30	Jhesus answerde, and seide, This vois cam not for me, but for you.
26606	43	12	31	Now is the doom of the world, now the prince of this world schal be cast out.
26607	43	12	32	And if Y schal be enhaunsid fro the erthe, Y schal drawe alle thingis to my silf.
26608	43	12	33	And he seide this thing, signifiynge bi what deth he `was to die.
26609	43	12	34	And the puple answeride to hym, We han herd of the lawe, that Crist dwellith with outen ende; and hou seist thou, It bihoueth mannys sone to be arerid?
26610	43	12	35	Who is this mannus sone? And thanne Jhesus seith to hem, Yit a litil liyt is in you; walke ye, the while ye han liyt, that derknessis catche you not; he that wandrith in derknessis, woot nere whidur he goith.
26611	43	12	36	While ye han liyt, bileue ye in liyt, that ye be the children of liyt. Jhesus spak these thingis, and wente, and hidde hym fro hem.
26612	43	12	37	And whanne he hadde don so many myraclis bifor hem, thei bileueden not `in to hym;
26613	43	12	38	that the word of Ysaie, the prophete, schulde be fulfillid, which he seide, Lord, who bileuede to oure heryng, and to whom is the arm of the Lord schewid?
26614	43	12	39	Therfor thei myyten not bileue, for eft Ysaye seide,
26615	43	12	40	He hath blyndid her iyen, and he hath maad hard the herte of hem, that thei se not with iyen, and vndurstonde with herte; and that thei be conuertid, and Y heele hem.
26616	43	12	41	Ysaye seide these thingis, whanne he say the glorie of hym, and spak of hym.
26617	43	12	42	Netheles `of the pryncis manye bileueden in hym, but for the Farisees thei knowlechiden not, that thei schulden not be put out of the synagoge;
26618	43	12	43	for thei loueden the glorie of men, more than the glorie of God.
26619	43	12	44	And Jhesus criede, and seide, He that bileueth in me, bileueth not in me, but in hym that sente me.
26620	43	12	45	He that seeth me, seeth hym that sente me.
26621	43	12	46	Y liyt cam in to the world, that ech that bileueth in me, dwelle not in derknessis.
26622	43	12	47	And if ony man herith my words, and kepith hem, Y deme hym not; for Y cam not, that Y deme the world, but that Y make the world saaf.
26623	43	12	48	He that dispisith me, and takith not my wordis, hath hym that schal iuge hym; thilke word that Y haue spokun, schal deme hym in the last dai.
26624	43	12	49	For Y haue not spokun of my silf, but thilke fadir that sente me, yaf to me a maundement, what Y schal seie, and what Y schal speke.
26625	43	12	50	And Y woot, that his maundement is euerlastynge lijf; therfor tho thingis that Y speke, as the fadir seide to me, so Y speke.
26626	43	13	1	Bifor the `feeste dai of pask Jhesus witynge, that his our is comun, that he passe fro this world to the fadir, whanne he hadde loued hise that weren in the world, in to the ende he louede hem.
26627	43	13	2	And whanne the souper was maad, whanne the deuel hadde put than in to the herte, that Judas of Symount Scarioth schulde bitraye hym,
26628	43	13	3	he witynge that the fadir yaf alle thingis to hym in to hise hoondis, and that he wente out fro God,
26629	43	13	4	and goith to God, he risith fro the souper, and doith of hise clothis; and whanne he hadde takun a lynun cloth, he girde hym.
26630	43	13	5	And aftirward he putte watir in to a basyn, and biganne to waische the disciplis feet, and to wipe with the lynnen cloth, with which he was gird.
26631	43	13	6	And so he cam to Symount Petre, and Petre seith to hym, Lord, waischist thou my feet?
26632	43	13	7	Jhesus answerde, and seide to hym, What Y do, thou wost not now; but thou schalt wite aftirward.
26633	43	13	8	Petre seith to hym, Thou schalt neuere waische my feet. Jhesus answeride to hym, If Y schal not waische thee, thou schalt not haue part with me.
26634	43	13	9	Symount Petre seith to hym, Lord, not oneli my feet, but bothe the hoondis and the heed.
26635	43	13	10	Jhesus seide to hym, He that is waischun, hath no nede but that he waische the feet, but he is al clene; and ye ben clene, but not alle.
26636	43	13	11	For he wiste, who `was he that schulde bitraye hym; therfor he seide, Ye ben not alle clene.
26637	43	13	12	And so aftir that he hadde waischun `the feet of hem, he took hise clothis; and whanne he was set to mete ayen, eft he seide to hem, Ye witen what Y haue don to you.
26638	43	13	13	Ye clepen me maistir and lord, and ye seien wel; for Y am.
26639	43	13	14	Therfor if Y, lord and maistir, haue waischun youre feet, and ye schulen waische oon anothers feet;
26640	43	13	15	for Y haue youun `ensaumple to you, `that as I haue do to you, so do ye.
26641	43	13	16	Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, the seruaunt is not grettere than his lord, nether an apostle is grettere than he that sente hym.
26642	43	13	17	If ye witen these thingis, ye schulen be blessid, if ye doen hem.
26643	43	13	18	Y seie not of `alle you, Y woot whiche Y haue chosun; but that the scripture be fulfillid, He that etith my breed, schal reise his heele ayens me.
26644	43	13	19	Treuly, Y seie to you bifor it be don, that whanne it is don, ye bileue that Y am.
26645	43	13	20	Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, he that takith whom euere Y schal sende, resseyueth me; and he that resseyueth me, resseyueth hym that sente me.
26646	43	13	21	Whanne Jhesus hadde seid these thingis, he was troblid in spirit, and witnesside, and seide, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, that oon of you schal bitraye me.
26647	43	13	22	Therfor the disciplis lokiden togidere, doutynge of whom he seide.
26648	43	13	23	And so oon of hise disciplis was restynge in the bosum of Jhesu, whom Jhesu louede.
26649	43	13	24	Therfor Symount Petre bikeneth to hym, `and seith to hym, Who is it, of whom he seith?
26650	43	13	25	And so whanne he hadde restid ayen on the brest of Jhesu, he seith to hym, Lord, who is it?
26651	43	13	26	Jhesus answerde, He it is, to whom Y schal areche a sop of breed. And whanne he hadde wet breed, he yaf to Judas of Symount Scarioth.
26652	43	13	27	And aftir the mussel, thanne Sathanas entride in to hym. And Jhesus seith to hym, That thing that thou doist, do thou swithe.
26653	43	13	28	And noon of hem that saten at the mete wiste, wherto he seide to hym.
26654	43	13	29	For summe gessiden, for Judas hadde pursis, that Jhesus hadde seid to hym, Bie thou tho thingis, that ben nedeful to vs to the feeste dai, or that he schulde yyue sum thing to nedi men.
26655	43	13	30	Therfor whanne he hadde takun the mussel, he wente out anoon; and it was nyyt.
26656	43	13	31	And whanne he was gon out, Jhesus seide, Now mannus sone is clarified, and God is clarified in hym.
26657	43	13	32	If God is clarified in hym, God schal clarifie hym in hym silf, and anoon he schal clarifie hym.
26658	43	13	33	Litle sones, yit a litil Y am with you; ye schulen seke me, and, as Y seide to the Jewis, Whidur Y go, ye moun not come; and to you Y seie now.
26659	43	13	34	Y yyue to you a newe maundement, that ye loue togidir, as Y louede you, `and that ye loue togidir.
26660	43	13	35	In this thing alle men schulen knowe, that ye ben my disciplis, if ye han loue togidere.
26661	43	13	36	Symount Petre seith to hym, Lord, whidur goist thou? Jhesus answeride, Whidur Y go, thou mayst not sue me now, but thou schalt sue afterward.
26662	43	13	37	Petre seith to hym, Whi may Y not sue thee now? Y schal putte my lijf for thee.
26663	43	13	38	Jhesus answeride, Thou schalt putte thi lijf for me? Treuli, treuli, Y seie to thee, the cok schal not crowe, til thou schalt denye me thries. And he seith to hise disciplis.
26664	43	14	1	Be not youre herte afraied, ne drede it; ye bileuen in God, and bileue ye in me.
26665	43	14	2	In the hous of my fadir ben many dwellyngis; if ony thing lesse, Y hadde seid to you, for Y go to make redi to you a place.
26666	43	14	3	And if Y go, and make redi to you a place, eftsoones Y come, and Y schal take you to my silf, that where Y am, ye be.
26667	43	14	4	And whidur Y go, ye witen, and ye witen the weie.
26668	43	14	5	Thomas seith to hym, Lord, we witen not whidur thou goist, and hou moun we wite the weie?
26669	43	14	6	Jhesus seith to hym, Y am weie, treuthe, and lijf; no man cometh to the fadir, but bi me.
26670	43	14	7	If ye hadden knowe me, sotheli ye hadden knowe also my fadir; and aftirward ye schulen knowe hym, and ye han seyn hym.
26671	43	14	8	Filip seith to hym, Lord, schewe to vs the fadir, and it suffisith to vs.
26672	43	14	9	Jhesus seith to hym, So long tyme Y am with you, and `han ye not knowun me? Filip, he that seeth me, seeth also the fadir. Hou seist thou, schewe to vs the fadir?
26673	43	14	10	Bileuest thou not, that Y am in the fadir, and the fadir is in me? The wordis that Y speke to you, Y speke not of my silf; but the fadir hym silf dwellynge in me, doith the werkis.
26674	43	14	11	Bileue ye not, that Y am in the fadir, and the fadir is in me?
26675	43	14	12	Ellis bileue ye for thilke werkis. Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, if a man bileueth in me, also he schal do the werkis that Y do; and he schal do grettere werkis than these, for Y go to the fadir.
26676	43	14	13	And what euere thing ye axen the fadir in my name, Y schal do this thing, that the fadir be glorified in the sone.
26677	43	14	14	If ye axen ony thing in my name, Y schal do it.
26678	43	14	15	If ye louen me, kepe ye my comaundementis.
26679	43	14	16	And Y schal preye the fadir, and he schal yyue to you another coumfortour,
26680	43	14	17	the spirit of treuthe, to dwelle with you with outen ende; which spirit the world may not take, for it seeth hym not, nether knowith hym. But ye schulen knowe hym, for he schal dwelle with you, and he schal be in you.
26681	43	14	18	Y schal not leeue you fadirles, Y schal come to you.
26682	43	14	19	Yit a litil, and the world seeth not now me; but ye schulen se me, for Y lyue, and ye schulen lyue.
26683	43	14	20	In that dai ye schulen knowe, that Y am in my fadir, and ye in me, and Y in you.
26684	43	14	21	He that hath my comaundementis, and kepith hem, he it is that loueth me; and he that loueth me, schal be loued of my fadir, and Y schal loue hym, and Y schal schewe to hym my silf.
26685	43	14	22	Judas seith to hym, not he of Scarioth, Lord, what is don, that thou schalt schewe thi silf to vs, and not to the world?
26686	43	14	23	Jhesus answerde, and seide `to hym, If ony man loueth me, he schal kepe my word; and my fadir schal loue hym, and we schulen come to hym, and we schulen dwelle with hym.
26687	43	14	24	He that loueth me not, kepith not my wordis; and the word which ye han herd, is not myn, but the fadris, that sente me.
26688	43	14	25	These thingis Y haue spokun to you, dwellynge among you; but thilke Hooli Goost,
26689	43	14	26	the coumfortour, whom the fadir schal sende in my name, he schal teche you alle thingis, `and schal schewe to you alle thingis, what euere thingis Y schal seie to you.
26690	43	14	27	Pees Y leeue to you, my pees Y yyue to you; not as the world yyueth, Y yiue to you; be not youre herte affrayed, ne drede it.
26691	43	14	28	Ye han herd, that Y seide to you, Y go, and come to you. If ye loueden me, forsothe ye schulden haue ioye, for Y go to the fadir, for the fadir is grettere than Y.
26692	43	14	29	And now Y haue seid to you, bifor that it be don, that whanne it is don, ye bileuen.
26693	43	14	30	Now Y schal not speke many thingis with you; for the prince of this world cometh, and hath not in me ony thing.
26694	43	14	31	But that the world knowe, that Y loue the fadir; and as the fadir yaf a comaundement to me, so Y do. `Rise ye, go we hennus.
26695	43	15	1	Y am a very vyne, and my fadir is an erthe tilier.
26696	43	15	2	Ech braunch in me that berith not fruyt, he schal take awey it; and ech that berith fruyt, he schal purge it, that it bere the more fruyt.
26697	43	15	3	Now ye ben clene, for the word that Y haue spokun to you.
26698	43	15	4	Dwelle ye in me, and Y in you; as a braunche may not make fruyt of it silf, but it dwelle in the vyne, so nether ye, but ye dwelle in me.
26699	43	15	5	Y am a vyne, ye the braunchis. Who that dwellith in me, and Y in hym, this berith myche fruyt, for with outen me ye moun no thing do.
26700	43	15	6	If ony man dwellith not in me, he schal be caste out as a braunche, and schal wexe drie; and thei schulen gadere hym, and thei schulen caste hym in to the fier, and he brenneth.
26701	43	15	7	If ye dwellen in me, and my wordis dwelle in you, what euer thing ye wolen, ye schulen axe, and it schal be don to you.
26702	43	15	8	In this thing my fadir is clarified, that ye brynge forth ful myche fruyt, and that ye be maad my disciplis.
26703	43	15	9	As my fadir louede me, Y haue loued you; dwelle ye in my loue.
26704	43	15	10	If ye kepen my comaundementis, ye schulen dwelle in my loue; as Y haue kept the comaundementis of my fadir, and Y dwelle in his loue.
26705	43	15	11	These thingis Y spak to you, that my ioye be in you, and youre ioye be fulfillid.
26706	43	15	12	This is my comaundement, that ye loue togidere, as Y louede you.
26707	43	15	13	No man hath more loue than this, that a man putte his lijf for hise freendis.
26708	43	15	14	Ye ben my freendis if ye doen tho thingis, that Y comaunde to you.
26709	43	15	15	Now Y schal not clepe you seruauntis, for the seruaunt woot not, what his lord schal do; but Y haue clepid you freendis, for alle thingis what euere Y herde of my fadir, Y haue maad knowun to you.
26710	43	15	16	Ye han not chosun me, but Y chees you; and Y haue put you, that ye go, and brynge forth fruyt, and youre fruyt dwelle; that what euere thing ye axen the fadir in my name, he yyue to you.
26711	43	15	17	These thingis Y comaunde to you, that ye loue togidere.
26712	43	15	18	If the world hatith you, wite ye, that it hadde me in hate rather than you.
26713	43	15	19	If ye hadden be of the world, the world schulde loue that thing that was his; but for ye ben not of the world, but Y chees you fro the world, therfor the world hatith you.
26714	43	15	20	Haue ye mynde of my word, which Y seide to you, The seruaunt is not grettere than his lord. If thei han pursued me, thei schulen pursue you also; if thei han kept my word, thei schulen kepe youre also.
26715	43	15	21	But thei schulen do to you alle these thingis for my name, for thei knowen not hym that sente me.
26716	43	15	22	If Y hadde not comun, and hadde not spokun to hem, thei schulden not haue synne; but now thei haue noon excusacioun of her synne.
26717	43	15	23	He that hatith me, hatith also my fadir.
26718	43	15	24	If Y hadde not doon werkis in hem, whiche noon other man dide, thei schulden not haue synne; but now both thei han seyn, and hatid me and my fadir.
26719	43	15	25	But that the word be fulfillid, that is writun in her lawe, For thei hadden me in hate with outen cause.
26720	43	15	26	But whanne the coumfortour schal come, which Y schal sende to you fro the fadir, a spirit of treuthe, which cometh of the fadir, he schal bere witnessyng of me; and ye schulen bere witnessyng, for ye ben with me fro the bigynnyng.
26721	43	16	1	These thingis Y haue spokun to you, that ye be not sclaundrid.
26722	43	16	2	Thei schulen make you with outen the synagogis, but the our cometh, that ech man that sleeth you, deme that he doith seruyce to God.
26723	43	16	3	And thei schulen do to you these thingis, for thei han not knowun the fadir, nether me.
26724	43	16	4	But these thingis Y spak to you, that whanne the our `of hem schal come, ye haue mynde, that Y seide to you.
26725	43	16	5	Y seide not to you these thingis fro the bigynnyng, for Y was with you. And now Y go to hym that sente me, and no man of you axith me, Whidur `thou goist?
26726	43	16	6	but for Y haue spokun to you these thingis, heuynesse hath fulfillid youre herte.
26727	43	16	7	But Y seie to you treuthe, it spedith to you, that Y go; for if Y go not forth, the coumfortour schal not come to you; but if Y go forth, Y schal sende hym to you.
26728	43	16	8	And whanne he cometh, he schal repreue the world of synne, and of riytwisnesse, and of doom.
26729	43	16	9	Of synne, for thei han not bileued in me;
26730	43	16	10	and of riytwisnesse, for Y go to the fadir, and now ye schulen not se me;
26731	43	16	11	but of doom, for the prince of this world is now demed.
26732	43	16	12	Yit Y haue many thingis for to seie to you, but ye moun not bere hem now.
26733	43	16	13	But whanne thilke spirit of treuthe cometh, he schal teche you al trewthe; for he schal not speke of hym silf, but what euer thinges he schal here, he schal speke; and he schal telle to you tho thingis that ben to come.
26734	43	16	14	He schal clarifie me, for of myne he schal take, and schal telle to you.
26735	43	16	15	Alle thingis `whiche euer the fadir hath, ben myne; therfor Y seide to you, for of myne he schal take, and schal telle to you.
26736	43	16	16	A litil, and thanne ye schulen not se me; and eftsoone a litil, and ye schulen se me, for Y go to the fadir.
26737	43	16	17	Therfor summe of hise disciplis seiden togidere, What is this thing that he seith to vs, A litil, and ye schulen not se me; and eftsoone a litil, and ye schulen se me, for Y go to the fadir?
26738	43	16	18	Therfor thei seiden, What is this that he seith to vs, A litil? we witen not what he spekith.
26739	43	16	19	And Jhesus knew, that thei wolden axe hym, and he seide to hem, Of this thing ye seken among you, for Y seide, A litil, and ye schulen not se me; and eftsoone a litil, and ye schulen se me.
26740	43	16	20	Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, that ye schulen mourne and wepe, but the world schal haue ioye; and ye schulen be soreuful, but youre sorewe schal turne in to ioye.
26741	43	16	21	A womman whanne sche berith child, hath heuynesse, for hir tyme is comun; but whanne sche hath borun a sone, now sche thenkith not on the peyne, for ioye, for a man is borun in to the world.
26742	43	16	22	And therfor ye han now sorew, but eftsoone Y schal se you, and youre herte schal haue ioie, and no man schal take fro you youre ioie.
26743	43	16	23	And in that day ye schulen not axe me ony thing; treuli, treuli, `Y seie to you, if ye axen the fadir ony thing in my name, he schal yyue to you.
26744	43	16	24	`Til now ye axiden no thing in my name; `axe ye, `and ye schulen take, that youre ioie be ful.
26745	43	16	25	Y haue spokun to you these thingis in prouerbis; the our cometh, whanne now Y schal not speke to you in prouerbis, but opynli of my fadir Y schal telle to you.
26746	43	16	26	In that dai ye schulen axe in my name; and Y seie not to you, that Y schal preye the fadir of you;
26747	43	16	27	for the fadir hym silf loueth you, for ye han loued me, and han bileued, that Y wente out fro God.
26748	43	16	28	Y wente out fro the fadir, and Y cam in to the world; eftsoone Y leeue the world, and Y go to the fadir.
26749	43	16	29	Hise disciplis seiden to hym, Lo! now thou spekist opynli, and thou seist no prouerbe.
26750	43	16	30	Now we witen, that thou wost alle thingis; and it is not nede to thee, that ony man axe thee. In this thing we bileuen, that thou wentist out fro God.
26751	43	16	31	Jhesus answeride to hem, Now ye bileuen.
26752	43	16	32	Lo! the our cometh, and now it cometh, that ye be disparplid, ech in to hise owne thingis, and that ye leeue me aloone; and Y am not aloone, for the fadir is with me.
26753	43	16	33	These thingis Y haue spokun to you, that ye haue pees in me; in the world ye schulen haue disese, but trust ye, Y haue ouercomun the world.
26754	43	17	1	These thingis Jhesus spak, and whanne he hadde cast vp hise iyen in to heuene, he seide, Fadir, the our cometh, clarifie thi sone, that thi sone clarifie thee.
26755	43	17	2	As thou hast youun to hym power on ech fleisch, that al thing that thou hast youun to hym, he yyue to hem euerlastynge lijf.
26756	43	17	3	And this is euerlastynge lijf, that thei knowe thee very God aloone, and whom thou hast sent, Jhesu Crist.
26757	43	17	4	Y haue clarified thee on the erthe, Y haue endid the werk, that thou hast youun to me to do.
26758	43	17	5	And now, fadir, clarifie thou me at thi silf, with the clerenesse that Y hadde at thee, bifor the world was maad.
26759	43	17	6	Y haue schewid thi name to tho men, whiche thou hast youun to me of the world; thei weren thine, and thou hast youun hem to me, and thei han kept thi word.
26760	43	17	7	And now thei han knowun, that alle thingis that thou hast youun to me, ben of thee.
26761	43	17	8	For the wordis that thou hast youun to me, Y yaf to hem; and thei han takun, and han knowun verili, that Y wente out fro thee; and thei bileueden, that thou sentist me.
26762	43	17	9	Y preie for hem, Y preye not for the world, but for hem that thou hast youun to me, for thei ben thine.
26763	43	17	10	And alle my thingis ben thine, and thi thingis ben myne; and Y am clarified in hem.
26764	43	17	11	And now Y am not in the world, and these ben in the world, and Y come to thee. Hooli fadir, kepe hem in thi name, whiche thou yauest to me, that thei ben oon, as we ben.
26765	43	17	12	While Y was with hem, Y kepte hem in thi name; thilke that thou yauest to me, Y kepte, and noon of hem perischide, but the sone of perdicioun, that the scripture be fulfillid.
26766	43	17	13	But now Y come to thee, and Y speke these thingis in the world, that thei haue my ioie fulfillid in hem silf.
26767	43	17	14	Y yaf to hem thi word, and the world hadde hem in hate; for thei ben not of the world, as Y am not of the world.
26768	43	17	15	Y preye not, that thou take hem awei fro the world, but that thou kepe hem fro yuel.
26769	43	17	16	They ben not of the world, as Y am not of the world.
26770	43	17	17	Halewe thou hem in treuth; thi word is treuthe.
26771	43	17	18	As thou sentist me in to the world, also Y sente hem `in to the world.
26772	43	17	19	And Y halewe my silf for hem, that also thei ben halewid in treuthe.
26773	43	17	20	And Y preye not oneli for hem, but also for hem that schulden bileue in to me bi the word of hem;
26774	43	17	21	that all ben oon, as thou, fadir, in me, and Y in thee, that also thei in vs be oon; that the world bileue, that thou hast sent me.
26775	43	17	22	And Y haue youun to hem the clerenesse, that thou hast youun to me, that thei ben oon,
26776	43	17	23	as we ben oon; Y in hem, and thou in me, that thei be endid in to oon; and that the world knowe, that thou sentist me, and hast loued hem, as thou hast loued also me.
26777	43	17	24	Fadir, thei whiche thou yauest to me, Y wole that where Y am, that thei be with me, that thei see my clerenesse, that thou hast youun to me; for thou louedist me bifor the makyng of the world.
26778	43	17	25	Fadir, riytfuli the world knew thee not, but Y knew thee, and these knewen, that thou sentist me.
26779	43	17	26	And Y haue maad thi name knowun to hem, and schal make knowun; that the loue bi which thou `hast loued me, be in hem, and Y in hem.
26780	43	18	1	Whanne Jhesus hadde seid these thingis, he wente out with hise disciplis ouer the strond of Cedron, where was a yerd, in to which he entride, and hise disciplis.
26781	43	18	2	And Judas, that bitrayede hym, knew the place, for ofte Jhesus cam thidur with hise disciplis.
26782	43	18	3	Therfor whanne Judas hadde takun a cumpany of knyytis, and mynystris of the bischopis and of the Fariseis, he cam thidur with lanternys, and brondis, and armeris.
26783	43	18	4	And so Jhesus witynge alle thingis that weren to come on hym, wente forth, and seide to hem, Whom seken ye?
26784	43	18	5	Thei answeriden to hym, Jhesu of Nazareth. Jhesus seith to hem, Y am. And Judas that bitraiede hym, stood with hem.
26785	43	18	6	And whanne he seide to hem, Y am, thei wenten abak, and fellen doun on the erthe.
26786	43	18	7	And eft he axide hem, Whom seken ye? And thei seiden, Jhesu of Nazareth.
26787	43	18	8	He answeride to hem, Y seide to you, that Y am; therfor if ye seken me, suffre ye these to go awei.
26788	43	18	9	That the word which he seide schulde be fulfillid, For Y loste not ony of hem, whiche thou `hast youun to me.
26789	43	18	10	Therfor Symount Petre hadde a swerd, and drow it out, and smoot the seruaunt of the bischop, and kittide of his riyt eer. And the name of the seruaunt was Malcus.
26790	43	18	11	Therfor Jhesus seide to Petre, Putte thou thi swerd in to thi schethe; wolt thou not, that Y drynke the cuppe, that my fadir yaf to me?
26791	43	18	12	Therfor the cumpenye of knyytis, and the tribune, and the mynystris of the Jewis, token Jhesu, and bounden hym,
26792	43	18	13	and ledden hym first to Annas; for he was fadir of Caifas wijf, that was bischop of that yeer.
26793	43	18	14	And it was Caifas, that yaf counsel to the Jewis, that it spedith, that o man die for the puple.
26794	43	18	15	But Symount Petre suede Jhesu, and another disciple; and thilke disciple was knowun to the bischop. And he entride with Jhesu, in to the halle of the bischop;
26795	43	18	16	but Petre stood at the dore with outforth. Therfor `the tother disciple, that was knowun to the bischop, wente out, and seide to the womman that kepte the dore, and brouyte in Petre.
26796	43	18	17	And the damysel, kepere of the dore, seide to Petre, Whether thou art also of this mannys disciplis? He seide, Y am not.
26797	43	18	18	And the seruantis and mynystris stooden at the coolis, for it was coold, and thei warmyden hem; and Petre was with hem, stondynge and warmynge hym.
26798	43	18	19	And the bischop axide Jhesu of hise disciplis, and of his techyng.
26799	43	18	20	Jhesus answerde to hym, Y haue spokun opynli to the world; Y tauyte euermore in the synagoge, and in the temple, whider alle the Jewis camen togidere, and in hiddlis Y spak no thing.
26800	43	18	21	What axist thou me? axe hem that herden, what Y haue spokun to hem; lo! thei witen, what thingis Y haue seid.
26801	43	18	22	Whanne he hadde seid these thingis, oon of the mynystris stondynge niy, yaf a buffat to Jhesu, and seide, Answerist thou so to the bischop?
26802	43	18	23	Jhesus answeride to hym, If Y haue spokun yuel, bere thou witnessyng of yuel; but if Y seide wel, whi smytist thou me?
26803	43	18	24	And Annas sente hym boundun to Caifas, the bischop.
26804	43	18	25	And Symount Petre stood, and warmyde him; and thei seiden to hym, Whether also thou art his disciple? He denyede, and seide, Y am not.
26805	43	18	26	Oon of the bischops seruantis, cosyn of hym, whos eere Petre kitte of, seide, Say Y thee not in the yerd with hym?
26806	43	18	27	And Petre eftsoone denyede, and anoon the cok crew.
26807	43	18	28	Thanne thei ledden Jhesu to Cayfas, in to the moot halle; and it was eerli, and thei entriden not in to the moot halle, that thei schulden not be defoulid, but that thei schulden ete pask.
26808	43	18	29	Therfor Pilat wente out with outforth to hem, and seide, What accusyng brynge ye ayens this man?
26809	43	18	30	Thei answeriden, and seiden to hym, If this were not a mysdoere, we hadden not bitakun hym to thee.
26810	43	18	31	Thanne Pilat seith to hem, Take ye hym, and deme ye him, after youre lawe. And the Jewis seiden to hym, It is not leueful to vs to sle ony man;
26811	43	18	32	that the word of Jhesu schulde be fulfillid, whiche he seide, signifiynge bi what deth he schulde die.
26812	43	18	33	Therfor eftsoone Pilat entride in to the moot halle, and clepide Jhesu, and seide to hym, Art thou kyng of Jewis?
26813	43	18	34	Jhesus answerde, and seide to hym, Seist thou this thing of thi silf, ether othere han seid to thee of me?
26814	43	18	35	Pilat answeride, Whether Y am a Jewe? Thi folc and bischops bitoken thee to me; what hast thou don?
26815	43	18	36	Jhesus answeride, My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, my mynystris schulden stryue, that Y schulde not be takun to the Jewis; but now my kingdom is not here.
26816	43	18	37	And so Pilat seide to hym, Thanne `thou art a king. Jhesus answeride, Thou seist, that Y am a king. To this thing Y am borun, and to this Y `am comun in to the world, to bere witnessing to treuthe. Eche that is of treuthe, herith my vois.
26817	43	18	38	Pilat seith to hym, What is treuthe? And whanne he hadde seid this thing, eft he wente out to the Jewis, and seide to hem, Y fynde no cause in hym.
26818	43	18	39	But it is a custom to you, that Y delyuere oon to you in pask; therfor wole ye that Y delyuere to you the kyng of Jewis?
26819	43	18	40	Alle crieden eftsoone, and seiden, Not this, but Baraban. And Barabas was a theef.
26820	43	19	1	Therfor Pilat took thanne Jhesu, and scourgide.
26821	43	19	2	And kniytis writhen a coroun of thornes, and setten on his heed, and diden aboute hym a cloth of purpur,
26822	43	19	3	and camen to him, and seiden, Heil, kyng of Jewis. And thei yauen to him buffatis.
26823	43	19	4	Eftsoone Pilat wente out, and seide to hem, Lo! Y brynge hym out to you, that ye knowe, that Y fynde no cause in him.
26824	43	19	5	And so Jhesus wente out, berynge a coroun of thornes, and a cloth of purpur. And he seith to hem, Lo! the man.
26825	43	19	6	But whanne the bischopis and mynystris hadden seyn hym, thei crieden, and seiden, Crucifie, crucifie hym. Pilat seith to hem, Take ye hym, and crucifie ye, for Y fynde no cause in hym.
26826	43	19	7	The Jewis answeriden to hym. We han a lawe, and bi the lawe he owith to die, for he made hym Goddis sone.
26827	43	19	8	Therfor whanne Pilat hadde herd this word, he dredde the more.
26828	43	19	9	And he wente in to the moot halle eftsoone, and seide to Jhesu, Of whennus art thou? But Jhesus yaf noon answere to him.
26829	43	19	10	Pilat seith to him, Spekist thou not to me? Woost thou not, that Y haue power to crucifie thee, and Y haue power to delyuere thee?
26830	43	19	11	Jhesus answeride, Thou schuldist not `haue ony power ayens me, but it were youun to thee from aboue; therfor he that bitook me to thee, hath the more synne.
26831	43	19	12	Fro that tyme Pilat souyte to delyuere hym; but the Jewis crieden, and seiden, If thou delyuerist this man, thou art not the emperouris freend; for ech man that makith hym silf king, ayen seith the emperoure.
26832	43	19	13	And Pilat, whanne he hadde herd these wordis, ledde Jhesu forth, and sat for domesman in a place, that is seid Licostratos, but in Ebrew Golgatha.
26833	43	19	14	And it was pask eue, as it were the sixte our. And he seith to the Jewis, Lo! youre king.
26834	43	19	15	But thei crieden, and seiden, Take awei, take awei; crucifie him. Pilat seith to hem, Schal I crucifie youre king? The bischops answeriden, We han no king but the emperour.
26835	43	19	16	And thanne Pilat bitook him to hem, that he schulde be crucified. And thei token Jhesu, and ledden him out.
26836	43	19	17	And he bar to hym silf a cros, and wente out in to that place, that is seid of Caluarie, in Ebreu Golgatha;
26837	43	19	18	where thei crucifieden him, and othere tweyne with him, oon on this side and oon on that side, and Jhesus in the myddil.
26838	43	19	19	And Pilat wroot a title, and sette on the cros; and it was writun, Jhesu of Nazareth, king of Jewis.
26839	43	19	20	Therfor manye of the Jewis redden this title, for the place where Jhesus was crucified, was niy the citee, and it was writun in Ebreu, Greek, and Latyn.
26840	43	19	21	Therfor the bischops of the Jewis seiden to Pilat, Nyle thou write kyng of Jewis, but for he seide, Y am king of Jewis.
26841	43	19	22	Pilat answeride, That that Y haue writun, Y haue writun.
26842	43	19	23	Therfor the knyytis whanne thei hadden crucified hym, token hise clothis, and maden foure partis, to ech knyyt a part, and a coot. And the coot was without seem, and wouun al aboute.
26843	43	19	24	Therfor thei seiden togidere, Kitte we not it, but caste we lot, whos it is; that the scripture be fulfillid, seiynge, Thei partiden my clothis to hem, and on my cloth thei casten lot. And the kniytis diden these thingis.
26844	43	19	25	But bisidis the cros of Jhesu stoden his modir, and the sistir of his modir, Marie Cleofe, and Marie Maudeleyne.
26845	43	19	26	Therfor whanne Jhesu hadde seyn his modir, and the disciple stondynge, whom he louyde, he seith to hise modir, Womman, lo thi sone.
26846	43	19	27	Aftyrward he seith to the disciple, Lo! thi modir. And fro that our the disciple took hir in to his modir.
26847	43	19	28	Aftirward Jhesus witynge, that now alle thingis ben endid, that the scripture were fulfillid, he seith, Y thirste.
26848	43	19	29	And a vessel was set ful of vynegre. And thei `leiden in isope aboute the spounge ful of vynegre, and putten to his mouth.
26849	43	19	30	Therfor whanne Jhesus hadde `takun the vynegre, he seid, It is endid. And `whanne his heed was bowid doun, `he yaf vp the goost.
26850	43	19	31	Therfor for it was the pask eue, that the bodies schulden not abide on the cros in the sabat, for that was a greet sabat dai, the Jewis preiden Pilat, that the hipis of hem schulden be brokun, and thei takun awei.
26851	43	19	32	Therfor knyytis camen, and thei braken the thies of the firste, and of the tothere, that was crucified with hym.
26852	43	19	33	But whanne thei weren comun to Jhesu, as thei sayn him deed thanne, thei braken not hise thies;
26853	43	19	34	but oon of the knyytis openyde his side with a spere, and anoon blood and watir wenten out.
26854	43	19	35	And he that saiy, bare witnessyng, and his witnessing is trewe; and he woot that he seith trewe thingis, that ye bileue.
26855	43	19	36	And these thingis weren don, that the scripture schulde be fulfillid, Ye schulen not breke a boon of hym.
26856	43	19	37	And eftsoone another scripture seith, Thei schulen se in whom thei piyten thorow.
26857	43	19	38	But after these thingis Joseph of Armathi preyede Pilat, that he schulde take awei the bodi of Jhesu, for that he was a disciple of Jhesu, but priui for drede of the Jewis. And Pilat suffride. And so he cam, and took awei the bodi of Jhesu.
26858	43	19	39	And Nychodeme cam also, that hadde come to hym first bi nyyt, and brouyte a meddlynge of myrre and aloes, as it were an hundrid pound.
26859	43	19	40	And thei token the bodi of Jhesu, and boundun it in lynun clothis with swete smellynge oynementis, as it is custom to Jewis for to birie.
26860	43	19	41	And in the place where he was crucified, was a yerd, and in the yerd a newe graue, in which yit no man was leid.
26861	43	19	42	Therfor there thei putten Jhesu, for the vigilie of Jewis feeste, for the sepulcre was niy.
26862	43	20	1	And in o dai of the wouke Marie Maudeleyn cam eerli to the graue, whanne it was yit derk. And sche say the stoon moued awei fro the graue.
26863	43	20	2	Therfor sche ran, and cam to Symount Petre, and to another disciple, whom Jhesus louede, and seith to hem, Thei han takun the Lord fro the graue, and we witen not, where thei han leid hym.
26864	43	20	3	Therfor Petre wente out, and thilke other disciple, and thei camen to the graue.
26865	43	20	4	And thei tweyne runnen togidre, and thilke othere disciple ran bifor Petre, and cam first to the graue.
26866	43	20	5	And whanne he stoupide, he sai the schetis liynge, netheles he entride not.
26867	43	20	6	Therfor Symount Petre cam suynge hym, and he entride in to the graue, and he say the schetis leid,
26868	43	20	7	and the sudarie that was on his heed, not leid with the schetis, but bi it silf wlappid in to a place.
26869	43	20	8	Therfor thanne thilke disciple that cam first to the graue, entride, and sai, and bileuede.
26870	43	20	9	For thei knewen not yit the scripture, that it behofte him to rise ayen fro deth.
26871	43	20	10	Therfor the disciplis wenten eftsoone to hem silf.
26872	43	20	11	But Marie stood at the graue with outforth wepynge. And the while sche wepte, sche bowide hir, and bihelde forth in to the graue.
26873	43	20	12	And sche sai twei aungels sittinge in white, oon at the heed and oon at the feet, where the bodi of Jhesu was leid.
26874	43	20	13	And thei seien to hir, Womman, what wepist thou? Sche seide to hem, For thei han take awei my lord, and Y woot not, where thei han leid him.
26875	43	20	14	Whanne sche hadde seid these thingis, sche turnede bacward, and sai Jhesu stondinge, and wiste not that it was Jhesu.
26876	43	20	15	Jhesus seith to hir, Womman, what wepist thou? whom sekist thou? She gessynge that he was a gardynere, seith to him, Sire, if thou hast takun him vp, seie to me, where thou hast leid him, and Y schal take hym awei.
26877	43	20	16	Jhesus seith to hir, Marie. Sche `turnede, and seith to hym, Rabony, that is to seie, Maister.
26878	43	20	17	Jhesus seith to hir, Nyle thou touche me, for Y haue not yit stied to my fadir; but go to my britheren, and seie to hem, Y stie to my fadir and to youre fadir, to my God and to youre God.
26879	43	20	18	Marie Maudeleyne cam, tellinge to the disciplis, That Y sai the Lord, and these thingis he seide to me.
26880	43	20	19	Therfor whanne it was eue in that dai, oon of the sabatis, and the yatis weren schit, where the disciplis weren gaderid, for drede of the Jewis, Jhesus cam, and stood in the myddil of the disciplis, and he seith to hem, Pees to you.
26881	43	20	20	And whanne he hadde seid this, he schewide to hem hondis and side; therfor the disciplis ioieden, for the Lord was seyn.
26882	43	20	21	And he seith to hem eft, Pees to you; as the fadir sente me, Y sende you.
26883	43	20	22	Whanne he had seid this, he blewe on hem, and seide, Take ye the Hooli Goost;
26884	43	20	23	whos synnes ye foryyuen, tho ben foryouun to hem; and whos ye withholden, tho ben withholdun.
26885	43	20	24	But Thomas, oon of the twelue, that is seid Didimus, was not with hem, whanne Jhesus cam.
26886	43	20	25	Therfor the othere disciplis seiden, We han seyn the Lord. And he seide to hem, But Y se in hise hondis the fitchinge of the nailis, and putte my fyngur in to the places of the nailis, and putte myn hond in to his side, Y schal not bileue.
26887	43	20	26	And after eiyte daies eftsoone hise disciplis weren with ynne, and Thomas with hem. Jhesus cam, while the yatis weren schit, and stood in the myddil, and seide, Pees to you.
26888	43	20	27	Afterward he seith to Thomas, Putte in here thi fyngur, and se myn hondis, and putte hidur thin hond, and putte in to my side, and nyle thou be vnbileueful, but feithful.
26889	43	20	28	Thomas answeride, and seide to him, My Lord and my God.
26890	43	20	29	Jhesus seith to him, Thomas, for thou hast seyn me, thou bileuedist; blessid ben thei, that seyn not, and han bileued.
26891	43	20	30	And Jhesus dide many othere signes in the siyt of hise disciplis, whiche ben not writun in this book.
26892	43	20	31	But these ben writun, that ye bileue, that Jhesus `is Crist, the sone of God, and that ye bileuynge haue lijf in his name.
26893	43	21	1	Afterward Jhesus eftsoone schewide hym to hise disciplis, at the see of Tiberias.
26894	43	21	2	And he schewide him thus. There weren togidere Symount Petre, and Thomas, that is seid Didimus, and Nathanael, that was of the Cane of Galilee, and the sones of Zebedee, and tweyne othere of hise disciplis.
26895	43	21	3	Symount Petre seith to hem, Y go to fische. Thei seyn to hym, And we comen with thee. And `thei wenten out, `and wenten in to a boot. And in that niyt thei token no thing.
26896	43	21	4	But whanne the morewe was comun, Jhesus stood in the brenke; netheles the disciplis knewen not, that it was Jhesus.
26897	43	21	5	Therfor Jhesus seith to hem, Children, whethir ye han ony souping thing? Thei answeriden to hym, Nay. He seide to hem,
26898	43	21	6	Putte ye the nett in to the riyt half of the rowing, and ye schulen fynde. And thei puttiden the nett; and thanne thei miyten not drawe it for multitude of fischis.
26899	43	21	7	Therfor thilke disciple, whom Jhesus louede, seide to Petre, It is the Lord. Symount Petre, whanne he hadde herd that it is the Lord, girte hym with a coote, for he was nakid, and wente in to the see.
26900	43	21	8	But the othere disciplis camen bi boot, for thei weren not fer fro the lond, but as a two hundrid cubitis, drawinge the nett of fischis.
26901	43	21	9	And as thei camen doun in to the lond, thei sayn coolis liynge, and a fisch leid on, and breed.
26902	43	21	10	Jhesus seith to hem, Bringe ye of the fyschis, whiche ye han takun now.
26903	43	21	11	Symount Petre wente vp, and drowy the nett in to the lond, ful of grete fischis, an hundrid fifti and thre; and whanne thei weren so manye, the nett was not brokun.
26904	43	21	12	Jhesus seith to hem, Come ye, ete ye. And no man of hem that saten at the mete, durste axe hym, Who art thou, witinge that it is the Lord.
26905	43	21	13	And Jhesus cam, and took breed, an yaf to hem, and fisch also.
26906	43	21	14	Now this thridde tyme Jhesus was schewid to hise disciplis, whanne he hadde risun ayen fro deth.
26907	43	21	15	And whanne thei hadde etun, Jhesus seith to Simount Petre, Symount of Joon, louest thou me more than these? He seith to him, Yhe, Lord, thou woost that Y loue thee. Jhesus seith to hym, Fede thou my lambren.
26908	43	21	16	Eft he seith to hym, Symount of Joon, louest thou me? He seith to him, Yhe, Lord, thou woost that Y loue thee. He seith to him, Fede thou my lambren.
26909	43	21	17	He seith to him the thridde tyme, Simount of Joon, louest thou me? Petre was heuy, for he seith to hym the thridde tyme, Louest thou me, and he seith to him, Lord, thou knowist alle thingis; thou woost that Y loue thee. Jhesus seith to hym, Fede my scheep.
26910	43	21	18	Treuli, treuli, Y seie to thee, whanne thou were yongere, thou girdidist thee, and wandridist where thou woldist; but whanne thou schalt waxe eldere, thou schalt holde forth thin hondis, and another schal girde thee, and schal lede thee whidur thou wolt not.
26911	43	21	19	He seide this thing, signifynge bi what deth he schulde glorifie God. And whanne he hadde seid these thingis, he seith to hym, Sue thou me.
26912	43	21	20	Petre turnede, and say thilke disciple suynge, whom Jhesus louede, which also restid in the soper on his brest, and he seide to hym, Lord, who is it, that schal bitraie thee?
26913	43	21	21	Therfor whanne Petre hadde seyn this, he seith to Jhesu, Lord, but what this?
26914	43	21	22	Jhesus seith to him, So I wole that he dwelle til that Y come, what to thee? sue thou me.
26915	43	21	23	Therfor this word wente out among the britheren, that thilke disciple dieth not. And Jhesus seide not to hym, that he dieth not, but, So Y wole that he dwelle til Y come, what to thee?
26916	43	21	24	This is thilke disciple, that berith witnessyng of these thingis, and wroot hem; and we witen, that his witnessyng is trewe.
26917	43	21	25	And ther ben also manye othere thingis that Jhesus dide, whiche if thei ben writun bi ech bi hym silf, Y deme that the world hym silf schal not take tho bookis, that ben to be writun.
26918	44	1	1	Theofle, first `Y made a sermoun of alle thingis, that Jhesu bigan to do and to teche,
26919	44	1	2	in to the daie of his ascencioun, in which he comaundide bi the Hooli Goost to hise apostlis, whiche he hadde chosun;
26920	44	1	3	to whiche he schewide hym silf `alyue aftir his passioun, by many argumentis, apperinge to hem fourti daies, and spekinge of the rewme of God.
26921	44	1	4	And he ete with hem, and comaundide, that thei schulden not departe fro Jerusalem, but abide the biheest of the fadir, which ye herden, he seide, bi my mouth;
26922	44	1	5	for Joon baptiside in watir, but ye schulen be baptisid in the Hooli Goost, aftir these fewe daies.
26923	44	1	6	Therfor thei that weren come to gidere, axiden hym, and seiden, Lord, whether in this time thou schalt restore the kingdom of Israel?
26924	44	1	7	And he seide to hem, It is not youre to knowe the tymes ether momentis, whiche the fadir hath put in his power;
26925	44	1	8	but ye schulen take the vertu of the Hooli Goost comynge fro aboue in to you, and ye schulen be my witnessis in Jerusalem, and in al Judee, and Samarie, and to the vtmeste of the erthe.
26926	44	1	9	And whanne he had seid these thingis, in her siyt he was lift vp, and a cloude resseyuede him fro her iyen.
26927	44	1	10	And whanne thei biheelden hym goynge in to heuene, lo! `twei men stoden bisidis hem in white clothing, and seiden,
26928	44	1	11	Men of Galile, what stonden ye biholdinge in to heuene? This Jhesu, which is takun vp `fro you in to heuene, schal come, as ye seyn hym goynge in to heuene.
26929	44	1	12	Thanne thei turneden ayen to Jerusalem, fro the hille that is clepid `the hille of Olyuete, which is bisidis Jerusalem an halidaies iourney.
26930	44	1	13	And whanne thei weren entrid in to the hous, where thei dwelliden, thei wenten vp in to the soler, Petir and Joon, James and Andreu, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matheu, James of Alphei, and Symount Zelotes, and Judas of James.
26931	44	1	14	Alle these weren lastingli contynuynge with o wille in preier, with wymmen, and Marie, the moder of Jhesu, and with hise britheren.
26932	44	1	15	In tho daies Petre roos vp in the myddil of the britheren, and seide; and ther was a company of men togidere, almest an hundrid and twenti;
26933	44	1	16	Britheren, it bihoueth that the scripture be fillid, whiche the Hooly Goost bifore seide bi the mouth of Dauith, of Judas that was ledere of hem that token Jhesu;
26934	44	1	17	and was noumbrid among vs, and gat a part of this seruyce.
26935	44	1	18	And this Judas hadde a feeld of the hire of wickidnesse, and he was hangid, and `to-brast the myddil, and alle hise entrailes weren sched abrood.
26936	44	1	19	And it was maad knowun to alle men that dwelten in Jerusalem, so that the ilke feeld was clepid Acheldemak in the langage of hem, that is, the feeld of blood.
26937	44	1	20	And it is writun in the book of Salmes, The abitacioun of hem be maad desert, and be ther noon that dwelle in it, and an other take his bishopriche.
26938	44	1	21	Therfor it bihoueth of these men, that ben gaderid togidere with vs in al the tyme, in which the Lord Jhesu entride, and wente out among vs,
26939	44	1	22	and bigan fro the baptym of Joon til in to the dai in which he was takun vp fro vs, that oon of these be maad a witnesse of his resurreccioun with vs.
26940	44	1	23	And thei ordeyneden tweyn, Joseph, that was clepid Barsabas, that was named Just, and Mathie.
26941	44	1	24	And thei preieden, and seiden, Thou, Lord, that knowist the hertis of alle men, schewe whom thou hast chosun of these tweyne,
26942	44	1	25	that oon take the place of this seruyce and apostlehed, of which Judas trespasside, that he schulde go in to his place.
26943	44	1	26	And thei yauen lottis to hem, and the lot felde on Mathie; and he was noumbrid with enleuen apostlis.
26944	44	2	1	And whanne the daies of Pentecost weren fillid, alle the disciplis weren togidre in the same place.
26945	44	2	2	And sodeynli ther was maad a sown fro heuene, as of a greet wynde comynge, and it fillide al the hous where thei saten.
26946	44	2	3	And diuerse tungis as fier apperiden to hem, and it sat on ech of hem.
26947	44	2	4	And alle weren fillid with the Hooli Goost, and thei bigunnen to speke diuerse langagis, as the Hooli Goost yaf to hem for to speke.
26948	44	2	5	And ther weren in Jerusalem dwellinge Jewis, religiouse men, of ech nacioun that is vndur heuene.
26949	44	2	6	And whanne this vois was maad, the multitude cam togidere, and thei weren astonyed in thouyt, for ech man herde hem spekinge in his langage.
26950	44	2	7	And alle weren astonyed, and wondriden, and seiden togidere, Whether not alle these that speken ben men of Galyle,
26951	44	2	8	and hou herden we ech man his langage in which we ben borun?
26952	44	2	9	Parthi, and Medi, and Elamyte, and thei that dwellen at Mesopotami, Judee, and Capodosie, and Ponte,
26953	44	2	10	and Asie, Frigie, and Pamfilie, Egipt, and the parties of Libie, that is aboue Sirenen, and `comelingis Romayns, and Jewis,
26954	44	2	11	and proselitis, men of Crete, and of Arabie, we han herd hem spekynge in oure langagis the grete thingis of God.
26955	44	2	12	And alle weren astonyed, and wondriden, `and seiden togidere, What wole this thing be?
26956	44	2	13	And othere scorneden, and seiden, For these men ben ful of must.
26957	44	2	14	But Petre stood with the enleuene, and reiside vp his vois, and spak to hem, Ye Jewis, and alle that dwellen at Jerusalem, be this knowun to you, and with eris perseyue ye my wordis.
26958	44	2	15	For not as ye wenen, these ben dronkun, whanne it is the thridde our of the dai;
26959	44	2	16	but this it is, that was seid bi the prophete Johel,
26960	44	2	17	And it schal be in the laste daies, the Lord seith, Y schal helde out my spirit on ech fleisch; and youre sones and youre douytris schulen prophesie, and youre yonge men schulen se visiouns, and youre eldris schulen dreme sweuenes.
26961	44	2	18	And on my seruauntis and myn handmaidens in tho daies Y schal schede out of my spirit, and thei schulen prophecie.
26962	44	2	19	And Y schal yyue grete wondris in heuene aboue, and signes in erthe bynethe, blood, and fier, and heete of smoke.
26963	44	2	20	The sunne schal be turned in to derknessis, and the moone in to blood, bifor that the greet and the opyn dai of the Lord come.
26964	44	2	21	And it schal be, ech man which euere schal clepe to help the name of the Lord, schal be saaf.
26965	44	2	22	Ye men of Israel, here ye these wordis. Jhesu of Nazareth, a man preued of God bifor you bi vertues, and wondris, and tokenes, which God dide bi hym in the myddil of you,
26966	44	2	23	as ye witen, ye turmentiden, and killiden hym bi the hoondis of wyckid men, bi counseil determyned and bitakun bi the forknouwyng of God.
26967	44	2	24	Whom God reiside, whanne sorewis of helle weren vnboundun, bi that that it was impossible that he were holdun of it.
26968	44	2	25	For Dauid seith of hym, Y saiy afer the Lord bifore me euermore, for he is on my riythalf, that Y be not mouyd.
26969	44	2	26	For this thing myn herte ioiede, and my tunge made ful out ioye, and more ouere my fleisch schal reste in hope.
26970	44	2	27	For thou schalt not leeue my soule in helle, nethir thou schalt yiue thin hooli to se corrupcioun.
26971	44	2	28	Thou hast maad knowun to me the weies of lijf, thou schalt fille me in myrthe with thi face.
26972	44	2	29	Britheren, be it leueful boldli to seie to you of the patriark Dauid, for he is deed and biried, and his sepulcre is among vs in to this dai.
26973	44	2	30	Therfore whanne he was a prophete, and wiste, that with a greet ooth God hadde sworn to hym, that of the fruyt of his leende schulde oon sitte on his seete,
26974	44	2	31	he seynge afer spak of the resurreccioun of Crist, for nether he was left in helle, nether his fleisch saiy corrupcioun.
26975	44	2	32	God reiside this Jhesu, to whom we alle ben witnessis.
26976	44	2	33	Therfor he was enhaunsid bi the riythoond of God, and thorouy the biheest of the Hooli Goost that he took of the fadir, he schedde out this spirit, that ye seen and heren.
26977	44	2	34	For Dauid stiede not in to heuene; but he seith, The Lord seide to my Lord,
26978	44	2	35	Sitte thou on my riyt half, til Y putte thin enemyes a stool of thi feet.
26979	44	2	36	Therfor moost certeynli wite al the hous of Israel, that God made hym bothe Lord and Crist, this Jhesu, whom ye crucefieden.
26980	44	2	37	Whanne thei herden these thingis, thei weren compunct in herte; and thei seiden to Petre and othere apostlis, Britheren, what schulen we do?
26981	44	2	38	And Petre seide to hem, Do ye penaunce, and eche of you be baptisid in the name of Jhesu Crist, in to remissioun of youre synnes; and ye schulen take the yifte of the Hooli Goost.
26982	44	2	39	For the biheest is to you, and to youre sones, and to alle that ben fer, which euer oure Lord God hath clepid.
26983	44	2	40	Also with othere wordis ful many he witnesside to hem, and monestide hem, and seide, Be ye sauyd fro this schrewid generacioun.
26984	44	2	41	Thanne thei that resseyueden his word weren baptisid, and in that dai soulis weren encreesid, aboute thre thousinde;
26985	44	2	42	and weren lastynge stabli in the teching of the apostlis, and in comynyng of the breking of breed, in preieris.
26986	44	2	43	And drede was maad to ech man. And many wondris and signes weren don bi the apostlis in Jerusalem, and greet drede was in alle.
26987	44	2	44	And alle that bileueden weren togidre, and hadden alle thingis comyn.
26988	44	2	45	Thei selden possessiouns and catel, and departiden tho thingis to alle men, as it was nede to ech.
26989	44	2	46	And ech dai thei dwelliden stabli with o wille in the temple, and braken breed aboute housis, and token mete with ful out ioye and symplenesse of herte,
26990	44	2	47	and herieden togidere God, and hadden grace to al the folk. And the Lord encreside hem that weren maad saaf, ech dai in to the same thing.
26991	44	3	1	And Petre and Joon wenten vp in to the temple, at the nynthe our of preiyng.
26992	44	3	2	And a man that was lame fro the wombe of his modir, was borun, and was leid ech dai at the yate of the temple, that is seid feir, to axe almes of men that entriden in to the temple.
26993	44	3	3	This, whanne he say Petre and Joon bigynnynge to entre in to the temple, preyede that he schulde take almes.
26994	44	3	4	And Petre with Joon bihelde on hym, and seide, Biholde thou in to vs.
26995	44	3	5	And he biheelde in to hem, and hopide, that he schulde take sumwhat of hem.
26996	44	3	6	But Petre seide, Y haue nether siluer ne gold; but that that Y haue, Y yiue to thee. In the name of Jhesu Crist of Nazareth, rise thou vp, and go.
26997	44	3	7	And he took hym bi the riythoond, and heuede hym vp; and anoon hise leggis and hise feet weren sowdid togidere;
26998	44	3	8	and he lippide, and stood, and wandride. And he entride with hem in to the temple, and wandride, and lippide, and heriede God.
26999	44	3	9	And al the puple sai hym walkinge, and heriynge God.
27000	44	3	10	And thei knewen hym, that he it was that sat at almes at the feire yate of the temple. And thei weren fillid with wondryng, and stoniynge, in that thing that byfelde to hym.
27001	44	3	11	But whanne thei sien Petre and Joon, al the puple ran to hem at the porche that was clepid of Salomon, and wondriden greetli.
27002	44	3	12	And Petre siy, and answeride to the puple, Men of Israel, what wondren ye in this thing? ether what biholden ye vs, as by oure vertue ethir power we maden this man for to walke?
27003	44	3	13	God of Abraham, and God of Ysaac, and God of Jacob, God of oure fadris, hath glorified his sone Jhesu, whom ye bitraieden, and denyeden bifor the face of Pilat, whanne he demede hym to be delyuered.
27004	44	3	14	But ye denyeden the hooli and the riytful, and axiden a mansleer to be youun to you.
27005	44	3	15	And ye slowen the maker of lijf, whom God reiside fro deth, of whom we ben witnessis.
27006	44	3	16	And in the feith of his name he hath confermyd this man, whom ye seen and knowen; the name of hym, and the feith that is bi him, yaf to this man ful heelthe in the siyt of alle you.
27007	44	3	17	And now, britheren, Y woot that bi vnwityng ye diden, as also youre princis.
27008	44	3	18	But God that bifor telde bi the mouth of alle profetis, that his Crist schulde suffre, hath fillid so.
27009	44	3	19	Therfor be ye repentaunt, and be ye conuertid, that youre synnes be don awei,
27010	44	3	20	that whanne the tymes of refresching schulen come from the siyt of the Lord, and he schal sende thilke Jhesu Crist,
27011	44	3	21	that is now prechid to you. Whom it bihoueth heuene to resseyue, in to the tymes of restitucioun of alle thingis, which the Lord spak bi the mouth of hise hooli prophetis fro the world.
27012	44	3	22	For Moises seide, For the Lord youre God schal reise to you a profete, of youre britheren; as me, ye schulen here hym bi alle thingis, what euer he schal speke to you.
27013	44	3	23	And it schal be, that euery man that schal not here the ilke profete, schal be distried fro the puple.
27014	44	3	24	And alle prophetis fro Samuel and aftirward, that spaken, telden these daies.
27015	44	3	25	But ye ben the sones of prophetis, and of the testament, that God ordeynede to oure fadris, and seide to Abraham, In thi seed alle the meynes of erthe schulen be blessid.
27016	44	3	26	God reiside his sone first to you, and sente hym blessynge you, that ech man conuerte hym from his wickidnesse.
27017	44	4	1	And while thei spaken to the puple, the preestis and magistratis of the temple, and the Saduceis camen vpon hem, and soreweden,
27018	44	4	2	that thei tauyten the puple, and telden in Jhesu the ayenrisyng fro deth.
27019	44	4	3	And thei leiden hondis on hem, and puttiden hem in to warde in to the morewe; for it was thanne euentid.
27020	44	4	4	But manye of hem that hadden herd the word, bileueden; and the noumbre of men was maad fyue thousyndis.
27021	44	4	5	And amorewe it was don, that the princis of hem, and eldre men and scribis weren gadirid in Jerusalem;
27022	44	4	6	and Annas, prince of preestis, and Caifas, and Joon, and Alisaundre, and hou manye euere weren of the kynde of preestis.
27023	44	4	7	And thei settiden hem in the myddil, and axiden, In what vertue, ether in what name, han ye don this thing?
27024	44	4	8	Thanne Petre was fillid with the Hooli Goost, and seide to hem, Ye pryncis of the puple, and ye eldre men, here ye.
27025	44	4	9	If we to dai be demyd in the good dede of a sijk man, in whom this man is maad saaf,
27026	44	4	10	be it knowun to you alle, and to al the puple of Israel, that in the name of Jhesu Crist of Nazareth, whom ye crucifieden, whom God reiside fro deth, in this this man stondith hool bifor you.
27027	44	4	11	This is the stoon, which was repreued of you bildinge, which is maad in to the heed of the corner;
27028	44	4	12	and heelthe is not in ony othir. For nether other name vndur heuene is youun to men, in which it bihoueth vs to be maad saaf.
27029	44	4	13	And thei siyen the stidfastnesse of Petre and of Joon, for it was foundun that thei weren men vnlettrid, and lewid men, and thei wondriden, and knewen hem that thei weren with Jhesu.
27030	44	4	14	And thei siyen the man that was helid, stondinge with hem, and thei myyten no thing ayenseie.
27031	44	4	15	But thei comaundiden hem to go forth with out the counsel. And thei spaken togidere,
27032	44	4	16	and seiden, What schulen we do to these men? for the signe is maad knowun bi hem to alle men, that dwellen at Jerusalem; it is opyn, and we moun not denye.
27033	44	4	17	But that it be no more pupplischid in to the puple, manasse we to hem, that thei speke no more in this name to ony men.
27034	44	4	18	And thei clepiden hem, and denounsiden to hem, that on no maner thei schulden speke, nether teche, in the name of Jhesu.
27035	44	4	19	But Petre and Joon answeriden, and seiden to hem, If it be riytful in the siyt of God to here you rather than God, deme ye.
27036	44	4	20	For we moten nedis speke tho thingis, that we han sayn and herd.
27037	44	4	21	And thei manassiden, and leften hem, and foundun not hou thei schulden punische hem, for the puple; for alle men clarifieden that thing that was don in that that was bifalle.
27038	44	4	22	For the man was more than of fourty yeer, in which this signe of heelthe was maad.
27039	44	4	23	And whanne thei weren delyuerid, thei camen to her felowis, and telden to hem, hou grete thingis the princis of preestis and the eldre men hadden seid to hem.
27040	44	4	24	And whanne thei herden, with oon herte thei reiseden vois to the Lord, and seiden, Lord, thou that madist heuene and erthe, see, and alle thingis that ben in hem, which seidist bi the Hooli Goost,
27041	44	4	25	bi the mouth of oure fadir Dauid, thi child, Whi hethen men gnastiden with teeth togidre, and the puplis thouyten veyn thingis?
27042	44	4	26	Kyngis of the erthe stoden nyy, and princis camen togidre `in to oon, ayens the Lord, and ayens his Crist.
27043	44	4	27	For verili Eroude and Pounce Pilat, with hethene men, and puplis of Israel, camen togidre in this citee ayens thin hooli child Jhesu,
27044	44	4	28	whom thou anoyntidist, to do the thingis, that thin hoond and thi counsel demyden to be don.
27045	44	4	29	And now, Lord, biholde in to the thretnyngis of hem, and graunte to thi seruauntis to speke thi word with al trist,
27046	44	4	30	in that thing that thou holde forth thin hond, that heelthis and signes and wondris be maad bi the name of thin hooli sone Jhesu.
27047	44	4	31	And whanne thei hadden preyed, the place was moued, in which thei weren gaderid; and alle weren fillid with the Hooli Goost, and spaken the word of God with trist.
27048	44	4	32	And of al the multitude of men bileuynge was oon herte and oon wille; nether ony man seide ony thingis of tho thingis that he weldide to be his owne, but alle thingis weren comyn to hem.
27049	44	4	33	And with greet vertu the apostlis yeldiden witnessyng of the ayenrysyng of Jhesu Crist oure Lord, and greet grace was in alle hem.
27050	44	4	34	For nether ony nedi man was among hem, for how manye euere weren possessouris of feeldis, ether of housis, thei seelden, and brouyten the pricis of tho thingis that thei seelden,
27051	44	4	35	and leiden bifor the feet of the apostlis. And it was departid to ech, as it was nede to ech.
27052	44	4	36	Forsothe Joseph, that was named Barsabas of apostlis, that is to seie, the sone of coumfort, of the lynage of Leuy,
27053	44	4	37	a man of Cipre, whanne he hadde a feeld, seelde it, and brouyte the prijs, and leide it bifor the feet of apostlis.
27054	44	5	1	But a man, Anany bi name, with Safira, his wijf,
27055	44	5	2	seelde a feeld, and defraudide of the prijs of the feeld; and his wijf was witinge. And he brouyte a part, and leide bifor the feet of the apostlis.
27056	44	5	3	And Petre seide to hym, Anany, whi hath Sathanas temptid thin herte, that thou lye to the Hooli Goost, and to defraude of the prijs of the feeld?
27057	44	5	4	Whethir it vnseld was not thin; and whanne it was seld, it was in thi power? Whi hast thou put this thing in thin herte? Thou hast not lied to men, but to God.
27058	44	5	5	Anany herde these wordis, and felde doun, and was deed. And greet drede was maad on alle that herden.
27059	44	5	6	And yonge men risen, and mouyden hym awei, and baren hym out, and birieden.
27060	44	5	7	And ther was maad as a space of thre ouris, and his wijf knewe not that thing that was don, and entride.
27061	44	5	8	And Petre answerde to hir, Womman, seie to me, whether ye seelden the feeld for so mych? And sche seide, Yhe, for so mych.
27062	44	5	9	And Petre seide to hyr, What bifelde to you, to tempte the spirit of the Lord? Lo! the feet of hem that han birieden thin hosebonde ben at the dore, and thei schulen bere thee out.
27063	44	5	10	Anoon sche felde doun at hise feet, and diede. And the yonge men entriden, and founden hir deed, and thei baren hir out, and birieden to hir hosebonde.
27064	44	5	11	And greet drede was maad in al the chirche, and in to alle that herden these thingis.
27065	44	5	12	And bi the hoondis of the apostlis signes and many wondris weren maad in the puple. And alle weren of oon acord in the porche of Salomon.
27066	44	5	13	But no man of othere durste ioyne hymsilf with hem, but the puple magnyfiede hem.
27067	44	5	14	And the multitude of men and of wymmen bileuynge in the Lord was more encreessid,
27068	44	5	15	so that thei brouyten out sike men in to stretis, and leiden in litle beddis and couchis, that whanne Petre cam, nameli the schadew of hym schulde schadewe ech of hem, and thei schulden be delyuerid fro her syknessis.
27069	44	5	16	And the multitude of citees niy to Jerusalem ran, bryngynge sijk men, and that weren trauelid of vnclene spiritis, whiche alle weren heelid.
27070	44	5	17	But the prince of preestis roos vp, and alle that weren with hym, that is the eresye of Saduceis, and weren fillid with enuye;
27071	44	5	18	and leiden hondis on the apostlis, and puttiden hem in the comyn warde.
27072	44	5	19	But the aungel of the Lord openyde bi nyyt the yatis of the prisoun, and ledde hem out, and seide, Go ye,
27073	44	5	20	and stonde ye, and speke in the temple to the puple alle the wordis of this lijf.
27074	44	5	21	Whom whanne thei hadden herd, thei entriden eerli in to the temple, and tauyten. And the prince of preestis cam, and thei that weren with him, and clepiden togidre the counsel, and alle the eldre men of the children of Israel; and senten to the prisoun, that thei schulden be brouyt forth.
27075	44	5	22	And whanne the mynystris camen, founden hem not, and for the prisoun was openyd, thei turneden ayen,
27076	44	5	23	and teelden, and seiden, We founden the prisoun schit with al diligence, and the keperis stondynge at the yatis; but we opneden, and founden no man ther ynne.
27077	44	5	24	And as the maiestratis of the temple, and the princis of preestis herden these wordis, thei doutiden of hem, what was don.
27078	44	5	25	But a man cam, and teelde to hem, For lo! tho men whiche ye han put in to prisoun, ben in the temple, and stonden, and techen the puple.
27079	44	5	26	Thanne the magistrat wente with the mynystris, and brouyte hem with out violence; for thei dredden the puple, lest thei schulden be stonyd.
27080	44	5	27	And whanne thei hadden brouyt hem, thei settiden hem in the counsel; and the princes of prestis axiden hem,
27081	44	5	28	and seiden, In comaundement we comaundiden you, that ye schulden not teche in this name, and lo! ye han fillid Jerusalem with youre teching, and ye wolen bringe on vs the blood of this man.
27082	44	5	29	And Petre answeride, and the apostlis, and seiden, It bihoueth to obeie to God, more than to men.
27083	44	5	30	God of oure fadris reiside Jhesu, whom ye slowen, hangynge in a tre.
27084	44	5	31	God enhaunside with his riythond this prince and sauyour, that penaunce were yyue to Israel, and remyssioun of synnes.
27085	44	5	32	And we ben witnessis of these wordis, and the Hooli Goost, whom God yaf to alle obeischinge to him.
27086	44	5	33	Whanne thei herden these thingis, thei weren turmentid, and thouyten to sle hem.
27087	44	5	34	But a man roos in the counsel, a Farise, Gamaliel bi name, a doctour of the lawe, a worschipful man to al the puple, and comaundide the men to be put without forth for a while.
27088	44	5	35	And he seide to hem, Ye men of Israel, take tent to you silf on these men, what ye schulen do.
27089	44	5	36	For bifore these daies Teodas, that seide hym silf to be sum man, to whom a noumbre of men consentiden, aboute foure hundrid; which was slayn, and alle that bileueden to hym, weren disparplit, and brouyt to nouyt.
27090	44	5	37	Aftir this, Judas of Galilee was in the daies of professioun, and turnyde awei the puple aftir hym; and alle hou manye euere consentiden to hym, weren scatered, and he perischide.
27091	44	5	38	And now therfor Y seie to you, departe ye fro these men, and suffre ye hem; for if this counsel ether werk is of men, it schal be vndon;
27092	44	5	39	but if it is of God, ye moun not vndo hem, lest perauenture ye be foundun to repugne God.
27093	44	5	40	And thei consentiden to him; and thei clepiden togidere the apostlis, and denounsiden to hem, that weren betun, that thei schulden no more speke in the name of Jhesu, and thei leten hem go.
27094	44	5	41	And thei wenten ioiynge fro the siyt of the counsel, that thei weren had worthi to suffre dispisyng for the name of Jhesu. But ech dai thei ceessiden not in the temple, and aboute housis, to teche and to preche Jhesu Crist.
27095	44	6	1	But in tho daies, whanne the noumbre of disciplis encreesside, the Grekis grutchiden ayens the Ebrews, for that her widewis weren dispisid in euery daies mynystryng.
27096	44	6	2	And the twelue clepiden togidere the multitude of disciplis, and seiden, It is not ryytful, that we leeuen the word of God, and mynystren to boordis.
27097	44	6	3	Therfor, britheren, biholde ye men of you of good fame, ful of the Hooli Goost and of wisdom, whiche we schulen ordeyne on this werk;
27098	44	6	4	for we schulen be bisi to preier, and preche the word of God.
27099	44	6	5	And the word pleside bifor al the multitude; and thei chesiden Styuen, a man ful of feith and of the Hooli Goost, and Filip, and Procore, and Nycanor, and Tymon, and Parmanam, and Nycol, a comelyng, a man of Antioche.
27100	44	6	6	Thei ordeyneden these bifor the siyt of apostlis, and thei preyeden, and leiden hoondis on hem.
27101	44	6	7	And the word of the Lord wexide, and the noumbre of the disciplis in Jerusalem was myche multiplied; also myche cumpany of preestis obeiede to the feith.
27102	44	6	8	And Steuen, ful of grace and of strengthe, made wondris and grete signes in the puple.
27103	44	6	9	But summe rysen of the synagoge, that was clepid of Libertyns, and Cirenensis, and of men of Alisaundre, and of hem that weren of Cilice and of Asie, and disputiden with Steuene.
27104	44	6	10	And thei miyten not withstonde the wisdom and the spirit, that spak.
27105	44	6	11	Thanne thei priueli senten men, that schulden seie, that thei herden hym seiynge wordis of blasfemye ayens Moises and God.
27106	44	6	12	And so thei moueden togidere the puple, and the eldre men, and the scribis; and thei rannen togidre, and token hym, and brouyten in to the counsel.
27107	44	6	13	And thei ordeyneden false witnessis, that seiden, This man ceessith not to speke wordis ayens the hooli place, and the lawe.
27108	44	6	14	For we herden hym seiynge, That this Jhesus of Nazareth schal destrye this place, and schal chaunge the tradiciouns, whiche Moyses bitook to us.
27109	44	6	15	And alle men that seten in the counsel bihelden hym, and sayn his face as the face of an aungel.
27110	44	7	1	And the prynce of prestis seide to Steuene, Whethir these thingis han hem so?
27111	44	7	2	Which seide, Britheren and fadris, here ye. God of glorie apperide to oure fadir Abraham, whanne he was in Mesopotamie, bifor that he dwelte in Carram, and seide to hym,
27112	44	7	3	Go out of thi loond, and of thi kynrede, and come in to the loond, which Y schal schewe to thee.
27113	44	7	4	Thanne he wente out of the loond of Caldeis, and dwelte in Carram. And fro thens aftir that his fader was deed, he translatide him in to this loond, in which ye dwellen now.
27114	44	7	5	And he yaf not to hym eritage in it, nethir a paas of a foot, but he bihiyte to yyue hym it in to possessioun, and to his seed aftir hym, whanne he hadde not a sone.
27115	44	7	6	And God spak to hym, That his seed schal be comling in an alien lond, and thei schulen make hem suget to seruage, and schulen yuel trete hem, foure hundrid yeris and thritti;
27116	44	7	7	and Y schal iuge the folk, to which thei schulen serue, seith the Lord. And after these thingis thei schulen go out, and thei schulen serue to me in this place.
27117	44	7	8	And he yaf to hym the testament of circumcisioun; and so he gendride Ysaac, and circumcidide hym in the eiyt dai. And Isaac gendride Jacob, and Jacob gendride the twelue patriarkis.
27118	44	7	9	And the patriarkis hadden enuye to Joseph, and selden hym in to Egipt.
27119	44	7	10	And God was with hym, and delyuerede hym of alle hise tribulaciouns, and yaf to hym grace and wisdom in the siyt of Farao, king of Egipt. And he ordeynede hym souereyn on Egipt, and on al his hous.
27120	44	7	11	And hungur cam in to al Egipt, and Canaan, and greet tribulacioun; and oure fadris founden not mete.
27121	44	7	12	But whanne Jacob hadde herd, that whete was in Egipt, he sente oure fadris first.
27122	44	7	13	And in the secounde tyme Joseph was knowun of hise britheren, and his kyn was maad knowun to Farao.
27123	44	7	14	And Joseph sente, and clepide Jacob, his fadir, and al his kynrede, seuenti and fyue men.
27124	44	7	15	And Jacob cam doun in to Egipt, and was deed, he and oure fadris;
27125	44	7	16	and thei weren translatid in to Sichen, and weren leid in the sepulcre, that Abraham bouyte bi prijs of siluer of the sones of Emor, the sone of Sichen.
27126	44	7	17	And whanne the tyme of biheeste cam niy, which God hadde knoulechid to Abraham, the puple waxede, and multipliede in Egipt,
27127	44	7	18	til another kyng roos in Egipt, which knewe not Joseph.
27128	44	7	19	This bigilide oure kyn, and turmentide oure fadris, that thei schulden putte awey her yonge children, for thei schulden not lyue.
27129	44	7	20	In the same tyme Moyses was borun, and he was louyd of God; and he was norischid thre monethis in the hous of his fadir.
27130	44	7	21	And whanne he was put out in the flood, the douyter of Farao took hym vp, and nurischide hym in to hir sone.
27131	44	7	22	And Moises was lerned in al the wisdom of Egipcians, and he was myyti in his wordis and werkis.
27132	44	7	23	But whanne the tyme of fourti yeer was fillid to hym, it roos vp `in to his herte, that he schulde visite hise britheren, the sones of Israel.
27133	44	7	24	And whanne he say a man suffringe wronge, he vengide hym, and dide veniaunce for hym that suffride the wronge, and he killide the Egipcian.
27134	44	7	25	For he gesside that his britheren schulden vndurstonde, that God schulde yyue to hem helthe bi the hoond of hym; but thei vndurstoden not.
27135	44	7	26	For in the dai suynge he apperide to hem chidinge, and he acordide hem in pees, and seide, Men, ye ben britheren; whi noyen ye ech othere?
27136	44	7	27	But he that dide the wronge to his neiybore, puttide hym awey, and seide, Who ordeynede thee prince and domesman on vs?
27137	44	7	28	Whethir thou wolt sle me, as yistirdai thou killidist the Egipcian?
27138	44	7	29	And in this word Moises flei, and was maad a comeling in the loond of Madian, where he bigat twei sones.
27139	44	7	30	And whanne he hadde fillid fourti yeer, an aungel apperide to hym in fier of flawme of a buysch, in desert of the mount of Syna.
27140	44	7	31	And Moises siy, and wondride on the siyt. And whanne he neiyede to biholde, the vois of the Lord was maad to hym,
27141	44	7	32	and seide, Y am God of youre fadris, God of Abraham, God of Ysaac, God of Jacob. Moises was maad tremblynge, and durste not biholde.
27142	44	7	33	But God seide to hym, Do of the schoon of thi feet, for the place in which thou stondist is hooli erthe.
27143	44	7	34	Y seynge say the turmentyng of my puple that is in Egipt, and Y herde the mornyng of hem, and Y cam doun to delyuere hem. And now come thou, and Y schal sende thee in to Egipt.
27144	44	7	35	This Moises whom thei denyeden, seiynge, Who ordeynede thee prince and domesman on vs? God sente this prince and ayenbiere, with the hoond of the aungel, that apperide to hym in the busch.
27145	44	7	36	This Moises ledde hem out, and dide wondris and signes in the loond of Egipt, and in the reed see, and in desert fourti yeeris.
27146	44	7	37	This is Moises, that seide to the sones of Israel, God schal reise to you a profete of youre bretheren, as me ye schulen here him.
27147	44	7	38	This it is, that was in the chirche in wildirnesse, with the aungel that spak to hym in the mount of Syna, and with oure fadris; which took words of lijf to yyue to vs.
27148	44	7	39	To whom oure fadris wolden not obeie, but puttiden hym awei, and weren turned awei in hertis in to Egipt,
27149	44	7	40	seiynge to Aaron, Make thou to vs goddis, that schulen go bifore vs; for to this Moyses that ledde vs out of the lond of Egipt, we witen not what is don to hym.
27150	44	7	41	And thei maden a calf in tho daies, and offriden a sacrifice to the mawmet; and thei weren glad in the werkis of her hondis.
27151	44	7	42	And God turnede, and bitook hem to serue to the knyythod of heuene, as it is writun in the book of profetis, Whether ye, hous of Israel, offriden to me slayn sacrificis, ether sacrificis, fourti yeris in desert?
27152	44	7	43	And ye han take the tabernacle of Moloc, and the sterre of youre god Renfam, figuris that ye han maad to worschipe hem; and Y schal translate you in to Babiloyn.
27153	44	7	44	The tabernacle of witnessing was with oure fadris in desert, as God disposide to hem, and spak to Moyses, that he schulde make it aftir the fourme that he say.
27154	44	7	45	Which also oure fadris token with Jhesu, and brouyten in to the possessioun of hethene men, whiche God puttide awey fro the face of oure fadris, til in to the daies of Dauid,
27155	44	7	46	that fonde grace anentis God, and axide that he schulde fynde a tabernacle to God of Jacob.
27156	44	7	47	But Salomon bildide the hous `to hym.
27157	44	7	48	But the hiy God dwellith not in thingis maad bi hoond,
27158	44	7	49	as he seith bi the profete, Heuene is a seete to me, and the erthe is the stool of my feet; what hous schulen ye bilde to me, seith the Lord, ether what place is of my restyng?
27159	44	7	50	Whether myn hoond made not alle these thingis?
27160	44	7	51	With hard nol, and vncircumcidid hertis and eris ye withstoden eueremore the Hooli Goost; and as youre fadris, so ye.
27161	44	7	52	Whom of the profetis han not youre fadris pursued, and han slayn hem that bifor telden of the comyng of the riytful man, whos traitouris and mansleeris ye weren now?
27162	44	7	53	Whiche token the lawe in ordynaunce of aungels, and han not kept it.
27163	44	7	54	And thei herden these thingis, and weren dyuersli turmentid in her hertis, and grenneden with teeth on hym.
27164	44	7	55	But whanne Steuene was ful of the Hooli Goost, he bihelde in to heuene, and say the glorie of God, and Jhesu stondinge on the riythalf of the vertu of God. And he seide, Lo! Y se heuenes openyd, and mannus sone stondynge on the riythalf of the vertu of God.
27165	44	7	56	And thei crieden with a greet vois, and stoppiden her eris, and maden with o wille an assauyt in to hym.
27166	44	7	57	And thei brouyten hym out of the citee, and stonyden. And the witnessis diden of her clothis, bisidis the feet of a yong man, that was clepid Saule.
27167	44	7	58	And thei stonyden Steuene, that clepide God to help, seiynge, Lord Jhesu, resseyue my spirit.
27168	44	7	59	And he knelide, and criede with a greet vois, and seide, Lord, sette not to hem this synne. And whanne he hadde seid this thing, he diede.
27169	44	8	1	But Saul was consentynge to his deth.
27170	44	8	1	And greet persecucioun was maad that dai in the chirche, that was in Jerusalem. And alle men weren scatered bi the cuntrees of Judee and Samarie, outakun the apostlis.
27171	44	8	2	But good men birieden Steuene, and maden greet mornyng on hym.
27172	44	8	3	But Saul greetli distruyede the chirche, and entryde bi housis, and drowe men and wymmen, and bitook hem in to prisoun.
27173	44	8	4	And thei that weren scaterid, passiden forth, prechynge the word of God.
27174	44	8	5	And Filip cam doun in to a citee of Samarie, and prechide to hem Crist.
27175	44	8	6	And the puple yaf tent to thes thingis that weren seid of Filip, with o wille herynge and seynge the signes that he dide.
27176	44	8	7	For manye of hem that hadden vnclene spirits, crieden with a greet vois, and wenten out.
27177	44	8	8	And manye sijk in the palsi, and crokid, weren heelid.
27178	44	8	9	Therfor greet ioye was maad in that citee. But there was a man in that citee, whos name was Symount, a witche, that hadde disseyued the folc of Samarie, seiynge, that him silf was sum greet man.
27179	44	8	10	Whom alle herkeneden, fro the leest to the moost, and seiden, This is the vertu of God, which is clepid greet.
27180	44	8	11	And thei leueden hym, for long tyme he hadde maddid hem with his witche craftis.
27181	44	8	12	But whanne thei hadden bileued to Filip, `that prechide of the kingdom of God, men and wymmen weren baptisid in the name of Jhesu Crist.
27182	44	8	13	And thanne also Symount him silf bileued; and whanne he was baptisid, he drouy to Filip; and he sai also that signes and grete vertues weren don, he was astonyed, and wondride.
27183	44	8	14	But whanne the apostlis that weren at Jerusalem, hadden herd that Samarie hadde resseyued the word of God, thei senten to hem Petre and Joon.
27184	44	8	15	And whanne thei camen, thei preieden for hem, that thei schulden resseyue the Hooli Goost;

27189	44	8	20	But Petir seide to hym, Thi money be with thee into perdicioun, for thou gessidist the yifte of God schulde be had for monei.
27190	44	8	21	Ther is no part, ne sort to thee, in this word, for thin herte is not riytful bifor God.
27191	44	8	22	Therfor do thou penaunce for this wickidnesse of thee, and preie God, if perauenture this thouyt of thin herte be foryouun to thee.
27192	44	8	23	For Y se that thou art in the gall of bitternesse and in the boond of wickidnesse.
27193	44	8	24	And Symount answeride, and seide, Preie ye for me to the Lord, that no thing of these thingis that ye han seid, com on me.
27194	44	8	25	And thei witnessiden, and spaken the word of the Lord, and yeden ayen to Jerusalem, and prechiden to many cuntrees of Samaritans.
27195	44	8	26	And an aungel of the Lord spak to Filip, and seide, Ryse thou, and go ayens the south, to the weie that goith doun fro Jerusalem in to Gasa; this is desert.
27196	44	8	27	And he roos, and wente forth. And lo! a man of Ethiopie, a myyti man seruaunt, a yelding of Candace, the queen of Ethiopiens, which was on alle her richessis, cam to worschipe in Jerusalem.
27197	44	8	28	And he turnede ayen, sittinge on his chare, and redinge Isaie, the profete.
27198	44	8	29	And the spirit seide to Filip, Neiye thou, and ioyne thee to this chare.
27199	44	8	30	And Filip `ran to, and herde hym redynge Ysaie, the prophete. And he seide, Gessist thou, whether thou vndirstondist, what thingis thou redist?
27200	44	8	31	And he seide, How may Y, if no man schewe to me? And he preiede Filip, that he schulde come vp, and sitte with hym.
27201	44	8	32	And the place of the scripture that he redde, was this, As a scheep he was led to sleyng, and as a lomb bifor a man that scherith him is doumb with out vois, so he openyde not his mouth.
27202	44	8	33	In mekenesse his dom was takun vp; who schal telle out the generacioun of hym? For his lijf schal be takun awei fro the erthe.
27203	44	8	34	And the gelding answeride to Filip, and seide, Y biseche thee, of `what profete seith he this thing? of him silf, ethir of ony othere?
27204	44	8	35	And Filip openyde his mouth, and bigan at this scripture, and prechide to him Jhesu.
27205	44	8	36	And the while thei wenten bi the weie, thei camen to a water. And the gelding seide, Lo! watir; who forbedith me to be baptisid?
27206	44	8	37	And Filip seide, If thou bileuest of al the herte, it is leueful. And he answeride, and seide, Y bileue that Jhesu Crist is the sone of God.
27207	44	8	38	And he comaundide the chare to stonde stille. And thei wenten doun bothe into the watir, Filip and the gelding, and Filip baptiside hym.
27208	44	8	39	And whanne thei weren come vp of the watir, the spirit of the Lord rauyschide Filip, and the gelding say hym no more.
27209	44	8	40	And Filip was foundun in Azotus; and he passide forth, and prechide to alle citees, til he cam to Cesarie.
27210	44	9	1	But Saul, yit a blower of manassis and of betingis ayens the disciplis of the Lord,

27213	44	9	4	and he fallide to the erthe, and herde a vois seiynge to hym, Saul, Saul, what pursuest thou me?
27214	44	9	5	And he seide, Who art thou, Lord? And he seide, Y am Jhesu of Nazareth, whom thou pursuest. It is hard to thee, to kike ayens the pricke.
27215	44	9	6	And he tremblide, and wondride, and seide, Lord, what wolt thou that Y do?
27216	44	9	7	And the Lord seide to hym, Rise vp, and entre in to the citee, and it schal be seide to thee, what it bihoueth thee to do. And tho men that wenten with hym, stoden astonyed; for thei herden a vois, but thei sien no man.
27217	44	9	8	And Saul roos fro the earth; and whanne hise iyen weren opened, he say no thing. And thei drowen hym bi the hondis, and ledden hym in to Damask.
27218	44	9	9	And he was thre daies not seynge; `and he eete not, nether drank.
27219	44	9	10	And a disciple, Ananye bi name, was at Damask. And the Lord seide to hym in `a visioun, Ananye. And he seide, Lo!

27222	44	9	13	And Ananye answerde, Lord, Y haue herd of many of this man, how greete yuelis he dide to thi seyntis in Jerusalem;
27223	44	9	14	and this hath power of the princis of preestis, to bynde alle men that clepen thi name to helpe.
27224	44	9	15	And the Lord seide to hym, Go thou, for this is to me a vessel of chesing, that he bere my name bifore hethene men, and kingis, and tofore the sones of Israel.
27225	44	9	16	For Y schal schewe to hym, how grete thingis it bihoueth hym to suffre for my name.
27226	44	9	17	And Ananye wente, and entride in to the hous; and leide on hym his hondis, and seide, Saul brothir, the Lord Jhesu sente me, that apperide to thee in the weie, in which thou camest, that thou se, and be fulfillid with the Hooli Goost.
27227	44	9	18	And anoon as the scalis felden fro hise iyen, he resseyuede siyt. And he roos, and was baptisid.
27228	44	9	19	And whanne he hadde takun mete, he was coumfortid. And he was bi sum daies with the disciplis, that weren at Damask.
27229	44	9	20	And anoon he entride in to the synagogis, and prechide the Lord Jhesu, for this is the sone of God.

27231	44	9	22	But Saul myche more wexede strong, and confoundide the Jewis that dwelliden at Damask, and affermyde that this is Crist.
27232	44	9	23	And whanne manye daies weren fillid, Jewis maden a counsel, that thei schulden sle hym.
27233	44	9	24	And the aspies of hem weren maad knowun to Saul. And thei kepten the yatis dai and niyt, that thei schulden sle him.

27235	44	9	26	And whanne he cam in to Jerusalem, he assaiede to ioyne hym to the disciplis; and alle dredden hym, and leueden not that he was a disciple.
27236	44	9	27	But Barnabas took, and ledde hym to the apostlis, and telde to hem, how in the weie he hadde seyn the Lord, and that he spak to hym, and hou in Damask he dide tristili in the name of Jhesu.
27237	44	9	28	And he was with hem, and entride, and yede out in Jerusalem, and dide tristili in the name of Jhesu.

27296	44	10	44	And yit while that Petre spak these wordis, the Hooli Goost felde on alle that herden the word.
27297	44	10	45	And the feithful men of circumcisioun, that camen with Petre, wondriden, that also in to naciouns the grace of the Hooli Goost is sched out.
27298	44	10	46	For thei herden hem spekynge in langagis, and magnyfiynge God.

27315	44	11	15	And whanne Y hadde bigunnun to speke, the Hooli Goost felle on hem, as in to vs in the bigynnyng.
27316	44	11	16	And Y bithouyte on the word of the Lord, as he seide, For Joon baptiside in watir, but ye schulen be baptisid in the Hooli Goost.
27317	44	11	17	Therfor if God yaf to hem the same grace, as to vs that bileueden in the Lord Jhesu Crist, who was Y, that myyte forbeede the Lord, that he yyue not the Hooli Goost to hem that bileueden in the name of Jhesu Crist?
27318	44	11	18	Whanne these thingis weren herd, thei helden pees, and glorifieden God, and seiden, Therfor also to hethene men God hath youun penaunce to lijf.
27319	44	11	19	And thei that weren scaterid of the tribulacioun that was maad vndir Steuene, walkiden forth to Fenyce, and to Cipre, and to Antioche, and spaken the word to no man, but to Jewis aloone.

27338	44	12	8	And the aungel seide to hym, Girde thee, and do on thin hoosis. And he dide so. And he seide to hym, Do aboute thee thi clothis, and sue me.
27339	44	12	9	And he yede out, and suede hym; and he wiste not that it was soth, that was don bi the aungel; for he gesside hym silf to haue sey a visioun.
27340	44	12	10	And thei passiden the first and the secounde warde, and camen to the iren yate that ledith to the citee, which anoon was opened to hem. And thei yeden out, and camen in to o street, and anoon the aungel passide awei fro hym.

27342	44	12	12	And he bihelde, and cam to the hous of Marie, modir of Joon, that is named Marcus, where many weren gaderid togidre, and preiynge.
27343	44	12	13	And whanne he knockid at the dore of the yate, a damysel, Rode bi name, cam forth to se.

27346	44	12	16	But Petre abood stille, and knockide. And whanne thei hadden opened the dore, thei sayen hym, and wondriden.
27347	44	12	17	And he bekenyde to hem with his hoond to be stille, and telde hou the Lord hadde led hym out of the prisoun. And he seide, Telle ye to James and to the britheren these thingis. And he yede out, and wente in to an othere place.
27348	44	12	18	And whanne the dai was come, ther was not lytil troubling among the knyytis, what was don of Petre.

27352	44	12	22	And the puple criede, The voicis of God, and not of man.
27353	44	12	23	And anoon an aungel of the Lord smoot hym, for he hadde not youun onour to God; and he was wastid of wormes, and diede.
27354	44	12	24	And the word of the Lord waxide, and was multiplied.
27355	44	12	25	And Barnabas and Saul turneden ayen fro Jerusalem, whanne the mynystrie was fillid, and token Joon, that was named Marcus.
27356	44	13	1	And profetis and doctouris weren in the chirche that was at Antioche, in which Barnabas, and Symount, that was clepid Blac, and Lucius Cironense, and Manaen, that was the soukynge fere of Eroude tetrarke, and Saul weren.
27357	44	13	2	And whanne thei mynystriden to the Lord, and fastiden, the Hooli Goost seide to hem, Departe ye to me Saul and Barnabas, in to the werk to which Y haue takun hem.
27358	44	13	3	Thanne thei fastiden, and preieden, and leiden hondis on hem, and leten hem go.
27359	44	13	4	But thei weren sent of the Hooli Goost, and wenten forth to Seleucia, and fro thennus thei wenten bi boot to Cipre.
27360	44	13	5	And whanne thei camen to Salamyne, thei prechiden the word of God in the synagogis of Jewis; and thei hadden also Joon in mynystrie.
27361	44	13	6	And whanne thei hadden walkid bi al the ile to Pafum, thei founden a man, a witche, a false profete, a Jewe, to whom the name was Bariesu,

27364	44	13	9	But Saul, which is seid also Paul, was fillid with the Hooli Goost, and bihelde in to hym, and seide, A!
27365	44	13	10	thou ful of al gile, and al falsnesse, thou sone of the deuel, thou enemye of al riytwisnesse, thou leeuest not to turne vpsodoun the riytful weies of the Lord.
27366	44	13	11	And now lo! the hoond of the Lord is on thee, and thou schalt be blynde, and not seynge the sunne in to a tyme. And anoon myste and derknesse felden doun on hym; and he yede aboute, and souyte hym that schulde yyue hoond to hym.
27367	44	13	12	Thanne the proconsul, whanne he hadde seyn the dede, bileuede, wondringe on the techyng of the Lord.
27368	44	13	13	And whanne fro Pafum Poul hadde go bi a boot, and thei that weren with hym, thei camen to Pergen of Pamfilie; but Joon departide fro hem, and turnede ayen to Jerusalem.
27369	44	13	14	And thei yeden to Pergen, and camen to Antioche of Persidie; and thei entriden in to the synagoge in the dai of sabatis, and saten.
27370	44	13	15	And after the redyng of the lawe and of the prophetis, the princis of the synagoge senten to hem, and seiden, Britheren, if ony word of exortacioun to the puple is in you, seie ye.
27371	44	13	16	And Poul roos, and with hoond baad silence, and seide, Men of Israel, and ye that dreden God, here ye.
27372	44	13	17	God of the puple of Israel chees oure fadris, and enhaunside the puple, whanne thei weren comelingis in the loond of Egipt, and in an hiy arme he ledde hem out of it;
27373	44	13	18	and bi the tyme of fourti yeeris he suffride her maneres in desert.
27374	44	13	19	And he destriede seuene folkis in the loond of Canaan, and bi sort departide to hem her lond,
27375	44	13	20	as aftir foure hundrid and fifti yeeris. And aftir these thingis he yaf domesmen, to Samuel, the profete.
27376	44	13	21	And fro that tyme thei axiden a kyng, and God yaf to hem Saul, the sone of Cis, a man of the lynage of Beniamyn, bi fourti yeeris.
27377	44	13	22	And whanne he was don awei, he reiside to hem Dauid king, to whom he bar witnessing, and seide, Y haue foundun Dauid, the sone of Jesse, a man aftir myn herte, which schal do alle my willis.
27378	44	13	23	Of whos seed bi the biheest God hath led out to Israel a sauyoure Jhesu,
27379	44	13	24	whanne Joon prechide bifor the face of his comyng the baptym of penaunce to al the puple of Israel.
27380	44	13	25	But whanne Joon fillide his cours, he seide, Y am not he, whom ye demen me to be; but lo! he cometh aftir me, and Y am not worthi to doon of the schoon of hise feet.
27381	44	13	26	Britheren, and sones of the kynde of Abraham, and whiche that in you dreden God, to you the word of helthe is sent.
27382	44	13	27	For thei that dwelliden at Jerusalem, and princis of it, that knewen not this Jhesu, and the voicis of prophetis, that by euery sabat ben red, demyden, and filliden;
27383	44	13	28	and thei founden in hym no cause of deth, and axiden of Pilat, that thei schulden sle hym.
27384	44	13	29	And whanne thei hadden endid alle thingis that weren writun of hym, thei token hym doun of the tre, and leiden hym in a graue.
27385	44	13	30	And God reiside hym fro deth in the thridde dai; which was seyn bi mony daies to
27386	44	13	31	hem that wenten vp togidere with hym fro Galilee in to Jerusalem, which ben til now his witnessis to the puple.
27387	44	13	32	And we schewen to you the biheest that was maad to oure fadris;
27388	44	13	33	for God hath fulfillid this to her sones, and ayenreisid Jhesu; as in the secounde salm it is writun, Thou art my sone, to dai Y bigat thee.
27389	44	13	34	And he ayenreiside hym fro deth, that he schulde not turne ayen in to corrupcioun, seide thus, For Y schal yyue to you the hooli trewe thingis of Dauid.
27390	44	13	35	And therfor and on an othere stide he seith, Thou schalt not yyue thin hooli to se corrupcioun.
27391	44	13	36	But Dauid in his generacioun, whanne he hadde mynstrid to the wille of God, diede, and was leid with hise fadris, and say corrupcioun;
27392	44	13	37	but he whom God reiside fro deth, say not corrupcioun.
27393	44	13	38	Therfor, britheren, be it knowun to you, that bi hym remyssioun of synnes is teld to you, fro alle synnes, of whiche ye myyten not be iustified in the lawe of Moises.
27394	44	13	39	In this ech man that bileueth, is iustified.
27395	44	13	40	Therfor se ye, that it come not to you, that is biforeseid in the profetis,
27396	44	13	41	Ye dispiseris, se ye, and wondre ye, and be ye scaterid abrood; for Y worche a werk in youre daies, a werk that ye schulen not bileue, if ony man schal telle it to you.
27397	44	13	42	And whanne thei yeden out, thei preieden, that in the sabat suynge thei schulden speke to hem these wordis.
27398	44	13	43	And whanne the synagoge was left, manye of Jewis and of comelingis worschypynge God supeden Poul and Barnabas; that spaken, and counseliden hem, that thei schulden dwelle in the grace of God.
27399	44	13	44	And in the sabat suynge almest al the citee cam togidir, to here the word of God.
27400	44	13	45	And Jewis sien the puple, and weren fillid with enuye, and ayenseiden these thingis that weren seyd of Poul, and blasfemyden.
27401	44	13	46	Thanne Poul and Barnabas stidfastli seiden, To you it bihofte first to speke the word of God; but for ye putten it awei, and han demyd you vnworthi to euerlastinge lijf, lo! we turnen to hethen men.
27402	44	13	47	For so the Lord comaundide vs, Y haue set thee in to liyt to hethen men, that thou be in to helthe to the vtmest of erthe.
27403	44	13	48	And hethen men herden, `and ioieden, and glorifieden the word of the Lord; and bileueden, as manye as weren bifore ordeyned to euerlastinge lijf.
27404	44	13	49	And the word of the Lord was sowun bi al the cuntre.
27405	44	13	50	But the Jewis stiriden religiouse wymmen, and onest, and the worthiest men of the citee, and stireden persecucioun ayens Poul and Barnabas, and dryuen hem out of her cuntreis.
27406	44	13	51	And thei schoken awei in to hem the duste of her feet, and camen to Yconye.
27407	44	13	52	And the disciplis weren fillid with ioye and the Hooli Goost.
27408	44	14	1	But it bifelde at Yconye, that thei entriden togidir in to the synagoge of Jewis, and spaken, so that ful greet multitude of Jewis and Grekis bileueden.
27409	44	14	2	But the Jewis that weren vnbileueful, reiseden persecucioun, and stiriden to wraththe the soulis of hethene men ayens the britheren; but the Lord yaf soone pees.
27410	44	14	3	Therfor thei dwelliden myche tyme, and diden tristili in the Lord, berynge witnessyng to the word of his grace, yyuynge signes and wondris to be maad bi the hondis of hem.
27411	44	14	4	But the multitude of the citee was departid, and sum weren with the Jewis, and sum with the apostlis.
27412	44	14	5	But whanne ther was maad `an asaute of the hethene men and the Jewis, with her princis, to turmenten and to stonen hem,
27413	44	14	6	thei vndurstoden, and fledden togidere to the citees of Licaonye, and Listris, and Derben, and into al the cuntre aboute. And thei prechiden there the gospel, and al the multitude was moued togider in the teching of hem. Poul and Barnabas dwelten at Listris.
27414	44	14	7	And a man at Listris was sijk in the feet, and hadde sete crokid fro his modris wombe, which neuer hadde goen.
27415	44	14	8	This herde Poul spekinge; and Poul biheld hym, and siy that he hadde feith, that he schulde be maad saaf,
27416	44	14	9	and seide with a greet vois, Rise thou `vp riyt on thi feet. And he lippide, and walkide.
27417	44	14	10	And the puple, whanne thei hadde seyn that that Poul dide, reriden her vois in Licaon tunge, and seiden, Goddis maad lijk to men ben comun doun to vs.
27418	44	14	11	And thei clepiden Barnabas Jubiter, and Poul Mercurie, for he was ledere of the word.
27419	44	14	12	And the preest of Jubiter that was bifor the citee, brouyte boolis and crownes bifor the yatis, with puplis, and wolde haue maad sacrifice.
27420	44	14	13	And whanne the apostlis Barnabas and Poul herden this, thei to-renten her cootis; and thei skipten out among the puple,

27424	44	14	17	And thei seiynge these thingis, vnnethis swagiden the puple, that thei offriden not to hem.
27425	44	14	18	But sum Jewis camen ouer fro Antioche and Iconye, and counseilden the puple, and stonyden Poul, and drowen out of the citee, and gessiden that he was deed.
27426	44	14	19	But whanne disciplis weren comun aboute him, he roos, and wente in to the citee; and in the dai suynge he wente forth with Barnabas in to Derben.
27427	44	14	20	And whanne thei hadden prechid to the ilk citee, and tauyte manye, thei turneden ayen to Listris, and Iconye, and to Antioche; confermynge the soulis of disciplis,
27428	44	14	21	and monestinge, that thei schulden dwelle in feith, and seiden, That bi many tribulaciouns it bihoueth vs to entre in to the kingdom of heuenes.
27429	44	14	22	And whanne thei hadden ordeined prestis to hem bi alle citees, and hadden preied with fastyngis, thei bitoken hem to the Lord, in whom thei bileueden.
27430	44	14	23	And thei passiden Persidie, and camen to Pamfilie;
27431	44	14	24	and thei spaken the word `of the Lord in Pergen, and camen doun in to Italie.
27432	44	14	25	And fro thennys thei wenten bi boot to Antiochie, fro whennus thei weren takun to the grace of God, in to the werk that thei filliden.

27434	44	14	27	And thei dwelliden not a litil tyme with the disciplis.
27435	44	15	1	And summe camen doun fro Judee, and tauyten britheren, That but ye ben circumcidid after the lawe of Moises, ye moun not be maad saaf.
27436	44	15	2	Therfor whanne ther was maad not a litil discencioun to Poul and Barnabas ayens hem, thei ordeyneden, that Poul and Barnabas, and summe othere of hem, schulden go vp to the apostlis and preestis in Jerusalem, on this questioun.

27438	44	15	4	And whanne thei camen to Jerusalem, thei weren resseyued of the chirche and of the apostlis, and of the eldre men, and telden, hou greet thingis God dide with hem.

27443	44	15	9	and no thing diuerside bitwixe vs and hem, `and clenside the hertis of hem bi feith.
27444	44	15	10	Now thanne what tempten ye God, to putte a yok on the necke of the disciplis, which nether we, nether oure fadris miyten bere?
27445	44	15	11	But bi the grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist we bileuen to be saued, as also thei.
27446	44	15	12	And al the multitude helde pees, and herden Barnaban and Poul, tellinge hou grete signes and wondris God dide bi hem in hethene men.
27447	44	15	13	And aftir that thei helden pees, James answeride, and seide, Britheren, here ye me.
27448	44	15	14	Symount telde, hou God visitide, first to take of hethene men a puple to his name.
27449	44	15	15	And the wordis of prophetis acorden to him,
27450	44	15	16	as it is writun, Aftir this Y schal turne ayen, and bilde the tabernacle of Dauid, that felle doun; and Y schal bilde ayen the cast doun thingis of it, and Y schal reise it;

27452	44	15	18	Fro the world, the werk of the Lord is knowun to the Lord.
27453	44	15	19	For which thing Y deme hem that of hethene men ben conuertid to God,
27454	44	15	20	to be not disesid, but to write to hem, that thei absteyne hem fro defoulingis of maumetis, and fro fornicacioun, and stranglid thingis, and blood.
27455	44	15	21	For Moyses of elde tymes hath in alle citees hem that prechen him in synagogis, where bi ech sabat he is red.
27456	44	15	22	Thanne it pleside to the apostlis, and to the eldre men, with al the chirche, to chees men of hem, and sende to Antioche, with Poul and Barnabas, Judas, that was named Barsabas, and Silas, the firste men among britheren;
27457	44	15	23	and wroten bi the hondis of hem, Apostlis and eldre britheren to hem that ben at Antioche, and Sirie, and Silice, britheren of hethen men, greting.

27460	44	15	26	men that yauen her lyues for the name of oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
27461	44	15	27	Therfor we senten Judas and Silas, and thei schulen telle the same thingis to you bi wordis.
27462	44	15	28	For it is seyn to the Hooly Goost and to vs, to putte to you no thing more of charge, than these nedeful thingis,
27463	44	15	29	that ye absteyne you fro the offrid thingis of maumetis, and blood stranglid, and fornicacioun. Fro whiche ye kepinge you, schulen do wel. Fare ye wel.
27464	44	15	30	Therfor thei weren let go, and camen doun to Antioche; and whanne the multitude was gaderid, thei token the epistle;
27465	44	15	31	which whanne thei hadden red, thei ioyden on the coumfort.
27466	44	15	32	And Judas and Silas and thei, for thei weren prophetis, coumfortiden britheren, and confermyden with ful many wordis.
27467	44	15	33	But aftir that thei hadden be there a lytil while, thei weren let go of britheren with pees, to hem that hadden sent hem.
27468	44	15	34	But it was seyn to Silas, to dwelle there; and Judas wente aloone to Jerusalem.
27469	44	15	35	And Poul and Barnabas dwelten at Antioche, techinge and prechinge the word of the Lord, with othere manye.
27470	44	15	36	But after summe daies, Poul seide to Barnabas, Turne we ayen, and visite britheren bi alle citees, in whiche we han prechid the word of the Lord, hou thei han hem.
27471	44	15	37	And Barnabas wolde take with hym Joon, that was named Marcus.
27472	44	15	38	But Poul preiede him, that he that departide fro hem fro Pamfilie, and wente not with hem in to the werk, schulde not be resseyued.
27473	44	15	39	And dissencioun was maad, so that thei departiden a twynny. And Barnabas took Mark, and cam bi boot to Cipre.
27474	44	15	40	And Poul chees Silas, and wente forth fro the britheren, and was bitakun to the grace of God.
27475	44	15	41	And he wente bi Sirie and Silice, and confermyde the chirche, comaundinge to kepe the heestis of apostlis and eldre men.
27476	44	16	1	And he cam in to Derben and Listram. And lo! a disciple was there, bi name Timothe, the sone of a Jewesse cristen, and of the fadir hethen.
27477	44	16	2	And britheren that weren in Listris and Iconye, yeldiden good witnessing to hym.
27478	44	16	3	And Poul wolde that this man schulde go forth with him, and he took, and circumsidide hym, for Jewis that weren in the places. For alle wisten, that his fadir was hethen.
27479	44	16	4	Whanne thei passiden bi citees, thei bitoken to hem to kepe the techingis, that weren demyd of apostlis and eldre men, that weren at Jerusalem.
27480	44	16	5	And the chirches weren confermed in feith, and encreseden in noumbre eche dai.
27481	44	16	6	And thei passiden Frigie, and the cuntre of Galathi, and weren forbedun of the Hooli Goost to speke the word of God in Asie.
27482	44	16	7	And whanne thei camen in to Mysie, thei assaieden to go in to Bithynye, and the spirit of Jhesu suffride not hem.
27483	44	16	8	But whanne thei hadden passid bi Mysie, thei camen doun to Troade;
27484	44	16	9	and a visioun `bi nyyt was schewid to Poul. But a man of Macedonye that stoode, preiede hym, and seide, Go thou in to Macedonye, and helpe vs.
27485	44	16	10	And as he hadde sei the visioun, anoon we souyten to go forth in to Macedonye, and weren maad certeyn, that God hadde clepid vs to preche to hem.
27486	44	16	11	And we yeden bi schip fro Troade, and camen to Samatrachia with streiyt cours; and the dai suynge to Neapolis;
27487	44	16	12	and fro thennus to Filippis, that is the firste part of Macedonye, the citee colonye. And we weren in this citee summe daies, and spaken togidere.
27488	44	16	13	And in the dai of sabotis we wenten forth with out the yate bisidis the flood, where preier semyde to be; and we saten, and spaken to wymmen that camen togidere.
27489	44	16	14	And a womman, Lidda bi name, a purpuresse of the cite of Tiatirens, worschipinge God, herde; whos herte the Lord openyde to yyue tente to these thingis, that weren seid of Poul.
27490	44	16	15	And whanne sche was baptisid and hir hous, sche preyede, and seide, If ye han demyd that Y am feithful to the Lord, entre ye in to myn hous, and dwelle.
27491	44	16	16	And sche constreynede vs. And it was don, whanne we yeden to preier, that a damysel that hadde a spirit of diuynacioun, mette vs, which yaf greet wynnyng to her lordis in dyuynynge.
27492	44	16	17	This suede Poul and vs, and criede, and seide, These men ben seruauntis of the hiy God, that tellen to you the weie of helthe.
27493	44	16	18	And this sche dide in many daies. And Poul sorewide, and turnede, and seide to the spirit, Y comaunde thee in the name of Jhesu Crist, that thou go out of hir.
27494	44	16	19	And he wente out in the same our. And the lordis of hir siyen, that the hope of her wynnyng wente awei, and thei token Poul and Silas, and ledden in to the `dom place, to the princis.
27495	44	16	20	And thei brouyten hem to the magistratis, and seiden, These men disturblen oure citee,
27496	44	16	21	for thei ben Jewis, and schewen a custom, which it is not leueful to vs to resseyue, nether do, sithen we ben Romayns.
27497	44	16	22	And the puple `and magistratis runnen ayens hem, and when thei hadden to-rente the cootis of hem, thei comaundiden hem to be betun with yerdis.
27498	44	16	23	And whanne thei hadden youun to hem many woundis, thei senten hem into prisoun, and comaundiden to the kepere, that he schulde kepe hem diligentli.
27499	44	16	24	And whanne he hadde take siche a precept, he putte hem into the ynnere prisoun, and streynede the feet of hem in a tre.
27500	44	16	25	And at mydniyt Poul and Silas worschipide, and heriden God; and thei that weren in kepyng herden hem.
27501	44	16	26	And sudenli a greet erthe mouyng was maad, so that the foundementis of the prisoun weren moued. And anoon alle the doris weren openyd, and the boondis of alle weren lousid.
27502	44	16	27	And the kepere of the prisoun was awakid, and siy the yatis `of the prisoun openyd, and with a swerd drawun out he wolde haue slawe hym silf, and gesside that the men that weren boundun, hadden fled.
27503	44	16	28	But Poul criede with a greet vois, and seide, Do thou noon harm to thi silf, for alle we ben here.
27504	44	16	29	And he axide liyt, and entride, and tremblide, and felle doun to Poul and to Silas at her feet.
27505	44	16	30	And he brouyte hem with out forth, and seide, Lordis, what bihoueth me to do, that Y be maad saaf?
27506	44	16	31	And thei seiden, Bileue thou in the Lord Jhesu, and thou schalt be saaf, and thin hous.
27507	44	16	32	And thei spaken to hym the word of the Lord, with alle that weren in his hous.
27508	44	16	33	And he took hem in the ilke our of the niyt, and waschide her woundis. And he was baptisid, and al his hous anoon.
27509	44	16	34	And whanne he hadde led hem in to his hous, he settide to hem a boord. And he was glad with al his hous, and bileuede to God.
27510	44	16	35	And whanne dai was come, the magistratis senten catchepollis, and seiden, Delyuere thou tho men.
27511	44	16	36	And the kepere of the prisoun telde these wordis to Poul, That the magistratis han sent, that ye be delyuered; now therfor go ye out, and go ye in pees.
27512	44	16	37	And Poul seide to hem, Thei senten vs men of Rome in to prisoun, that weren betun openli and vndampned, and now priueli thei bringen vs out; not so, but come thei hem silf, and delyuere vs out.
27513	44	16	38	And the catchepollis telden these wordis to the magistratis; and thei dredden, for thei herden that thei weren Romayns.
27514	44	16	39	And thei camen, and bisechiden hem, and thei brouyten hem out, and preieden, that thei schulden go out of the citee.
27515	44	16	40	And thei yeden out of the prisoun, and entriden to Lidie. And whanne thei siyen britheren, thei coumfortiden hem, and yeden forth.
27516	44	17	1	And whanne thei hadden passid bi Amfipolis and Appollonye, thei camen to Thessolonyk, where was a synagoge of Jewis.
27517	44	17	2	And bi custom Poul entride to hem, and bi thre sabatis he declaride to hem of scripturis,
27518	44	17	3	and openyde, and schewide that it bihofte Crist to suffre, and rise ayen fro deth, and that this is Jhesus Crist, whom Y telle to you.
27519	44	17	4	And summe of hem bileueden, and weren ioyned to Poul and to Silas; and a greet multitude of hethene men worschipide God, and noble wymmen not a fewe.
27520	44	17	5	But the Jewis hadden enuye, and token of the comyn puple summe yuele men, and whanne thei hadden maad a cumpenye, thei moueden the citee. And thei camen to Jasouns hous, and souyten hem to brynge forth among the puple.
27521	44	17	6	And whanne thei founden hem not, thei drowen Jasoun and summe britheren to the princis of the citee, and crieden, That these it ben, that mouen the world, and hidir thei camen,
27522	44	17	7	whiche Jason resseyuede. And these alle don ayens the maundementis of the emperour, and seien, that Jhesu is anothir king.
27523	44	17	8	And thei moueden the puple, and the princis of the citee, herynge these thingis.
27524	44	17	9	And whanne satisfaccioun was takun of Jason, and of othere, thei leten Poul and Silas go.
27525	44	17	10	And anoon bi niyt britheren leten Silas go in to Beroan. And whanne thei camen thidur, thei entriden in to the synagoge of the Jewis.
27526	44	17	11	But these weren the worthier of hem that ben at Thessolonik, whiche resseyueden the word with al desire, eche dai sekinge scripturis, if these thingis hadden hem so.
27527	44	17	12	And manye of hem bileueden and of hethen wymmen onest and men not a fewe.
27528	44	17	13	But whanne the Jewis in Tessalonyk hadden knowe, that also at Bero the word of God was prechid of Poul, thei camen thidir, mouynge and disturblynge the multitude.
27529	44	17	14	And tho anoon britheren delyuerden Poul, that he schulde go to the see; but Sylas and Tymothe dwelten there.
27530	44	17	15	And thei that ledden forth Poul, ledden hym to Atenes. And whanne thei hadden take maundement of him to Silas and to Tymothe, that ful hiyyngli thei schulden come to hym, thei wenten forth.
27531	44	17	16	And while Poul abood hem at Atenys, his spirit was moued in him, for he saiy the citee youun to ydolatrie.
27532	44	17	17	Therfor he disputide in the synagoge with the Jewis, and with men that worschipiden God, and in the dom place, by alle daies to hem that herden.
27533	44	17	18	And summe Epeicureis, and Stoisens, and filosofris disputiden with hym. And summe seiden, What wole this sowere of wordis seie? And othere seiden, He semeth to be a tellere of newe fendis; for he telde to hem Jhesu, and the ayenrisyng.
27534	44	17	19	And thei token, and ledden hym to Ariopage, and seide, Moun we wite, what is this newe doctryne, that is seid of thee?
27535	44	17	20	For thou bringist ynne summe newe thingis to oure eeris; therfor we wolen wite, what these thingis wolen be.
27536	44	17	21	For alle men of Athenys and comlingis herborid yauen tent to noon other thing, but ether to seie, ethir to here, sum newe thing.
27537	44	17	22	And Poul stood in the myddil of Ariopage, and seide, Men of Athenys, bi alle thingis Y se you as veyn worschipers.
27538	44	17	23	For Y passide, and siy youre maumetis, and foond an auter, in which was writun, To the vnknowun God. Therfor which thing ye vnknowynge worschipen, this thing Y schew to you.
27539	44	17	24	God that made the world and alle thingis that ben in it, this, for he is Lord of heuene and of erthe, dwellith not in templis maad with hoond,
27540	44	17	25	nethir is worschipid bi mannus hoondis, nether hath nede of ony thing, for he yyueth lijf to alle men, and brethinge, and alle thingis;
27541	44	17	26	and made of oon al the kinde of men to enhabite on al the face of the erthe, determynynge tymes ordeyned, and termes of the dwellynge of hem,
27542	44	17	27	to seke God, if perauenture thei felen hym, ether fynden, thouy he be not fer fro eche of you.
27543	44	17	28	For in hym we lyuen, and mouen, and ben. As also summe of youre poetis seiden, And we ben also the kynde of hym.
27544	44	17	29	Therfor sithen we ben the kynde of God, we schulen not deme, that godli thing is lijk gold, and siluer, ethir stoon, ethir to grauyng of craft and thouyt of man.
27545	44	17	30	For God dispisith the tymes of this vnkunnyng, and now schewith to men, that alle euery where doon penaunce; for that he hath ordeyned a dai,
27546	44	17	31	in which he schal deme the world in equite, in a man in which he ordeynede, and yaf feith to alle men, and reiside hym fro deth.
27547	44	17	32	And whanne thei hadden herd the ayenrysing of deed men, summe scorneden, and summe seiden, We schulen here thee eft of this thing.
27548	44	17	33	So Poul wente out of the myddil of hem.
27549	44	17	34	But summen drowen to hym, and bileueden. Among whiche Dynyse Aropagite was, and a womman, bi name Damaris, and othere men with hem.
27550	44	18	1	Aftir these thingis Poul yede out of Atenes, and cam to Corinthie.
27551	44	18	2	And he fonde a man, a Jewe, Aquila bi name, of Ponte bi kynde, that late cam from Ytalie, and Priscille, his wijf, for that Claudius comaundide alle Jewis to departe fro Rome; and he cam to hem.
27552	44	18	3	And for he was of the same craft, he dwellide with hem, and wrouyte; and thei weren of roopmakeris craft.
27553	44	18	4	And he disputide in the synagoge bi ech sabat, puttynge among the name of the Lord Jhesu; and he counselide Jewis and Grekis.
27554	44	18	5	And whanne Silas and Tymothe camen fro Macedonye, Poul yaf bisynesse to the word, and witnesside to the Jewis, that Jhesu is Crist.
27555	44	18	6	But whanne thei ayenseiden and blasfemyden, he schoke awei hise clothis, and seide to hem, Youre blood be on youre heed; Y schal be clene from hennus forth, and schal go to hethene men.
27556	44	18	7	And he passide fro thennus, and entride in to the hous of a iust man, Tite bi name, that worschipide God, whos hous was ioyned to the synagoge.
27557	44	18	8	And Crispe, prince of the synagoge, bileuede to the Lord, with al his hous. And many of the Corinthies herden, and bileueden, and weren cristened.
27558	44	18	9	And the Lord seide bi nyyt to Poul bi a visioun, Nyle thou drede, but speke, and be not stille;
27559	44	18	10	for Y am with thee, and no man schal be put to thee to noye thee, for myche puple is to me in this citee.
27560	44	18	11	And he dwellide there a yeer and sixe monethis, techinge among hem the word of God.
27561	44	18	12	But whanne Gallion was proconsul of Acaye, Jewis risen vp with oo wille ayens Poul, and ledden hym to the doom,
27562	44	18	13	and seiden, Ayens the lawe this counselith men to worschipe God.
27563	44	18	14	And whanne Poul bigan to opene his mouth, Gallion seide to the Jewis, If there were ony wickid thing, ether yuel trespas, ye Jewis, riytli Y schulde suffre you;
27564	44	18	15	but if questiouns ben of the word, and of names of youre lawe, bisee you silf; Y wole not be domesman of these thingis.
27565	44	18	16	And he droof hem fro the doom place.
27566	44	18	17	And alle token Sostenes, prince of the synagoge, and smoten him bifor the doom place; and no thing of these was to charge to Gallion.
27567	44	18	18	And whanne Poul hadde abidun many daies, he seide fare wel to britheren, and bi boot cam to Syrie. And Priscille and Aquila camen with hym, whiche hadden clippid his heed in Tencris; for he had a vow.
27568	44	18	19	And he cam to Effesie, and there he lefte hem; and he yede in to the synagoge, and disputide with Jewis.
27569	44	18	20	And whanne thei preieden, that he schulde dwelle more time,
27570	44	18	21	he consentide not, but he made `fare wel, and seide, Eft Y schal turne ayen to you, if God wole; and he wente forth fro Effesi.
27571	44	18	22	And he cam doun to Cesarie, and he yede vp, and grette the chirche, and cam doun to Antiochie.
27572	44	18	23	And whanne he hadde dwellide there sumwhat of time, he wente forth, walkinge bi rewe thorou the cuntrei of Galathie, and Frigie, and confermyde alle the disciplis.
27573	44	18	24	But a Jewe, Apollo bi name, a man of Alisaundre of kinde, a man eloquent, cam to Effesie; and he was myyti in scripturis.
27574	44	18	25	This man was tauyt the weie of the Lord, and was feruent in spirit, and spak, and tauyte diligentli tho thingis that weren of Jhesu, and knew oonli the baptym of Joon.
27575	44	18	26	And this man bigan to do tristili in the synagoge. Whom whanne Priscille and Aquila herden, thei token hym, and more diligentli expowneden to hym the weie of the Lord.
27576	44	18	27	And whanne he wolde go to Acaie, britheren excitiden, and wroten to the disciplis, that thei schulden resseyue hym; which whanne he cam, yaf myche to hem that bileueden.
27577	44	18	28	For he greetli ouercam Jewis, and schewide opynli bi scripturis, that Jhesu is Crist.
27578	44	19	1	And it bifelle, whanne Apollo was at Corinthi, that Poul whanne he hadde go the hiyer coostis, he cam to Efesie, and foond summe of disciplis.
27579	44	19	2	And he seide to hem, Whethir ye that bileuen han resseyued the Hooli Goost? And thei seiden to hym, But nether `han we herd, if the Hooli Goost is.
27580	44	19	3	And he seide, Therfor in what thing ben ye baptisid? And thei seiden, In the baptym of Joon.
27581	44	19	4	And Poul seide, Joon baptiside the puple in baptym of penaunce, and tauyte, that thei schulden bileue in hym that was to comynge `after hym, that is, in Jhesu.
27582	44	19	5	Whanne thei herden these thingis, thei weren baptisid in the name of the Lord Jhesu.
27583	44	19	6	And whanne Poul hadde leid on hem his hoondis, the Hooli Goost cam in hem, and thei spaken with langagis, and profecieden.
27584	44	19	7	And alle weren almest twelue men.
27585	44	19	8	And he yede in to the synagoge, and spak with trist thre monethis, disputinge and tretinge of the kingdom of God.
27586	44	19	9	But whanne summe weren hardid, and bileueden not, and cursiden the weie of the Lord bifor the multitude, he yede awei fro hem, and departide the disciplis, and disputide in the scole of a myyti man eche dai.
27587	44	19	10	This was doon bi twei yeeris, so that alle that dwelliden in Asie herden the word of the Lord, Jewis and hethene men.
27588	44	19	11	And God dide vertues not smale bi the hoond of Poul,
27589	44	19	12	so that on sijk men the sudaries weren borun fro his bodye, and sijknessis departiden fro hem, and wickid spiritis wenten out.
27590	44	19	13	But also summe of the Jewis exorsisists yeden aboute, and assaieden to clepe the name of the Lord Jhesu Crist on hem that hadden yuele spiritis, and seiden, Y coniure you bi Jhesu, whom Poul prechith.
27591	44	19	14	And ther weren seuene sones of a Jewe, Steuen, a prince of preestis, that diden this thing.
27592	44	19	15	But the yuel spirit answeride, and seide to hem, Y knowe Jhesu, and Y knowe Poul; but who ben ye?
27593	44	19	16	And the man in which was the worste deuel, lippide on hem, and hadde victorie of bothe, and was stronge ayens hem, that thei nakid and woundid fledden awei fro that hous.
27594	44	19	17	And this thing was maad knowun to alle the Jewis and to hethene men, that dwelliden at Effesie; and drede felle doun on hem alle, and thei magnyfieden the name of the Lord Jhesu.
27595	44	19	18	And many men bileueden, and camen, knowlechinge and tellynge her dedis.
27596	44	19	19	And manye of them that sueden curiouse thingis, brouyten togidere bookis, and brenneden hem bifor alle men; and whanne the prices of tho weren acountid, thei founden monei of fifti thousynd pens;
27597	44	19	20	so strongli the word of God wexide, and was confermyd.
27598	44	19	21	And whanne these thingis weren fillid, Poul purposide in spirit, aftir that Macedony was passid and Acaie, to go to Jerusalem, and seide, For aftir that Y schal be there, it bihoueth me `to se also Rome.
27599	44	19	22	And he sente in to Macedonye twey men, that mynystriden to hym, Tymothe, and Eraste, and he dwellide for a tyme in Asie.
27600	44	19	23	And a greet troubling was maad in that dai, of the weie of the Lord.
27601	44	19	24	For a man, Demetrie bi name, a worcher in siluer, makide siluer housis to Diane, and yaf to crafti men myche wynnyng;
27602	44	19	25	which he clepide togidere `hem that weren suche maner werkmen, and seide, Men, ye witen that of this craft wynnyng is to vs;
27603	44	19	26	and ye seen and heren, that this Poul counseilith and turneth awei myche puple, not oonli of Effesie, but almest of al Asie, and seith, that thei ben not goddis, that ben maad with hoondis.
27604	44	19	27	And not oonli this part schal be in perel to vs, to come in to repreef, but also the temple of the greet Dian schal be acountid in to nouyt; yhe, and the maieste of hir schal bigynne to be destried, whom al Asie and the world worschipith.
27605	44	19	28	Whanne these thingis weren herd, thei weren fillid with ire, and crieden, and seiden, Greet is the Dian of Effesians.
27606	44	19	29	And the citee was fillid with confusioun, and thei maden an asaut with oon wille in to the teaatre, and tooken Gayus and Aristark, men of Macedonye, felawis of Poul.
27607	44	19	30	And whanne Poul would haue entrid in to the peple, the disciplis suffriden not.
27608	44	19	31	And also summe of the princis of Asie, that weren hise freendis, senten to him. and preieden, that he schulde not yyue hym silf in to the teatre.
27609	44	19	32	And othere men crieden othir thing; for the chirche was confusid, and many wisten not for what cause thei weren come togidere.
27610	44	19	33	But of the puple thei drowen awei oon Alisaundre, while Jewis puttiden hym forth. And Alisaundre axide with his hoond silence, and wolde yelde a resoun to the puple.
27611	44	19	34	And as thei knewen that he was a Jew, o vois of alle men was maad, criynge as bi tweyn ouris, Greet Dian of Effesians.
27612	44	19	35	And whanne the scribe hadde ceessid the puple, he seide, Men of Effesie, what man is he, that knowith not, that the citee of Effesians is the worschipere of greet Dian, and of the child of Jubiter?
27613	44	19	36	Therfor whanne it may not be ayenseid to these thingis, it behoueth you to be ceessid, and to do no thing folili;
27614	44	19	37	for ye han brouyt these men, nethir sacrilegeris, nethir blasfemynge youre goddesse.
27615	44	19	38	That if Demetrie, and the werk men that ben with hym, han cause ayens ony man, there ben courtis, and domes, and iugis; accusen thei eche other.
27616	44	19	39	If ye seken ouyt of ony othir thing, it may be assoylid in the lawful chirche.
27617	44	19	40	For whi we ben in perel to be repreuyd of this daies dissencioun, sithen no man is gilti, of whom we moun yelde resoun of this rennyng togidre. And whanne he hadde seid this thing, he lete the puple go.
27618	44	20	1	And aftir the noise ceesside, Poul clepide the disciplis, and monestide hem, and seide fare wel; and he wente forth, to go in to Macedonye.
27619	44	20	2	And whanne he hadde walkid bi tho coostis, and hadde monestid hem bi many wordis, he cam to Greece.
27620	44	20	3	Where whanne he hadde be thre monethis, the Jewis leiden aspies for hym, that was to saile in to Sirie; and he hadde counsel to turne ayen bi Macedonye.
27621	44	20	4	And Sosipater of Pirri Boroense folowide hym; of Thessolonycenses, Astirak, and Secoundus, and Gayus Derbeus, and Tymothe; and Asians, Titicus and Trofimus.
27622	44	20	5	These for thei wenten bifore, aboden vs at Troade.
27623	44	20	6	For we schippiden aftir the daies of therf looues fro Filippis, and cam to hem at Troade in fyue daies, where we dwelten seuene daies.
27624	44	20	7	And in the first dai of the woke, whanne we camen to breke breed, Poul disputide with hem, and schulde go forth in the morew;
27625	44	20	8	and he drow along the sermoun til in to mydnyyt. And many laumpes weren in the soler, where we weren gaderyd togidir.
27626	44	20	9	And a yong man, Euticus bi name, sat on the wyndowe, whanne he was fallun in to an heuy sleep, while Poul disputide long, al slepynge he felle doun fro the thridde stage; and he was takun vp, and was brouyt deed.
27627	44	20	10	To whom whanne Poul cam doun, he lay on hym, and biclippide, and seide, Nyle ye be troblid; for his soule is in hym.
27628	44	20	11	And he wente vp, and brak breed, and eete, and spak ynowy vnto the dai; and so he wente forth.
27629	44	20	12	And thei brouyten the childe alyue, and thei weren coumfortid greetli.
27630	44	20	13	And we wenten vp in to a schip, and schippiden in to Asson, to take Poul fro thennus; for so he hadde disposid to make iourney bi loond.
27631	44	20	14	And whanne he foond vs in Asson, we token hym, and camen to Mitilene.
27632	44	20	15	And fro thennus we schippiden in the dai suynge, and we camen ayens Chyum, and another dai we hauenyden at Samum, and in the dai suynge we camen to Mylete.
27633	44	20	16	And Poul purposide to schip ouer to Efesi, lest ony tariyng were maad to hym in Asie; for he hiyede, if it were possible to hym, that he schulde be in the dai of Pentecost at Jerusalem.
27634	44	20	17	Fro Mylete he sente to Effesi, and clepide the grettest men of birthe of the chirche.
27635	44	20	18	And whanne thei camen to hym, and weren togidir, he seide to hem, Ye witen fro the firste dai, in which Y cam in to Asie, hou with you bi eche tyme Y was,
27636	44	20	19	seruynge to the Lord with al mekenesse, and mildnesse, and teeris, and temptaciouns, that felden to me of aspiyngis of Jewis;
27637	44	20	20	hou Y withdrowe not of profitable thingis to you, that Y telde not to you, and tauyte you opynli, and bi housis;
27638	44	20	21	and Y witnesside to Jewis and to hethene men penaunce in to God, and feith in to oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
27639	44	20	22	And now lo! Y am boundun in spirit, and go in to Jerusalem; and Y knowe not what thingis schulen come to me in it,
27640	44	20	23	but that the Hooli Goost `bi alle citees witnessith to me, and seith, that boondis and tribulaciouns at Jerusalem abiden me.
27641	44	20	24	But Y drede no thing of these, nether Y make my lijf preciousere than my silf, so that Y end my cours, and the mynysterie of the word, which Y resseyuede of the Lord Jhesu, to witnesse the gospel of the grace of God.
27642	44	20	25	And `now lo! Y woot, that ye schulen no more se my face, alle ye bi whiche Y passide, prechynge the kingdom of God.
27643	44	20	26	Wherfor Y witnesse to you this day, that Y am cleen of the blood of alle men.
27644	44	20	27	For Y fley not awey, that Y telde not to you al the counsel of God.
27645	44	20	28	Take ye tente to you, and to al the flocke, in which the Hooli Goost hath set you bischops, to reule the chirche of God, which he purchaside with his blood.
27646	44	20	29	Y woot, that aftir my departyng, rauyschinge wolues schulen entre in to you, `and spare not the flok;
27647	44	20	30	and men spekinge schrewid thingis schulen rise of you silf, that thei leden awei disciplis aftir hem.
27648	44	20	31	For which thing wake ye, holdinge in mynde that bi thre yeer nyyt and dai Y ceesside not with teeris monestinge ech of you.
27649	44	20	32	And now Y bitake you to God and to the word of his grace, that is myyti to edifie and yyue eritage in alle that ben maad hooli.
27650	44	20	33	And of no man Y coueitide siluer, and gold, ether cloth, as you silf witen;
27651	44	20	34	for to tho thingis that weren nedeful to me, and to these that ben with me, these hoondis mynystriden.
27652	44	20	35	Alle these thingis Y schewide to you, for so it bihoueth men trauelinge to resseyue sike men, and to haue mynde of the `word of the Lord Jhesu; for he seide, It is more blesful to yyue, than to resseyue.
27653	44	20	36	And whanne he hadde seid these thingis, he knelide, and he preiede with alle hem.
27654	44	20	37	And greet weping of alle men was maad; and thei felden on the necke of Poul, and kissiden hym,
27655	44	20	38	and sorewiden moost in the word that he seide, for thei schulen no more se his face. And thei ledden hym to the schip.
27656	44	21	1	And whanne it was don, that we schulden seile, and weren passid awei fro hem, with streiyt cours we camen to Choum, and the day suynge to Rodis, and fro thennus to Patiram, and fro thennus to Myram.
27657	44	21	2	And whanne we founden a schip passinge ouer to Fenyce, we wenten vp in to it, and sailden forth.
27658	44	21	3	And whanne we apperiden to Cipre, we leften it at the left half, and seiliden in to Sirie, and camen to Tire. For there the schip schulde be vnchargid.
27659	44	21	4	And whanne we foundun disciplis, we dwelliden there seuene daies; whiche seiden bi spirit to Poul, that he schulde not go vp to Jerusalem.
27660	44	21	5	And whanne the daies weren fillid, we yeden forth, and alle men with wyues and children ledden forth vs with outen the citee; and we kneliden in the see brenke, and we preieden.
27661	44	21	6	And whanne we hadden maad fare wel togidre, we wenten vp into the schip; and thei turneden ayen in to her owne places.
27662	44	21	7	And whanne the schip sailinge was fillid fro Tire, we camen doun to Tolamayda, and whanne we hadden gret wel the britheren, we dwelliden o dai at hem.
27663	44	21	8	And another dai we yeden forth, and camen to Cesarie. And we entriden in to the hous of Filip euangelist, that was oon of the seuene, and dwelliden at hym.
27664	44	21	9	And to hym weren foure douytris, virgyns, that profecieden.
27665	44	21	10	And whanne we dwelliden there bi summe daies, a profete, Agabus bi name, cam ouer fro Judee.
27666	44	21	11	This whanne he cam to vs, took the girdil of Poul, and boond togidere hise feet and hoondis, and seide, The Hooli Goost seith these thingis, Thus Jewis schulen bynde in Jerusalem the man, whos is this girdil; and thei schulen bytake into hethene mennys hoondis.
27667	44	21	12	Which thing whanne we herden, we preieden, and thei that weren of that place, that he schulde not go vp to Jerusalem.
27668	44	21	13	Thanne Poul answeride, and seide, What doen ye, wepinge and turmentinge myn herte? For Y am redi, not oonli to be boundun, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jhesu.
27669	44	21	14	And whanne we myyten not counseile hym, we weren stille, and seiden, The wille of the Lord be don.
27670	44	21	15	And aftir these daies we weren maad redi, and wenten vp to Jerusalem.
27671	44	21	16	And summe of the disciplis camen with vs fro Cesarie, and ledden with hem a man, Jason of Cipre, an elde disciple, at whom we schulden be herborid.
27672	44	21	17	And whanne we camen to Jerusalem, britheren resseyueden vs wilfulli.
27673	44	21	18	And in the dai suynge Poul entride with vs to James, and alle the eldre men weren gaderid.
27674	44	21	19	Whiche whanne he hadde gret, he telde bi alle thingis, what God hadde doon in hethene men, bi the mynysterie of hym.
27675	44	21	20	And whanne thei herden, thei magnyfiden God, and seiden to hym, Brothir, thou seest how many thousyndis ben in Jewis, that han bileued to God, and alle ben loueris of the lawe.
27676	44	21	21	And thei herden of thee, that thou techist departing fro Moises of thilk Jewis that ben bi hethene men, that seien, that thei owen not circumcide her sones, nether owen to entre by custom.
27677	44	21	22	Therfor what is? It bihoueth that the multitude come togidre; for thei schulen here, that thou art come.
27678	44	21	23	Therfor do thou this thing, that we seien to thee. Ther ben to vs foure men, that han a vow on hem.
27679	44	21	24	Take thou these men, and halowe thee with hem; honge on hem, that thei schaue her heedis; and that alle men wite, that the thingis that thei herden of thee ben false, but that thou walkist, and thi silf kepist the lawe.
27680	44	21	25	But of these that bileueden of hethene men, we writen, demynge that thei absteyne hem fro thing offrid to idols, and fro blood, and also fro stranglid thing, and fro fornicacioun.
27681	44	21	26	Thanne Poul took the men, and in the dai suynge he was purified with hem, and entride in to the temple, and schewide the filling of daies of purifying, til the offring was offrid for ech of hem.
27682	44	21	27	And whanne seuene daies weren endid, the Jewis that weren of Asie, whanne thei saien him in the temple, stiriden al the puple, and leyden hondis on hym,
27683	44	21	28	and crieden, Men of Israel, helpe ye vs. This is the man, that ayens the puple and the lawe and this place techith euery where alle men, more ouer and hath led hethene men in to the temple, and hath defoulid this hooli place.
27684	44	21	29	For thei seyen Trofimus of Effesi in the citee with hym, whom thei gessiden that Poul hadde brouyt in to the temple.
27685	44	21	30	And al the citee was moued, and a rennyng togider of the puple was maad. And thei token Poul, and drowen him out of the temple; and anoon the yatis weren closid.
27686	44	21	31	And whanne thei souyten to sle hym, it was teld to the tribune of the cumpany of knyytis, that al Jerusalem is confoundid.
27687	44	21	32	Which anoon took knyytis, and centuriens, and ran to hem. And whanne thei hadden seen the tribune, and the knyytis, thei ceessiden to smyte Poul.
27688	44	21	33	Thanne the tribune cam, and cauyte hym, and comaundide, that he were boundun with twei cheynes; and axide, who he was, and what he hadde don.
27689	44	21	34	But othere crieden other thing among the puple. And whanne he miyte `knowe no certeyn thing for the noise, he comaundide hym to be led in to the castels.
27690	44	21	35	And whanne Poul cam to the grees, it bifel that he was borun of kniytis, for strengthe of the puple.
27691	44	21	36	For the multitude of the puple suede hym, and criede, Take hym awei.
27692	44	21	37	And whanne Poul bigan to be led in to the castels, he seide to the tribune, Whether it is leueful `to me, to speke ony thing to thee?
27693	44	21	38	And he seide, Kanst thou Greek? Whether thou art not the Egipcian, which bifor these daies mouedist a noise, and leddist out in to desert foure thousynde of men, mensleeris?
27694	44	21	39	And Poul seide to hym, For Y am a Jew, of Tharse of Cilicie, a citeseyn, which citee is not vnknowun. And Y preye thee, suffre me to speke to the puple.
27695	44	21	40	And whanne he suffride, Poul stood in the grees, and bikenede with the hoond to the puple. And whanne a greet silence was maad, he spak in Ebrew tunge, and seide,
27696	44	22	1	Britheren and fadris, here ye what resoun Y yelde now to you.
27697	44	22	2	And whanne sum herden that in Ebrew tunge he spak to hem, thei yauen the more silence.
27698	44	22	3	And he seide, Y am a man a Jew, borun at Tharse of Cilicie, nurischid and in this citee bisidis the feet of Gamaliel, tauyt bi the treuthe of fadris lawe, a louyere of the lawe, as also ye alle ben to dai.
27699	44	22	4	And Y pursuede this weie til to the deth, byndynge and bitakinge `in to holdis men and wymmen,
27700	44	22	5	as the prince of prestis yeldith witnessyng to me, and alle the grettest in birth. Of whom also Y took pistlis to britheren, and wente to Damask, to bring fro thennys men boundun in to Jerusalem, that thei schulden be peyned.
27701	44	22	6	And it was don, while Y yede, and neiyede to Damask, at myddai sudeynli fro heuene a greet plente of liyt schoon aboute me.
27702	44	22	7	And Y felde doun to the erthe, and herde a voice fro heuene, seiynge to me, Saul, Saul, what pursuest thou me? It is hard to thee to kike ayens the pricke.
27703	44	22	8	And Y answeride, Who art thou, Lord? And he seide to me, Y am Jhesu of Nazareth, whom thou pursuest.
27704	44	22	9	And thei that weren with me sien but the liyt, but thei herden not the vois of hym, that spak with me.
27705	44	22	10	And Y seide, Lord, what schal Y do? And the Lord seide to me, Rise thou, and go to Damask; and there it schal be seid to thee, of alle thingis which it bihoueth thee to do.
27706	44	22	11	And whanne Y saye not, for the clerete of that liyt, Y was led bi the hond of felowis, and Y cam to Damask.
27707	44	22	12	And a man, Ananye, that bi the lawe hadde wytnessyng of alle Jewis dwellinge in Damask,
27708	44	22	13	cam to me, and stood niy, and seide to me, Saul, brother, biholde. And Y in the same our biheelde in to hym.
27709	44	22	14	And he seide, God of oure fadris hath bifor ordeyned thee, that thou schuldist knowe the wille of him, and schuldist se the riytful man, and here the vois of his mouth.
27710	44	22	15	For thou schalt be his witnesse to alle men, of tho thingis that thou hast seyn and herd.
27711	44	22	16	And now, what dwellist thou? Rise vp, and be baptisid, and waische awei thi synnes, bi the name of hym clepid to help.
27712	44	22	17	And it was don to me, as Y turnede ayen in to Jerusalem, and preyede in the temple, that Y was maad in rauysching of soule,
27713	44	22	18	and Y siy him seiynge to me, Hiye thou, and go out faste of Jerusalem, for thei schulen not resseyue thi witnessing of me.
27714	44	22	19	And Y seide, Lord, thei witen, that Y was closing togidir `in to prisoun, and betinge bi synagogis hem that bileueden `in to thee.
27715	44	22	20	And whanne the blood of Steuene, thi witnesse, was sched out, Y stood niy, and consentide, and kept the clothis of men that slowen hym.
27716	44	22	21	And he seide to me, Go thou, for Y schal sende thee fer to naciouns.
27717	44	22	22	And thei herden him til this word; and thei reiseden her vois, and seiden, Take awei fro the erthe siche a maner man; for it is not leueful, that he lyue.
27718	44	22	23	And whanne thei crieden, and kesten awei her clothis, and threwen dust in to the eir,
27719	44	22	24	the tribune comaundide hym to be led in to castels, and to be betun with scourgis, and to be turmentid, that he wiste, for what cause thei crieden so to him.
27720	44	22	25	And whanne thei hadden boundun hym with cordis, Poul seide to a centurien stondinge niy to hym, Whether it is leueful to you, to scourge a Romayn, and vndampned?
27721	44	22	26	And whanne this thing was herd, the centurien wente to the tribune, and telde to hym, and seide, What art thou to doynge? for this man is a citeseyn of Rome.
27722	44	22	27	And the tribune cam niy, and seide to hym, Seie thou to me, whether thou art a Romayn?
27723	44	22	28	And he seide, Yhe. And the tribune answeride, Y with myche summe gat this fredom. And Poul seide, And Y was borun a citeseyn of Rome.
27724	44	22	29	Therfor anoon thei that schulden haue turmentid hym, departiden awei fro hym. And the tribune dredde, aftir that he wiste, that he was a citeseyn of Rome, and for he hadde boundun hym.
27725	44	22	30	But in the dai suynge he wolde wite more diligentli, for what cause he were accusid of the Jewis, and vnbounde hym, and comaundide prestis and al the counsel to come togidir. And he brouyte forth Poul, and sette hym among hem.
27726	44	23	1	And Poul bihelde in to the counsel, and seide, Britheren, Y with al good conscience haue lyued bifore God, `til in to this dai.
27727	44	23	2	And Anany, prince of prestis, comaundide to men that stoden nyy hym, that thei schulden smyte his mouth.
27728	44	23	3	Thanne Poul seide to hym, Thou whitid wal, God smyte thee; thou sittist, and demest me bi the lawe, and ayens the law thou comaundist me to be smytun.
27729	44	23	4	And thei that stoden niy, seiden, Cursist thou the hiyest prest of God?
27730	44	23	5	And Poul seide, Britheren, Y wiste not, that he is prince of preestis; for it is writun, Thou schalt not curse the prince of thi puple.
27731	44	23	6	But Poul wiste, that o parti was of Saduceis, and the othere of Fariseis; and he criede in the counsel, Britheren, Y am a Farisee, the sone of Farisees; Y am demyd of the hope and of the ayen rising of deed men.
27732	44	23	7	And whanne he hadde seid this thing, dissencioun was maad bitwixe the Fariseis and the Saduceis, and the multitude was departid.
27733	44	23	8	For Saduceis seien, that no `rysing ayen of deed men is, nether aungel, nether spirit; but Fariseis knowlechen euer eithir.
27734	44	23	9	And a greet cry was maad. And summe of Farisees rosen vp, and fouyten, seiynge, We fynden no thing of yuel in this man; what if a spirit, ether an aungel spak to hym?
27735	44	23	10	And whanne greet discencioun was maad, the tribune dredde, lest Poul schulde be to-drawun of hem; and he comaundide knyytis to go doun, and to take hym fro the myddil of hem, and to lede hym in to castels.
27736	44	23	11	And in the niyt suynge the Lord stood niy to hym, and seide, Be thou stidfast; for as thou hast witnessid of me in Jerusalem, so it bihoueth thee to witnesse also at Rome.
27737	44	23	12	And whanne the dai was come, summe of the Jewis gaderiden hem, and maden `avow, and seiden, that thei schulden nether eete, ne drinke, til thei slowen Poul.
27738	44	23	13	And there weren mo than fourti men, that maden this sweryng togider.
27739	44	23	14	And thei wenten to the princis of prestis, and eldre men, and seiden, With deuocioun we han a vowid, that we schulen not taste ony thing, til we sleen Poul.
27740	44	23	15	Now therfor make ye knowun to the tribune, with the counsel, that he bringe hym forth to you, as if ye schulden knowe sum thing more certeynli of hym; and we ben redi to sle hym, bifor that he come.
27741	44	23	16	And whanne the sone of Poulis sister hadde herd the aspies, he cam, and entride in to the castels, and telde to Poul.
27742	44	23	17	And Poul clepide to hym oon of the centuriens, and seide, Lede this yonge man to the tribune, for he hath sum thing to schewe to hym.
27743	44	23	18	And he took hym, and ledde to the tribune, and seide, Poul, that is boundun, preide me to lede to thee this yonge man, that hath sum thing to speke to thee.
27744	44	23	19	And the tribune took his hoond, and wente with hym asidis half, and axide hym, What thing is it, that thou hast to schewe to me?
27745	44	23	20	And he seide, The Jewis ben acordid to preye thee, that to morewe thou brynge forth Poul in to the counsel, as if thei schulden enquere sum thing more certeynli of hym.
27746	44	23	21	But bileue thou not to hem; for mo than fourti men of hem aspien hym, which han a vowid, that thei schulen not eete nether drynke, til thei sleen hym; and now thei ben redi, abidinge thi biheest.
27747	44	23	22	Therfor the tribune lefte the yonge man, and comaundide, that he schulde speke to no man, that he hadde maad these thingis knowun to hym.
27748	44	23	23	And he clepide togidre twei centuriens, and he seide to hem, Make ye redi twei hundrid knyytis, that thei go to Cesarie, and horse men seuenti, and spere men twey hundrid, fro the thridde our of the nyyt.
27749	44	23	24	And make ye redy an hors, for Poul to ride on, to lede hym saaf to Felix, the presydent.
27750	44	23	25	For the tribune dredde, lest the Jewis wolden take hym bi the weie, and sle hym, and aftirward he miyte be chalengid, as he hadde take money.
27751	44	23	26	And wroot hym `a pistle, conteynynge these thingis. Claudius Lisias to the beste Felix, president, heelthe.
27752	44	23	27	This man that was take of the Jewis, and bigan to be slayn, Y cam vpon hem with myn oost, and delyuerede hym fro hem, whanne Y knewe that he was a Romayn.
27753	44	23	28	And Y wolde wite the cause, which thei puttiden ayens hym; and Y ledde hym to the counsel of hem.
27754	44	23	29	And Y foond, that he was accusid of questiouns of her lawe, but he hadde no cryme worthi the deth, ethir boondis.
27755	44	23	30	And whanne it was teeld me of the aspies, that thei arayden for hym, Y sente hym to thee, and Y warnede also the accuseris, that thei seie at thee. Fare wel.
27756	44	23	31	And so the knyytis, as thei weren comaundid, token Poul, and ledde hym bi nyyt into Antipatriden.
27757	44	23	32	And in the dai suynge, whanne the horsmen weren left, that schulden go with hym, thei turneden ayen to the castels.
27758	44	23	33	And whanne thei camen to Cesarie, thei token the pistle to the president, and thei setten also Poul byfore him.
27759	44	23	34	And whanne he hadde red, and axide, of what prouynce he was, and knewe that he was of Cilicie,
27760	44	23	35	Y schal here thee, he seide, whanne thin accuseris comen. And he comaundide hym to be kept in the moot halle of Eroude.
27761	44	24	1	And aftir fyue daies, Ananye, prince of preestis, cam doun with summe eldere men, and Terculle, a feir speker, which wenten to the precident ayens Poul.
27762	44	24	2	And whanne Poul was somened, Terculle bigan to accuse hym, and seide, Whanne in myche pees we doon bi thee, and many thingis ben amendid bi thi wisdom, euere more and euery where,
27763	44	24	3	thou best Felix, we han resseyued with al doyng of thankingis.
27764	44	24	4	But lest Y tarie thee lengere, Y preie thee, schortly here vs for thi mekenesse.
27765	44	24	5	We han foundun this wickid man stirynge dissencioun to alle Jewis in al the world, and auctour of dissencioun of the secte of Nazarenus; and he also enforside to defoule the temple;
27766	44	24	6	whom also we token, and wolden deme, after oure lawe.
27767	44	24	7	But Lisias, the trybune, cam with greet strengthe aboue, and delyuerede hym fro oure hoondis;
27768	44	24	8	and comaundide hise accuseris to come to thee, of whom thou demynge, maist knowe of alle these thingis, of whiche we accusen hym.
27769	44	24	9	And Jewis putten to, and seiden, that these thingis hadden hem so.
27770	44	24	10	And Poul answeride, whanne the president grauntide hym to seie, Of mony yeeris Y knowe thee, that thou art domesman `to this folk, and Y schal do ynowy for me with good resoun.
27771	44	24	11	For thou maist knowe, for to me ben not more than twelue daies, sithen Y cam vp to worschipe in Jerusalem;
27772	44	24	12	and nether in the temple thei founden me disputinge with ony man, nether makynge concours of puple, nether in synagogis, nether in citee;
27773	44	24	13	nether thei moun preue to thee, of the whiche thingis thei now accusen me.
27774	44	24	14	But Y knowleche to thee this thing, that aftir the secte which thei seien eresie, so Y serue to God the fadir, `and Y bileue to alle thingis that ben writun in the lawe and profetis; and Y haue hope in God,
27775	44	24	15	whiche also thei hem silf abiden, the ayenrisyng `to comynge of iust men and wickid.
27776	44	24	16	In this thing Y studie with outen hirtyng, to haue concience to God, and to men euermore.
27777	44	24	17	But after many yeeris, Y cam to do almes dedis to my folc, and offryngis, and auowis;
27778	44	24	18	in whiche thei founden me purified in the temple, not with company, nether with noise. And thei cauyten me, and thei crieden, and seiden, Take awei oure enemye.
27779	44	24	19	And summe Jewis of Asie, whiche it behofte to be now present at thee, and accuse, if thei hadden ony thing ayens me,
27780	44	24	20	ether these hem silf seie, if thei founden in me ony thing of wickidnesse, sithen Y stonde `in the counsel,
27781	44	24	21	but oneli of this vois, by which Y criede stondynge among hem, For of the ayenrisyng of deed men Y am demyd this dai of you.
27782	44	24	22	Sothely Felix delayede hem, and knewe moost certeynli of the weie, and seide, Whanne Lisias, the tribune, schal come doun, Y schal here you.
27783	44	24	23	And he comaundide to a centurien to kepe hym, and that he hadde reste, nethir to forbede ony man to mynystre of his owne thingis to him.
27784	44	24	24	And after summe dayes Felix cam, with Drussille his wijf, that was a Jewesse, and clepide Poul, and herde of him the feith that is in Crist Jhesu.
27785	44	24	25	And while he disputide of riytwisnesse, and chastite, and of dom to comynge, Felix was maad tremblinge, and answerde, That perteneth now, go; but in tyme couenable Y schal clepe thee.
27786	44	24	26	Also he hopide, that money schulde be youun to hym of Poul; for which thing eft he clepide hym, and spak with hym.
27787	44	24	27	And whanne twei yeeris weren fillid, Felix took a successoure, Porcius Festus; and Felix wolde yyue grace to Jewis, and lefte Poul boundun.
27788	44	25	1	Therfor whanne Festus cam in to the prouynce, aftir the thridde dai he wente vp to Jerusalem fro Cesarie.
27789	44	25	2	And the princis of prestis, and the worthieste of the Jewis wenten to hym ayens Poul, and preieden hym,
27790	44	25	3	and axiden grace ayens hym, that he schulde comaunde hym to be led to Jerusalem; and thei settiden aspies to sle hym in the weie.
27791	44	25	4	But Festus answerde, that Poul schulde be kept in Cesarie; sotheli that he hym silf schulde procede more auisili. Therfor he seide, Thei that in you ben myyti,
27792	44	25	5	come doun togidere; and if ony crime is in the man, accuse thei hym.
27793	44	25	6	And he dwellede among hem no more than eiyte ether ten daies, and cam doun to Cesarie; and the tother dai he sat for domesman, and comaundide Poul to be brouyt.
27794	44	25	7	And whanne he was brouyt forth, Jewis stoden aboute hym, whiche camen doun fro Jerusalem, puttynge ayens hym many and greuouse causis, whiche thei miyten not preue.
27795	44	25	8	For Poul yeldide resoun in alle thingis, That nether ayens the lawe of Jewis, nether ayens the temple, nether ayens the emperoure, Y synnede ony thing.
27796	44	25	9	But Festus wolde do grace to the Jewis, and answeride to Poul, and seide, Wolt thou gon vp to Jerusalem, and there be demyd of these thingis bifore me?
27797	44	25	10	And Poul seide, At the domplace of the emperour Y stonde, where it bihoueth me to be demed. Y haue not noied the Jewis, as thou knowist wel.
27798	44	25	11	For if Y haue noyed, ether don ony thing worthi deth, Y forsake not to die; but if no thing of tho is, that thei accusen me, no man may yyue me to hem. Y appele to the emperour.
27799	44	25	12	Thanne Festus spak with the counsel, and answerde, To the emperoure thou hast appelid, to the emperoure thou schalt go.
27800	44	25	13	And whanne summe daies weren passid, Agrippa kyng, and Beronyce camen doun to Cesarie, to welcome Festus.
27801	44	25	14	And whanne thei dwelliden there many daies, Festus schewide to the king of Poul, and seide, A man is left boundun of Felix,
27802	44	25	15	of which, whanne Y was at Jerusalem, princis of preestis and the eldre men of Jewis camen to me, and axiden dampnacioun ayens hym.
27803	44	25	16	To whiche Y answeride, That it is not custom to Romayns, to dampne ony man, bifore that he that is accusid haue hise accuseris present, and take place of defending, to putte awei the crymes, that ben putte ayens hym.
27804	44	25	17	Therfor whanne thei camen togidere hidir, withouten ony delaye, in the dai suynge Y sat for domesman, and comaundide the man to be brouyt.
27805	44	25	18	And whanne hise accuseris stoden, thei seiden no cause, of whiche thingis Y hadde suspicioun of yuel.
27806	44	25	19	But thei hadden ayens hym summe questiouns of her veyn worschiping, and of oon Jhesu deed, whom Poul affermyde to lyue.
27807	44	25	20	And Y doutide of siche maner questioun, and seide, Whether he wolde go to Jerusalem, and ther be demyd of these thingis?
27808	44	25	21	But for Poul appelide, that he schulde be kept to the knowing of the emperoure, Y comaundide him to be kept, til Y sende hym to the emperoure.
27809	44	25	22	And Agrippa seide to Festus, Y my silf wolde here the man. And he seide, To morew thou schalt here hym.
27810	44	25	23	And on the tother day, whanne Agrippa and Beronyce camen with greet desire, and entriden in to the auditorie, with tribunes and the principal men of the citee, whanne Festus bad, Poul was brouyt.
27811	44	25	24	And Festus seide, King Agrippa, and alle men that ben with vs, ye seen this man, of which al the multitude of Jewis preyede me at Jerusalem, and axide, and criede, that he schulde lyue no lenger.
27812	44	25	25	But Y foond, that he hadde don no thing worthi of deth; and Y deme to sende hym to the emperoure, for he appelide this thing.
27813	44	25	26	Of which man Y haue not certeyne, what thing Y schal write to the lord. For which thing Y brouyte hym to you, and moost to thee, thou king Agrippa, that whanne axing is maad, Y haue what Y schal write.
27814	44	25	27	For it is seyn to me with out resoun, to sende a boundun man, and not to signifie the cause of hym.
27815	44	26	1	And Agrippa seide to Poul, It is suffrid to thee, to speke for thi silf. Thanne Poul helde forth the hoond, and bigan to yelde resoun.
27816	44	26	2	Of alle thingis, in whiche Y am accusid of the Jewis, thou king Agrippa, Y gesse me blessid at thee, whanne Y schal defende me this dai;
27817	44	26	3	moost for thou knowist alle thingis that ben among Jewis, customes and questiouns. For which thing, Y biseche, here me pacientli.
27818	44	26	4	For alle Jewis that bifor knewen me fro the bigynnyng, knewen my lijf fro yongthe; that fro the bigynnyng was in my folc in Jerusalem,
27819	44	26	5	if thei wolen bere witnessing, that bi the moost certeyn sect of oure religioun, Y lyuede a Farisee.
27820	44	26	6	And now for the hope of repromyssioun, that is maad to oure fadris of God, Y stonde suget in dom;
27821	44	26	7	in which hope oure twelue lynagis seruynge niyt and dai hopen to come; of which hope, sir king, Y am accusid of the Jewis.
27822	44	26	8	What vnbileueful thing is demed at you, if God reisith deed men?
27823	44	26	9	And sotheli Y gesside, that Y ouyte do many contrarie thingis ayens the name of Jhesu Nazarene.
27824	44	26	10	Which thing also Y dide in Jerusalem, and Y encloside manye of the seyntis in prisoun, whanne Y hadde take powere of the princis of preestis. And whanne thei weren slayn, Y brouyte the sentence.
27825	44	26	11	And bi alle synagogis ofte Y punyschide hem, and constreynede to blasfeme; and more Y wex wood ayens hem, and pursuede in to alien citees.
27826	44	26	12	In whiche, the while Y wente to Damask, with power and suffring of princis of preestis,
27827	44	26	13	at myddai, in the weie Y say, sir king, that fro heuene liyt schynede aboute me, passing the schynyng of the sunne, and aboute hem that weren togidir with me.
27828	44	26	14	And whanne we alle hadden falle doun in to the erthe, Y herde a vois seiynge to me in Ebrew tunge, Saul, Saul, what pursuest thou me? it is hard to thee, to kicke ayens the pricke.
27829	44	26	15	And Y seide, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord seide, Y am Jhesus, whom thou pursuest.
27830	44	26	16	But rise vp, and stoond on thi feet. For whi to this thing Y apperide to thee, that Y ordeyne thee mynystre and witnesse of tho thingis that thou hast seyn, and of tho in whiche Y schal schewe to thee.
27831	44	26	17	And Y schal delyuere thee fro puplis and folkis, to whiche now Y sende thee,
27832	44	26	18	to opene the iyen of hem, that thei ben conuertid fro derknesse to liyt, and fro power of Sathnas to God, that thei take remyssioun of synnes, and part among seyntis, bi feith that is in me.
27833	44	26	19	Wherfor, sir kyng Agrippa, Y was not vnbileueful to the heuenli visioun;
27834	44	26	20	but Y tolde to hem that been at Damask first, and at Jerusalem, and bi al the cuntre of Judee, and to hethene men, that thei schulden do penaunce, and be conuertid to God, and do worthi werkis of penaunce.
27835	44	26	21	For this cause Jewis token me, whanne Y was in the temple, to sle me.
27836	44	26	22	But Y was holpun bi the helpe of God in to this dai, and stonde, witnessinge to lesse and to more. And Y seye no thing ellis than whiche thingis the prophetis and Moises spaken that schulen come,
27837	44	26	23	if Crist is to suffre, if he is the firste of the ayenrising of deed men, that schal schewe liyt to the puple and to hethene men.
27838	44	26	24	Whanne he spak these thingis, and yeldide resoun, Festus seide with greet vois, Poul, thou maddist; many lettris turnen thee to woodnesse.
27839	44	26	25	And Poul seide, Y madde not, thou beste Festus, but Y speke out the wordis of treuthe and of sobernesse.
27840	44	26	26	For also the king, to whom Y speke stidfastli, woot of these thingis; for Y deme, that no thing of these is hid fro hym; for nether in a cornere was ouyt of these thingis don.
27841	44	26	27	Bileuest thou, king Agrippa, `to prophetis? Y woot that thou bileuest.
27842	44	26	28	And Agrippa seide to Poul, In litil thing thou counseilist me to be maad a cristen man.
27843	44	26	29	And Poul seide, Y desire anentis God, bothe in litil and in greet, not oneli thee, but alle these that heren to dai, to be maad sich as Y am, outakun these boondis.
27844	44	26	30	And the kyng roos vp, and the president, and Beronyce, and thei that saten niy to hem.
27845	44	26	31	And whanne thei wenten awei, thei spaken togider, and seiden, That this man hath not don ony thing worthi deth, nether boondis.
27846	44	26	32	And Agrippa seide to Festus, This man miyt be delyuerid, if he hadde not appelid to the emperour.
27847	44	27	1	But as it was demed hym to schippe into Ytalie, thei bitoken Poul with othere kepers to a centurien, bi name Julius, of the cumpeny of knyytis of the emperoure.
27848	44	27	2	And we wenten vp in to the schip of Adrymetis, and bigunnen to seile, and weren borun aboute the placis of Asie, while Aristark of Macedonye, Tessalonycence, dwellide stille with vs.
27849	44	27	3	And in the dai suynge, we camen to Sydon; and Julius tretyde curteisli Poul, and suffride to go to frendis, and do his nedis.
27850	44	27	4	And whanne we remouede fro thennus, we vndurseiliden to Cipre, for that wyndis weren contrarie.
27851	44	27	5	And we seiliden in the see of Silicie and Pamfilie, and camen to Listris, that is Licie.
27852	44	27	6	And there the centurien foond a schip of Alisaundre, seilinge in to Ytalie, and puttide vs ouer in to it.
27853	44	27	7	And whanne in many daies we seilden slowli, and vnnethe camen ayens Guydum, for the winde lettide vs, we seiliden to Crete, bisidis Salomona.
27854	44	27	8	And vnnethe we seilden bisidis, and camen into a place, that is clepid of good hauen, to whom the cite Tessala was niy.
27855	44	27	9	And whanne miche time was passid, and whanne seiling thanne was not sikir, for that fasting was passid, Poul coumfortide hem,
27856	44	27	10	and seide to hem, Men, Y se that seiling bigynneth to be with wrong and myche harm, not oonli of charge and of the schip, but also of oure lyues.
27857	44	27	11	But the centurien bileuede more to the gouernour, and to the lord of the schip, thanne to these thingis that weren seid of Poul.
27858	44	27	12	And whanne the hauene was not able to dwelle in wynter, ful many ordeyneden counsel to seile fro thennus, if on ony maner thei miyten come to Fenyce, to dwelle in wynter at the hauene of Crete, which biholdith to Affrik, and to Corum.
27859	44	27	13	And whanne the south blew, thei gessiden hem to holde purpos; and whanne thei hadden removed fro Asson, thei seiliden to Crete.
27860	44	27	14	And not aftir miche, the wynde Tifonyk, that is clepid north eest, was ayens it.
27861	44	27	15	And whanne the schip was rauyschid, and myyte not enforse ayens the wynde, whanne the schip was youun to the blowynges of the wynde, we weren borun with cours into an ile,
27862	44	27	16	that is clepid Canda; and vnethe we miyten gete a litil boot.
27863	44	27	17	And whanne this was takun vp, thei vsiden helpis, girdinge togidere the schippe; and dredden, lest thei schulden falle into sondi placis. And whanne the vessel was vndur set, so thei weren borun.
27864	44	27	18	And for we weren throwun with strong tempest, in the dai suynge thei maden casting out.
27865	44	27	19	And the thridde dai with her hoondis thei castiden awei the instrumentis of the schip.
27866	44	27	20	And whanne the sunne nether the sterris weren seie bi many daies, and tempest not a litil neiyede, now al the hope of oure helthe was don awei.
27867	44	27	21	And whanne myche fasting hadde be, thanne Poul stood in the myddil of hem, and seide, A! men, it bihofte, whanne ye herden me, not to haue take awei the schip fro Crete, and gete this wronge and casting out.
27868	44	27	22	And now Y counsel you to be of good coumfort, for los of no persoone of you schal be, outakun of the schip.
27869	44	27	23	For an aungel of God, whos Y am, and to whom Y serue, stood niy to me in this niyt, and seide, Poul, drede thou not;
27870	44	27	24	it bihoueth thee to stonde bifore the emperour. And lo! God hath youun to thee alle that ben in the schip with thee.
27871	44	27	25	For which thing, ye men, be ye of good coumfort; for Y bileue to my God, that so it schal be, as it is seid to me.
27872	44	27	26	And it bihoueth vs to come into sum yle.
27873	44	27	27	But aftirward that in the fourtenthe dai the niyt cam on vs seilinge in the stony see, aboute mydniyt the schipmen supposiden sum cuntre to appere to hem.
27874	44	27	28	And thei kesten doun a plommet, and founden twenti pasis of depnesse. And aftir a litil thei weren departid fro thennus, and foundun fiftene pasis.
27875	44	27	29	And thei dredden, lest we schulden haue fallun in to scharp placis; and fro the last parti of the schip thei senten foure ankeris, and desiriden that the dai hadde be come.
27876	44	27	30	And whanne the schipmen souyten to fle fro the schip, whanne thei hadden sent a litil boot in to the see, vndur colour as thei schulden bigynne to stretche forth the ankeris fro the formere part of the schip,
27877	44	27	31	Poul seide to the centurien and to the knyytis, But these dwellen in the schip, ye moun not be maad saaf.
27878	44	27	32	Thanne knyytis kittiden awei the cordis of the litil boot, and suffriden it to falle awei.
27879	44	27	33	And whanne the dai was come, Poul preiede alle men to take mete, and seide, The fourtenthe dai this dai ye `abiden, and dwellen fastinge, and taken no thing.
27880	44	27	34	Wherfor Y preie you to take mete, for youre helthe; for of noon of you the heer of the heed schal perische.
27881	44	27	35	And whanne he hadde seid these thingis, Poul took breed, and dide thankyngis to God in the siyt of alle men; and whanne he hadde brokun, he bigan to eete.
27882	44	27	36	And alle weren maad of betere coumfort, and thei token mete.
27883	44	27	37	And we weren alle men in the schip, two hundrid seuenti and sexe.
27884	44	27	38	And thei weren fillid with mete, and dischargiden the schip, and castiden whete in to the see.
27885	44	27	39	And whanne the dai was comun, thei knewen no lond; and thei bihelden an hauene that hadde a watir bank, in to which thei thouyten, if thei miyten, to bringe vp the schip.
27886	44	27	40	And whanne thei hadden take vp the ankeris, thei bitoken hem to the see, and slakiden togidir the ioyntours of gouernails. And with a litil seil lift vp, bi blowyng of the wynde thei wenten to the bank.
27887	44	27	41	And whanne we felden into a place of grauel gon al aboute with the see, thei hurtliden the schip. And whanne the formere part was fitchid, it dwellide vnmouable, and the last part was brokun of strengthe of the see.
27888	44	27	42	And counsel of the kniytis was, to sle men that weren in warde, lest ony schulde ascape, whanne he hadde swymmed out.
27889	44	27	43	But the centurien wolde kepe Poul, and forbede it to be don. And he comaundide hem that miyte swymme, to go in to the see, and scape, and go out to the loond.
27890	44	27	44	And thei baren summe othere on boordis, summe on tho thingis that weren of the schip. And so it was don, that alle men ascapiden to the lond.
27891	44	28	1	And whanne we hadden ascapid, thanne we knewen that the ile was clepid Militene. And the hethene men diden to vs not litil curtesie.
27892	44	28	2	And whanne a fier was kyndelid, thei refreschiden vs alle, for the reyn that cam, and the coold.
27893	44	28	3	But whanne Poul hadde gederid `a quantite of kittingis of vines, and leide on the fier, an edder sche cam forth fro the heete, and took hym bi the hoond.
27894	44	28	4	And whanne the hethene men of the ile siyen the beest hangynge in his hoond, thei seiden togidir, For this man is a manquellere; and whanne he scapide fro the see, Goddis veniaunce suffrith hym not to lyue in erthe.
27895	44	28	5	But he schoke awei the beest in to the fier, and hadde noon harm.
27896	44	28	6	And thei gessiden that he schulde be turned `in to swellyng, and falle doun sudenli, and die. But whanne thei abiden longe, and sien that no thing of yuel was don in him, thei turneden hem togider, and seiden, that he was God.
27897	44	28	7	And in tho placis weren maners of the prince of the ile, Puplius bi name, which resseyuede vs bi thre daies benygnli, and foond vs.
27898	44	28	8	And it bifel, that the fader of Pupplius lai trauelid with fyueris and blodi flux. To whom Poul entride, and whanne he hadde preied, and leid his hondis on hym, he helide hym.
27899	44	28	9	And whanne this thing was don, alle that in the ile hadden sijknesses, camen, and weren heelid.
27900	44	28	10	Which also onouriden vs in many worschipis, and puttiden what thingis weren necessarie to vs, whanne we schippiden.
27901	44	28	11	And after thre monethis we schippiden in a schip of Alisaundre, that hadde wyntrid in the ile, to which was an excellent singne of Castours.
27902	44	28	12	And whanne we camen to Siracusan, we dwelliden there thre daies.
27903	44	28	13	Fro thennus we seiliden aboute, and camen to Regyum; and aftir oo dai, while the south blew, in the secounde dai we camen to Puteolos.
27904	44	28	14	Where whanne we founden britheren, we weren preied to dwelle there anentis hem seuene daies. And so we camen to Rome.
27905	44	28	15	And fro thennus whanne britheren hadden herd, thei camen to vs to the cheping of Appius, and to the Thre tauernes.
27906	44	28	16	And whanne Poul hadde seyn hem, he dide thankyngis to God, and took trist. And whanne `we camen to Rome, it was suffrid to Poul to dwelle bi hym silf, with a kniyt kepinge him.
27907	44	28	17	And after the thridde dai, he clepide togidir the worthieste of the Jewis. And whanne thei camen, he seide to hem, Britheren, Y dide no thing ayens the puple ether custom of fadris, and Y was boundun at Jerusalem, and was bitakun in to the hondis of Romayns.
27908	44	28	18	And whanne thei hadden axid of me, wolden haue delyuerid me, for that no cause of deth was in me.
27909	44	28	19	But for Jewis ayenseiden, Y was constreyned to appele to the emperour; not as hauynge ony thing to accuse my puple.
27910	44	28	20	Therfor for this cause Y preiede to se you, and speke to you; for for the hope of Israel Y am gird aboute with this chayne.
27911	44	28	21	And thei seiden to hym, Nether we han resseyued lettris of thee fro Judee, nether ony of britheren comynge schewide, ether spak ony yuel thing of thee.
27912	44	28	22	But we preyen to here of thee, what thingis thou felist; for of this sect it is knowun to vs, that euerywhere me ayenseith it.
27913	44	28	23	And whanne thei hadden ordeined a dai to hym, many men camen to hym in to the in. To whiche he expownede, witnessinge the kyngdom `of God, and counseilide hem of Jhesu, of the lawe of Moyses, and profetis, for the morewe til to euentid.
27914	44	28	24	And summe bileueden to these thingis that weren seid of Poul, summe bileueden not.
27915	44	28	25	And whanne thei weren not consentinge togidir, thei departiden. And Poul seide o word, For the Hooli Goost spak wel bi Ysaye, the profete, to oure fadris,
27916	44	28	26	and seide, Go thou to this puple, and seie to hem, With eere ye schulen here, and ye schulen not vndirstonde; and ye seynge schulen se, and ye schulen not biholde.
27917	44	28	27	For the herte of this puple is greetli fattid, and with eeris thei herden heuyli, and thei closiden togider her iyen, lest perauenture thei se with iyen, and with eeris here, and bi herte vndurstonde, and be conuertid, and Y hele hem.
27918	44	28	28	Therfor be it knowun to you, that this helthe of God is sent to hethen men, and thei schulen here.
27919	44	28	29	And whanne he hadde seid these thingis, Jewis wenten out fro hym, and hadden myche questioun, ethir musyng, among hem silf.
27920	44	28	30	And he dwellide ful twei yeer in his hirid place; and he resseyuede alle that entryden to hym,
27921	44	28	31	and prechide the kingdom of God, and tauyte tho thingis that ben of the Lord Jhesu Crist, with al trist, with out forbedyng. Amen.
27922	45	1	1	Poul, the seruaunt of Jhesu Crist, clepid an apostle, departid in to the gospel of God;
27923	45	1	2	which he hadde bihote tofore bi his profetis in holi scripturis of his sone,
27924	45	1	3	which is maad to hym of the seed of Dauid bi the flesch,
27925	45	1	4	and he was bifor ordeyned the sone of God in vertu, bi the spirit of halewyng of the ayenrisyng of deed men, of Jhesu Crist oure Lord,
27926	45	1	5	bi whom we han resseyued grace and the office of apostle, to obeie to the feith in alle folkis for his name,
27927	45	1	6	among whiche ye ben also clepid of Jhesu Crist,
27928	45	1	7	to alle that ben at Rome, derlyngis of God, and clepid hooli, grace to you, and pees of God oure fadir, and of the Lord Jhesu Crist.
27929	45	1	8	First Y do thankyngis to my God, bi Jhesu Crist, for alle you, for youre feith is schewid in al the world.
27930	45	1	9	For God is a witnesse to me, to whom Y serue in my spirit, in the gospel of his sone,
27931	45	1	10	that with outen ceessyng Y make mynde of you euere in my preieris, and biseche, if in ony maner sum tyme Y haue a spedi weie in the wille of God to come to you.
27932	45	1	11	For Y desire to se you, to parten sumwhat of spiritual grace,
27933	45	1	12	that ye be confermyd, that is, to be coumfortid togidere in you, bi feith that is bothe youre and myn togidere.
27934	45	1	13	And, britheren, Y nyle, that ye vnknowun, that ofte Y purposide to come to you, and Y am lett to this tyme, that Y haue sum fruyt in you, as in othere folkis.
27935	45	1	14	To Grekis and to barberyns, to wise men and to vnwise men,
27936	45	1	15	Y am dettour, so that that is in me is redi to preche the gospel also to you that ben at Rome.
27937	45	1	16	For Y schame not the gospel, for it is the vertu of God in to heelthe to ech man that bileueth, to the Jew first, and to the Greke.
27938	45	1	17	For the riytwisnesse of God is schewid in it, of feith in to feith,
27939	45	1	18	as it is writun, For a iust man lyueth of feith. For the wraththe of God is schewid fro heuene on al vnpite and wickidnesse of tho men, that withholden the treuthe of God in vnriytwisnes.
27940	45	1	19	For that thing of God that is knowun, is schewid to hem, for God hath schewid to hem.
27941	45	1	20	For the vnuysible thingis of hym, that ben vndurstondun, ben biholdun of the creature of the world, bi tho thingis that ben maad, yhe, and the euerlastynge vertu of hym and the godhed, so that thei mowe not be excusid.
27942	45	1	21	For whanne thei hadden knowe God, thei glorifieden hym not as God, nether diden thankyngis; but thei vanyschiden in her thouyts, and the vnwise herte of hem was derkid.
27943	45	1	22	For thei `seiynge that hem silf weren wise, thei weren maad foolis.
27944	45	1	23	And thei chaungiden the glorie of `God vncorruptible in to the licnesse of an ymage of a deedli man, and of briddis, and of foure footid beestis, and of serpentis.
27945	45	1	24	For which thing God bitook hem in to the desiris of her herte, in to vnclennesse, that thei punysche with wrongis her bodies in hem silf.
27946	45	1	25	The whiche chaungiden the treuthe of God in to leesyng, and herieden and serueden a creature rathere than to the creatoure, that is blessid in to worldis of worldis.
27947	45	1	26	Amen. Therfor God bitook hem in to passiouns of schenschipe. For the wymmen of hem chaungiden the kyndli vss in to that vss that is ayens kynde.
27948	45	1	27	Also the men forsoken the kyndli vss of womman, and brenneden in her desiris togidere, and men in to men wrouyten filthehed, and resseyueden in to hem silf the meede that bihofte of her errour.
27949	45	1	28	And as thei preueden that thei hadden not God in knowyng, God bitook hem in to a repreuable wit, that thei do tho thingis that ben not couenable; that thei ben fulfillid with al wickidnesse,
27950	45	1	29	malice, fornycacioun, coueitise, weiwardnesse, ful of enuye, mansleyngis, strijf, gile, yuel wille, preuy bacbiteris, detractouris,
27951	45	1	30	hateful to God, debateris, proude, and hiy ouer mesure, fynderis of yuele thingis, not obeschynge to fadir and modir,
27952	45	1	31	vnwise, vnmanerli, withouten loue, withouten boond of pees, with outen merci.
27953	45	1	32	The whiche whanne thei hadden knowe the riytwisnesse of God, vndirstoden not, that thei that don siche thingis ben worthi the deth, not oneli thei that don tho thingis, but also thei that consenten to the doeris.
27954	45	2	1	Wherfor thou art vnexcusable, ech man that demest, for in what thing thou demest anothir man, thou condempnest thi silf; for thou doist the same thingis whiche thou demest.
27955	45	2	2	And we witen, that the doom of God is aftir treuthe ayens hem, that don siche thingis.
27956	45	2	3	But gessist thou, man, that demest hem that doen siche thingis, and thou doist tho thingis, that thou schalt ascape the doom of God?
27957	45	2	4	Whether `dispisist thou the richessis of his goodnesse, and the pacience, and the long abidyng? Knowist thou not, that the benygnyte of God ledith thee to forthenkyng?
27958	45	2	5	But aftir thin hardnesse and vnrepentaunt herte, thou tresorist to thee wraththe in the dai of wraththe and of schewyng of the riytful doom of God,
27959	45	2	6	that schal yelde to ech man aftir his werkis;
27960	45	2	7	sotheli to hem that ben bi pacience of good werk, glorie, and onour, and vncorrupcioun, to hem that seken euerlastynge lijf;
27961	45	2	8	but to hem that ben of strijf, and that assenten not to treuthe, but bileuen to wickidnesse, wraththe and indignacioun, tribulacioun and angwisch,
27962	45	2	9	in to ech soule of man that worchith yuel, to the Jew first, and to the Greke;
27963	45	2	10	but glorie, and honour, and pees, to ech man that worchith good thing, to the Jew first, and to the Greke.
27964	45	2	11	For accepcioun of persones is not anentis God.
27965	45	2	12	For who euere han synned without the lawe, schulen perische withouten the lawe; and who euere han synned in the lawe, thei schulen be demyd bi the lawe.
27966	45	2	13	For the hereris of lawe ben not iust anentis God, but the doeris of the lawe schulen be maad iust.
27967	45	2	14	For whanne hethene men that han not lawe, don kyndli tho thingis that ben of the lawe, thei not hauynge suche manere lawe, ben lawe to hem silf,
27968	45	2	15	that schewen the werk of the lawe writun in her hertis. For the conscience of hem yeldith to hem a witnessyng bytwixe hem silf of thouytis that ben accusynge or defendynge,
27969	45	2	16	in the dai whanne God schal deme the priuy thingis of men aftir my gospel, bi Jhesu Crist.
27970	45	2	17	But if thou art named a Jew, and restist in the lawe, and hast glorie in God,
27971	45	2	18	and hast knowe his wille, and thou lerud bi lawe preuest the more profitable thingis,
27972	45	2	19	and tristist thi silf to be a ledere of blynde men, the liyt of hem that ben in derknessis,
27973	45	2	20	a techere of vnwise men, a maistir of yonge children, that hast the foorme of kunnyng and of treuthe in the lawe;
27974	45	2	21	what thanne techist thou another, and techist not thi silf? Thou that prechist that me schal not stele, stelist?
27975	45	2	22	Thou that techist that me schal `do no letcherie, doist letcherie? Thou that wlatist maumetis, doist sacrilegie?
27976	45	2	23	Thou that hast glorie in the lawe, vnworschipist God bi brekyng of the lawe?
27977	45	2	24	For the name of God is blasfemed bi you among hethene men, as is writun.
27978	45	2	25	For circumcisioun profitith, if thou kepe the lawe; but if thou be a trespassour ayens the lawe, thi circumsicioun is maad prepucie.
27979	45	2	26	Therfor if prepucie kepe the riytwisnessis of the lawe, whethir his prepucie schal not be arettid in to circumcisioun?
27980	45	2	27	And the prepucie of kynde that fulfillith the lawe, schal deme thee, that bi lettre and circumcisioun art trespassour ayens the lawe.
27981	45	2	28	For he that is in opene is not a Jew, nether it is circumsicioun that is openli in the fleisch;
27982	45	2	29	but he that is a Jew in hid, and the circumcisioun of herte, in spirit, not bi the lettre, whos preisyng is not of men, but of God.
27983	45	3	1	What thanne is more to a Jew, or what profit of circumcisioun?
27984	45	3	2	Myche bi al wise; first, for the spekyngis of God `weren bitakun to hem.
27985	45	3	3	And what if summe of hem bileueden not? Whethir the vnbileue of hem hath auoidid the feith of God?
27986	45	3	4	God forbede. For God is sothefast, but ech man a liere; as it is writun, That thou be iustified in thi wordis, and ouercome, whanne thou art demed.
27987	45	3	5	But if oure wickidnesse comende the riytwisnesse of God, what shulen we seie? Whether God is wickid, that bryngith in wraththe?
27988	45	3	6	Aftir man Y seie. God forbede. Ellis hou schal God deme this world?
27989	45	3	7	For if the treuthe of God hath aboundid in my lessyng, in to the glorie of hym, what yit am Y demed as a synner?
27990	45	3	8	And not as we ben blasfemed, and as summen seien that we seien, Do we yuele thingis, that gode thingis come. Whos dampnacioun is iust.
27991	45	3	9	What thanne? Passen we hem? Nay; for we han schewid bi skile, that alle bothe Jewis and Grekis ben vndur synne,
27992	45	3	10	as it is writun, For ther is no man iust;
27993	45	3	11	ther is no man vndurstondynge, nethir sekynge God.
27994	45	3	12	Alle bowiden a wey, togidere thei ben maad vnprofitable; ther is noon that doith good thing, there is noon `til to oon.
27995	45	3	13	The throte of hem is an opyn sepulcre; with her tungis thei diden gilefuli; the venym of snakis is vndur her lippis.
27996	45	3	14	The mouth of whiche is ful of cursyng and bitternesse;
27997	45	3	15	the feet of hem ben swifte to schede blood.
27998	45	3	16	Sorewe and cursidnesse ben in the weies of hem, and thei knewen not the weie of pees;
27999	45	3	17	[]
28000	45	3	18	the drede of God is not bifor her iyen.
28001	45	3	19	And we witen, that what euere thingis the lawe spekith, it spekith to hem that ben in the lawe, that ech mouth be stoppid, and ech world be maad suget to God.
28002	45	3	20	For of the werkis of the lawe ech fleisch schal not be iustified bifor hym; for bi the lawe ther is knowyng of synne.
28003	45	3	21	But now with outen the lawe the riytwisnesse of God is schewid, that is witnessid of the lawe and the profetis.
28004	45	3	22	And the riytwisnesse of God is bi the feith of Jhesu Crist in to alle men and on alle men that bileuen in hym; for ther is no departyng.
28005	45	3	23	For alle men synneden, and han nede to the glorie of God;
28006	45	3	24	and ben iustified freli bi his grace, bi the ayenbiyng that is in `Crist Jhesu.
28007	45	3	25	Whom God ordeynede foryyuer, bi feith in his blood, to the schewyng of his riytwisnesse, for remyssioun of biforgoynge synnes,
28008	45	3	26	in the beryng up of God, to the schewyng of his riytwisnesse in this tyme, that he be iust, and iustifyynge hym that is of the feith of Jhesu Crist.
28009	45	3	27	Where thanne is thi gloriyng? It is excludid. Bi what lawe? Of dedis doyng? Nay, but by the lawe of feith.
28010	45	3	28	For we demen a man to be iustified bi the feith, with outen werkis of the lawe.
28011	45	3	29	Whethir of Jewis is God oneli? Whether he is not also of hethene men? Yhis, and of hethene men.
28012	45	3	30	For `oon God is, that iustefieth circumcisioun bi feith, and prepucie bi feith.
28013	45	3	31	Distruye we therfor the lawe bi the feith? God forbede; but we stablischen the lawe.
28014	45	4	1	What thanne schulen we seie, that Abraham oure fadir aftir the flesch foond?
28015	45	4	2	For if Abraham is iustified of werkis of the lawe, he hath glorie, but not anentis God.
28016	45	4	3	For what seith the scripture? Abraham bileued to God, and it was arettid to him to riytwisnesse.
28017	45	4	4	And to hym that worchith mede is not arettid bi grace, but bi dette.
28018	45	4	5	Sotheli to hym that worchith not, but bileueth in to hym that iustefieth a wickid man, his feith is arettid to riytwisnesse, aftir the purpos of Goddis grace.
28019	45	4	6	As Dauid seith the blessidnesse of a man, whom God acceptith, he yyueth to hym riytwisnesse with outen werkis of the lawe,
28020	45	4	7	Blessid ben thei, whos wickidnessis ben foryouun, and whos synnes ben hid.
28021	45	4	8	Blessid is that man, to whom God arettide not synne.
28022	45	4	9	Thanne whether dwellith this blisfulnesse oneli in circumcisioun, or also in prepucie? For we seien, that the feith was arettid to Abraham to riytwisnesse.
28023	45	4	10	Hou thanne was it arettid? in circumcisioun, or in prepucie? Not in circumcisioun, but in prepucie.
28024	45	4	11	And he took a signe of circumcisioun, a tokenyng of riytwisnesse of the feith which is in prepucie, that he be fadir of alle men bileuynge bi prepucie, that it be arettid also to hem to riytwisnesse;
28025	45	4	12	and that he be fadir of circumcisioun, not onely to hem that ben of circumcisioun, but also to hem that suen the steppis of the feith, which feith is in prepucie of oure fader Abraham.
28026	45	4	13	For not bi the lawe is biheest to Abraham, or to his seed, that he schulde be eir of the world, but bi the riytwisnesse of feith.
28027	45	4	14	For if thei that ben of the lawe, ben eiris, feith is distried, biheest is don awey.
28028	45	4	15	For the lawe worchith wraththe; for where is no lawe, there is no trespas, nethir is trespassyng.
28029	45	4	16	Therfor riytfulnesse is of the feith, that bi grace biheeste be stable to ech seed, not to that seed oneli that is of the lawe, but to that that is of the feith of Abraham, which is fadir of vs alle.
28030	45	4	17	As it is writun, For Y haue set thee fadir of many folkis, bifor God to whom thou hast bileued. Which God quykeneth deed men, and clepith tho thingis that ben not, as tho that ben.
28031	45	4	18	Which Abraham ayens hope bileuede in to hope, that he schulde be maad fader of many folkis, as it was seid to hym, Thus schal thi seed be, as the sterris of heuene, and as the grauel that is in the brenke of the see.
28032	45	4	19	And he was not maad vnstidfast in the bileue, nether he biheelde his bodi thanne nyy deed, whanne he was almost of an hundrid yeer, ne the wombe of Sare nyy deed.
28033	45	4	20	Also in the biheeste of God he doutide not with vntrist; but he was coumfortid in bileue,
28034	45	4	21	yyuynge glorie to God, witynge moost fulli that what euere thingis God hath bihiyt, he is myyti also to do.
28035	45	4	22	Therfor it was arettid to hym to riytwisnesse.
28036	45	4	23	And it is not writun oneli for him, that it was arettid to hym to riytwisnesse,
28037	45	4	24	but also for vs, to whiche it schal be arettid, that bileuen in him that reiside oure Lord Jhesu Crist fro deeth.
28038	45	4	25	Which was bitakun for oure synnes, and roos ayen for oure iustefiyng.
28039	45	5	1	Therfor we, iustified of feith, haue we pees at God bi oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
28040	45	5	2	Bi whom we han niy goyng to, bi feith in to this grace, in which we stonden, and han glorie in the hope of the glorie of Goddis children.
28041	45	5	3	And not this oneli, but also we glorien in tribulaciouns, witynge that tribulacioun worchith pacience,
28042	45	5	4	and pacience preuyng, and preuyng hope.
28043	45	5	5	And hope confoundith not, for the charite of God is spred abrood in oure hertis bi the Hooli Goost, that is youun to vs.
28044	45	5	6	And while that we weren sijk aftir the tyme, what diede Crist for wickid men?
28045	45	5	7	For vnnethis dieth ony man for the iust man; and yit for a good man perauenture summan dar die.
28046	45	5	8	But God comendith his charite in vs; for if whanne we weren yit synneris,
28047	45	5	9	aftir the tyme Crist was deed for vs, thanne myche more now we iustified in his blood, schulen be saaf fro wraththe bi him.
28048	45	5	10	For if whanne we weren enemyes, we ben recounselid to God bi the deth of his sone, myche more we recounselid schulen be saaf in the lijf of hym.
28049	45	5	11	And not oneli this, but also we glorien in God, bi oure Lord Jhesu Crist, bi whom we han resseyued now recounseling.
28050	45	5	12	Therfor as bi o man synne entride in to this world, and bi synne deth, and so deth passide forth in to alle men, in which man alle men synneden.
28051	45	5	13	For `til to the lawe synne was in the world; but synne was not rettid, whanne lawe was not.
28052	45	5	14	But deth regnyde from Adam `til to Moises, also in to hem that synneden not in licnesse of the trespassyng of Adam, the which is licnesse of Crist to comynge.
28053	45	5	15	But not as gilt, so the yifte; for if thorouy the gilt of oon manye ben deed, myche more the grace of God and the yifte in the grace of o man Jhesu Crist hath aboundid in to many men.
28054	45	5	16	And not as bi o synne, so bi the yifte; for the doom of oon in to condempnacioun, but grace of many giltis in to iustificacioun.
28055	45	5	17	For if in the gilt of oon deth regnede thorouy oon, myche more men that takyn plente of grace, and of yyuyng, and of riytwisnesse, schulen regne in lijf bi oon Jhesu Crist.
28056	45	5	18	Therfor as bi the gilt of oon in to alle men in to condempnacioun, so bi the riytwisnesse of oon in to alle men in to iustifiyng of lijf.
28057	45	5	19	For as bi inobedience of o man manye ben maad synneris, so bi the obedience of oon manye schulen be iust.
28058	45	5	20	And the lawe entride, that gilt schulde be plenteuouse; but where gilt was plenteuouse,
28059	45	5	21	grace was more plenteuouse. That as synne regnede in to deth, so grace regne bi riytwisnesse in to euerlastynge lijf, bi `Crist Jhesu oure Lord.
28060	45	6	1	Therfor what schulen we seie? Schulen we dwelle in synne, that grace be plenteuouse?
28061	45	6	2	God forbede. For hou schulen we that ben deed to synne, lyue yit ther ynne?
28062	45	6	3	Whether, britheren, ye knowen not, that whiche euere we ben baptisid in Crist Jhesu, we ben baptisid in his deth?
28063	45	6	4	For we ben togidere biried with hym bi baptym `in to deth; that as Crist aroos fro deth bi the glorie of the fadir, so walke we in a newnesse of lijf.
28064	45	6	5	For if we plauntid togidere ben maad to the licnesse of his deth, also we schulen be of the licnesse of his risyng ayen;
28065	45	6	6	witynge this thing, that oure olde man is crucified togidere, that the bodi of synne be distruyed, that we serue no more to synne.
28066	45	6	7	For he that is deed, is iustefied fro synne.
28067	45	6	8	And if we ben deed with Crist, we bileuen that also we schulen lyue togidere with hym;
28068	45	6	9	witinge for Crist, rysynge ayen fro deth, now dieth not, deeth schal no more haue lordschip on hym.
28069	45	6	10	For that he was deed to synne, he was deed onys; but that he lyueth, he liueth to God.
28070	45	6	11	So ye deme you silf to be deed to synne, but lyuynge to God in `Jhesu Crist oure Lord.
28071	45	6	12	Therfor regne not synne in youre deedli bodi, that ye obeische to hise coueityngis.
28072	45	6	13	Nether yyue ye youre membris armuris of wickidnesse to synne, but yyue ye you silf to God, as thei that lyuen of deed men, and youre membris armuris of riytwisnesse to God.
28073	45	6	14	For synne schal not haue lordschipe on you; for ye ben not vndur the lawe, but vndur grace.
28074	45	6	15	What therfor? Schulen we do synne, for we ben not vndur the lawe, but vndur grace?
28075	45	6	16	God forbede. Witen ye not, that to whom ye yyuen you seruauntis to obeie to, ye ben seruauntis of that thing, to which ye han obeschid, ether of synne to deth, ether of obedience to riytwisnesse?
28076	45	6	17	But Y thanke God, that ye weren seruauntis of synne; but ye han obeischid of herte in to that fourme of techyng, in which ye ben bitakun.
28077	45	6	18	And ye delyuered fro synne, ben maad seruauntis of riytwisnesse.
28078	45	6	19	Y seie that thing that is of man, for the vnstidefastnesse of youre fleisch. But as ye han youun youre membris to serue to vnclennesse, and to wickidnesse `in to wickidnesse, so now yyue ye youre membris to serue to riytwisnesse in to hoolynesse.
28079	45	6	20	For whanne ye weren seruauntis of synne, ye weren fre of riytfulnesse.
28080	45	6	21	Therfor what fruyt hadden ye thanne in tho thingis, in whiche ye schamen now? For the ende of hem is deth.
28081	45	6	22	But now ye delyuered fro synne, and maad seruauntis to God, han your fruyt in to holinesse, and the ende euerlastinge lijf. For the wagis of synne is deth; the grace of God is euerlastynge lijf in Crist Jhesu our Lord.
28082	45	7	1	Britheren, whethir ye knowun not; for Y speke to men `that knowen the lawe; for the lawe hath lordschip in a man, as long tyme as it lyueth?
28083	45	7	2	For that womman that is vndur an hosebonde, is boundun to the lawe, while the hosebonde lyueth; but if hir hosebonde is deed, sche is delyuered fro the lawe of the hosebonde.
28084	45	7	3	Therfor sche schal be clepid auoutresse, if sche be with another man, while the hosebonde lyueth; but if hir hosebonde is deed, sche is delyuered fro the lawe of the hosebonde, that sche be not auoutresse, if sche be with another man.
28085	45	7	4	And so, my britheren, ye ben maad deed to the lawe bi the bodi of Crist, that ye ben of another, that roos ayen fro deth, that ye bere fruyt to God.
28086	45	7	5	For whanne we weren in fleisch, passiouns of synnes, that weren bi the lawe, wrouyten in oure membris, to bere fruyt to deth.
28087	45	7	6	But now we ben vnboundun fro the lawe of deth, in which we weren holdun, so that we seruen in newnesse of spirit, and not in eldnesse of lettre.
28088	45	7	7	What therfor schulen we seie? The lawe is synne? God forbede. But Y knew not synne, but bi lawe; for Y wiste not that coueitynge was synne, but for the lawe seide, Thou schalt not coueyte.
28089	45	7	8	And thoruy occasioun takun, synne bi the maundement hath wrouyt in me al coueytise; for withouten the lawe, synne was deed.
28090	45	7	9	And Y lyuede withouten the lawe sumtyme; but whanne the comaundement was comun, synne lyuede ayen.
28091	45	7	10	But Y was deed, and this comaundement that was to lijf, was foundun to me, to be to deth.
28092	45	7	11	For synne, thorouy occasioun takun bi the comaundement, disceyuede me, and bi that it slow me.
28093	45	7	12	Therfor the lawe is hooli, and the comaundement is hooli, and iust, and good.
28094	45	7	13	Is thanne that thing that is good, maad deth to me? God forbede. But synne, that it seme synne, thorouy good thing wrouyte deth to me, that me synne ouer maner thorouy the comaundement.
28095	45	7	14	And we witen, that the lawe is spiritual; but Y am fleischli, seld vndur synne.
28096	45	7	15	For Y vndurstonde not that that Y worche; for Y do not the good thing that Y wole, but Y do thilke yuel thing that Y hate.
28097	45	7	16	And if Y do that thing that Y wole not, Y consente to the lawe, that it is good.
28098	45	7	17	But now Y worche not it now, but the synne that dwellith in me.
28099	45	7	18	But and Y woot, that in me, that is, in my fleisch, dwellith no good; for wille lieth to me, but Y fynde not to performe good thing.
28100	45	7	19	For Y do not thilke good thing that Y wole, but Y do thilke yuel thing that Y wole not.
28101	45	7	20	And if Y do that yuel thing that Y wole not, Y worche not it, but the synne that dwellith in me.
28102	45	7	21	Therfor Y fynde the lawe to me willynge to do good thing, for yuel thing lieth to me.
28103	45	7	22	For Y delite togidere to the lawe of God, aftir the ynnere man. But Y se another lawe in my membris,
28104	45	7	23	ayenfiytynge the lawe of my soule, and makynge me caitif in the lawe of synne, that is in my membris.
28105	45	7	24	Y am an vnceli man; who schal delyuer me fro the bodi of this synne?
28106	45	7	25	The grace of God, bi Jhesu Crist oure Lord. Therfor Y my silf bi the soule serue to the lawe of God; but bi fleisch to the lawe of synne.
28107	45	8	1	Therfor now no thing of dampnacioun is to hem that ben in Crist Jhesu, whiche wandren not after the flesch.
28108	45	8	2	For the lawe of the spirit of lijf in Crist Jhesu hath delyuerid me fro the lawe of synne, and of deth.
28109	45	8	3	For that that was vnpossible to the lawe, in what thing it was sijk bi flesch, God sente his sone in to the licknesse of fleisch of synne, and of synne dampnede synne in fleisch;
28110	45	8	4	that the iustefiyng of the lawe were fulfillid in vs, that goen not aftir the fleisch, but aftir the spirit.
28111	45	8	5	For thei that ben aftir the fleisch, saueren tho thingis that ben of the fleisch; but thei that ben after the spirit, feelen tho thingis that ben of the spirit. For the prudence of fleisch is deth;
28112	45	8	6	but the prudence of spirit is lijf and pees.
28113	45	8	7	For the wisdom of the fleisch is enemye to God; for it is not suget to the lawe of God, for nether it may.
28114	45	8	8	And thei that ben in fleisch, moun not plese to God.
28115	45	8	9	But ye ben not in fleisch, but in spirit; if netheles the spirit of God dwellith in you. But if ony hath not the spirit of Crist, this is not his.
28116	45	8	10	For if Crist is in you, the bodi is deed for synne, but the spirit lyueth for iustefiyng.
28117	45	8	11	And if the spirit of hym that reiside Jhesu Crist fro deth dwellith in you, he that reiside Jhesu Crist fro deth, shal quykene also youre deedli bodies, for the spirit of hym that dwellith in you.
28118	45	8	12	Therfor, britheren, we ben dettouris, not to the flesch, that we lyuen aftir the flesch.
28119	45	8	13	For if ye lyuen aftir the fleisch, ye schulen die; but if ye bi the spirit sleen the dedis of the fleisch, ye schulen lyue.
28120	45	8	14	For who euere ben led bi the spirit of God, these ben the sones of God.
28121	45	8	15	For ye han not take eftsoone the spirit of seruage in drede, but ye han taken the spirit of adopcioun of sones, in which we crien, Abba, fadir.
28122	45	8	16	And the ilke spirit yeldith witnessyng to oure spirit, that we ben the sones of God;
28123	45	8	17	if sones, and eiris, `and eiris of God, and eiris togidere with Crist; if netheles we suffren togidere, that also we ben glorified togidere.
28124	45	8	18	And Y deme, that the passiouns of this tyme ben not worthi to the glorie to comynge, that schal be schewid in vs.
28125	45	8	19	For the abidyng of creature abidith the schewyng of the sones of God.
28126	45	8	20	But the creature is suget to vanyte, not willynge, but for hym that made it suget in hope;
28127	45	8	21	for the ilke creature schal be delyuered fro seruage of corrupcioun in to liberte of the glorie of the sones of God.
28128	45	8	22	And we witen, that ech creature sorewith, and trauelith with peyne til yit.
28129	45	8	23	And not oneli it, but also we vs silf, that han the first fruytis of the spirit, and we vs silf sorewen with ynne vs for the adopcioun of Goddis sonys, abidynge the ayenbiyng of oure bodi.
28130	45	8	24	But bi hope we ben maad saaf. For hope that is seyn, is not hope; for who hopith that thing, that he seeth?
28131	45	8	25	And if we hopen that thing that we seen not, we abiden bi pacience.
28132	45	8	26	And also the spirit helpith oure infirmyte; for what we schulen preie, as it bihoueth, we witen not, but the ilke spirit axith for vs with sorewyngis, that moun not be teld out.
28133	45	8	27	For he that sekith the hertis, woot what the spirit desirith, for bi God he axith for hooli men.
28134	45	8	28	And we witen, that to men `that louen God, alle thingis worchen togidere in to good, to hem that aftir purpos ben clepid seyntis.
28135	45	8	29	For thilke that he knewe bifor, he bifor ordenede bi grace to be maad lijk to the ymage of his sone, that he be the first bigetun among many britheren.
28136	45	8	30	And thilke that he bifore ordeynede to blis, hem he clepide; and whiche he clepide, hem he iustifiede; and whiche he iustifiede, and hem he glorifiede.
28137	45	8	31	What thanne schulen we seie to these thingis? If God for vs, who is ayens vs?
28138	45	8	32	The which also sparide not his owne sone, but `for vs alle bitook hym, hou also yaf he not to vs alle thingis with hym?
28139	45	8	33	Who schal accuse ayens the chosun men of God? It is God that iustifieth,
28140	45	8	34	who is it that condempneth? It is Jhesus Crist that was deed, yhe, the which roos ayen, the which is on the riyt half of God, and the which preieth for vs.
28141	45	8	35	Who thanne schal departe vs fro the charite of Crist? tribulacioun, or anguysch, or hungur, or nakidnesse, or persecucioun, or perel, or swerd?
28142	45	8	36	As it is writun, For we ben slayn al dai for thee; we ben gessid as scheep of slauytir.
28143	45	8	37	But in alle these thingis we ouercomen, for hym that louyde vs.
28144	45	8	38	But Y am certeyn, that nethir deeth, nether lijf, nether aungels, nethir principatus, nether vertues, nether present thingis, nether thingis to comynge, nether strengthe,
28145	45	8	39	nether heiyth, nether depnesse, nether noon othir creature may departe vs fro the charite of God, that is in `Crist Jhesu oure Lord.
28146	45	9	1	I seie treuthe in Crist Jhesu, Y lye not, for my conscience berith witnessyng to me in the Hooli Goost,
28147	45	9	2	for greet heuynesse is to me, and contynuel sorewe to my herte.
28148	45	9	3	For Y my silf desiride to be departid fro Crist for my britheren, that ben my cosyns aftir the fleisch, that ben men of Israel;
28149	45	9	4	whos is adopcioun of sones, and glorie, and testament, and yyuyng of the lawe, and seruyce, and biheestis;
28150	45	9	5	whos ben the fadris, and of which is Crist after the fleisch, that is God aboue alle thingis, blessid in to worldis.
28151	45	9	6	Amen. But not that the word of God hath falle doun. For not alle that ben of Israel, these ben Israelitis.
28152	45	9	7	Nethir thei that ben seed of Abraham, `alle ben sonys; but in Ysaac the seed schal be clepid to thee;
28153	45	9	8	that is to seie, not thei that ben sones of the fleisch, ben sones of God, but thei that ben sones of biheeste ben demed in the seed.
28154	45	9	9	For whi this is the word of biheest, Aftir this tyme Y schal come, and a sone schal be to Sare.
28155	45	9	10	And not oneli sche, but also Rebecca hadde twey sones of o liggyng bi of Ysaac, oure fadir.
28156	45	9	11	And whanne thei weren not yit borun, nether hadden don ony thing of good ether of yuel, that the purpos of God schulde dwelle bi eleccioun,
28157	45	9	12	not of werkis, but of God clepynge, it was seid to hym,
28158	45	9	13	that the more schulde serue the lesse, as it is writun, Y louede Jacob, but Y hatide Esau.
28159	45	9	14	What therfor schulen we seie? Whether wickidnesse be anentis God?
28160	45	9	15	God forbede. For he seith to Moyses, Y schal haue merci on whom Y haue merci; and Y schal yyue merci on whom Y schal haue merci.
28161	45	9	16	Therfor it is not nether of man willynge, nethir rennynge, but of God hauynge mercy.
28162	45	9	17	And the scripture seith to Farao, For to this thing Y haue stirid thee, that Y schewe in thee my vertu, and that my name be teld in al erthe.
28163	45	9	18	Therfor of whom God wole, he hath merci; and whom he wole, he endurith.
28164	45	9	19	Thanne seist thou to me, What is souyt yit? for who withstondith his wille?
28165	45	9	20	O! man, who art thou, that answerist to God? Whether a maad thing seith to hym that made it, What hast thou maad me so?
28166	45	9	21	Whether a potter of cley hath not power to make of the same gobet o vessel in to honour, an othere in to dispit?
28167	45	9	22	That if God willynge to schewe his wraththe, and to make his power knowun, hath suffrid in greet pacience vessels of wraththe able in to deth,
28168	45	9	23	to schewe the riytchessis of his glorie in to vessels of merci, whiche he made redi in to glorie.
28169	45	9	24	Whiche also he clepide not oneli of Jewis, but also of hethene men, as he seith in Osee,
28170	45	9	25	Y schal clepe not my puple my puple, and not my loued my louyd, and not getynge mercy getynge merci;
28171	45	9	26	and it schal be in the place, where it is seid to hem, Not ye my puple, there thei schulen be clepid the sones of `God lyuynge.
28172	45	9	27	But Isaye crieth for Israel, If the noumbre of Israel schal be as grauel of the see, the relifs schulen be maad saaf.
28173	45	9	28	Forsothe a word makynge an ende, and abreggynge in equyte, for the Lord schal make a word breggid on al the erthe.
28174	45	9	29	And as Ysaye bifor seide, But God of oostis hadde left to vs seed, we hadden be maad as Sodom, and we hadden be lijk as Gommor.
28175	45	9	30	Therfor what schulen we seie? That hethene men that sueden not riytwisnesse, han gete riytwisnesse, yhe, the riytwisnesse that is of feith.
28176	45	9	31	But Israel suynge the lawe of riytwisnesse, cam not parfitli in to the lawe of riytwisnesse.
28177	45	9	32	Whi? For not of feith, but as of werkys. And thei spurneden ayens the stoon of offencioun,
28178	45	9	33	as it is writun, Lo! Y putte a stoon of offensioun in Syon, and a stoon of sclaundre; and ech that schal bileue `in it, schal not be confoundid.
28179	45	10	1	Britheren, the wille of myn herte and mi biseching is maad to God for hem in to helthe.
28180	45	10	2	But Y bere witnessyng to hem, that thei han loue of God, but not aftir kunnyng.
28181	45	10	3	For thei vnknowynge Goddis riytwisnesse, and sekynge to make stidefast her owne riytfulnesse, ben not suget to the riytwisnesse of God.
28182	45	10	4	For the ende of the lawe is Crist, to riytwisnesse to ech man that bileueth.
28183	45	10	5	For Moises wroot, For the man that schal do riytwisnesse that is of the lawe, schal lyue in it.
28184	45	10	6	But the riytwisnesse that is of bileue, seith thus, Seie thou not in thin herte, Who schal stie in to heuene? that is to seie, to lede doun Crist;
28185	45	10	7	or who schal go doun in to helle? that is, to ayenclepe Crist fro deth.
28186	45	10	8	But what seith the scripture? The word is nyy in thi mouth, and in thin herte; this is the word of bileue, which we prechen.
28187	45	10	9	That if thou knoulechist in thi mouth the Lord Jhesu Crist, and bileuest in thin herte, that God reiside hym fro deth, thou schalt be saaf.
28188	45	10	10	For bi herte me bileueth to riytwisnesse, but bi mouth knowleching is maad to helthe.
28189	45	10	11	For whi the scripture seith, Ech that bileueth in hym, schal not be confoundid.
28190	45	10	12	And ther is no distinccioun of Jew and of Greke; for the same Lord of alle is riche in alle, that inwardli clepen hym.
28191	45	10	13	For ech man `who euere schal inwardli clepe the name of the Lord, schal be saaf.
28192	45	10	14	Hou thanne schulen thei inwardli clepe hym, in to whom thei han not bileued? or hou schulen thei bileue to hym, whom thei han not herd? Hou schulen thei here, with outen a prechour?
28193	45	10	15	and hou schulen thei preche, but thei be sent? As it is writun, Hou faire ben the feet of hem that prechen pees, of hem that prechen good thingis.
28194	45	10	16	But not alle men obeien to the gospel. For Ysaie seith, Lord, who bileuede to oure heryng?
28195	45	10	17	Therfor feith is of heryng, but heryng bi the word of Crist.
28196	45	10	18	But Y seie, Whether thei herden not? Yhis, sothely the word of hem wente out in to al the erthe, and her wordis in to the endis of the world.
28197	45	10	19	But Y seie, Whether Israel knewe not? First Moyses seith, Y schal lede you to enuye, that ye ben no folc; that ye ben an vnwise folc, Y schal sende you in to wraththe.
28198	45	10	20	And Ysaie is bold, and seith, Y am foundun of men that seken me not; opynli Y apperide to hem, that axiden not me.
28199	45	10	21	But to Israel he seith, Al dai Y streiyte out myn hondis to a puple that bileuede not, but ayen seide me.
28200	45	11	1	Therfor Y seie, Whether God hath put awei his puple? God forbede. For Y am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the lynage of Beniamyn.
28201	45	11	2	God hath not put awei his puple, which he bifor knew. Whether ye witen not, what the scripture seith in Elie? Hou he preieth God ayens Israel,
28202	45	11	3	Lord, thei han slayn thi prophetis, thei han vndurdoluun thin auteris, and Y am lefte aloone, and thei seken my lijf.
28203	45	11	4	But what seith Goddis answere to hym? Y haue left to me seuene thousyndes of men, that han not bowid her knees bifore Baal.
28204	45	11	5	So therfor also in this tyme, the relifs ben maad saaf, bi the chesyng of the grace of God.
28205	45	11	6	And if it be bi the grace of God, it is not now of werkis; ellis grace is not now grace.
28206	45	11	7	What thanne? Israel hath not getun this that he souyte, but eleccioun hath getun; and the othere ben blyndid.
28207	45	11	8	As it is writun, God yaf to hem a spirit of compunccioun, iyen that thei se not, and eeris, that thei here not, in to this dai.
28208	45	11	9	And Dauith seith, Be the boord of hem maad in to a gryn bifor hem, and in to catchyng, and in to sclaundre, and in to yeldyng to hem.
28209	45	11	10	Be the iyen of hem maad derk, that thei se not; and bowe thou doun algatis the bak of hem.
28210	45	11	11	Therfor Y seie, Whether thei offendiden so, that thei schulden falle doun? God forbede. But bi the gilt of hem helthe is maad to hethene men, that thei sue hem.
28211	45	11	12	That if the gilt of hem ben richessis of the world, and the makyng lesse of hem ben richessis of hethene men, hou myche more the plente of hem?
28212	45	11	13	But Y seie to you, hethene men, for as longe as Y am apostle of hethene men, Y schal onoure my mynysterie,
28213	45	11	14	if in ony maner Y stire my fleisch for to folowe, and that Y make summe of hem saaf.
28214	45	11	15	For if the loss of hem is the recouncelyng of the world, what is the takyng vp, but lijf of deede men?
28215	45	11	16	For if a litil part of that that is tastid be hooli, the hool gobet is hooli; and if the roote is hooli, also the braunchis.
28216	45	11	17	What if ony of the braunchis ben brokun, whanne thou were a wielde olyue tre, art graffid among hem, and art maad felowe of the roote, and of the fatnesse of the olyue tre,
28217	45	11	18	nyle thou haue glorie ayens the braunchis. For if thou gloriest, thou berist not the roote, but the roote thee.
28218	45	11	19	Therfor thou seist, The braunchis ben brokun, that Y be graffid in.
28219	45	11	20	Wel, for vnbileue the braunchis ben brokun; but thou stondist bi feith. Nyle thou sauere hiye thing,
28220	45	11	21	but drede thou, for if God sparide not the kyndli braunchis, lest perauenture he spare not thee.
28221	45	11	22	Therfor se the goodnesse, and the fersnesse of God; yhe, the feersnesse in to hem that felden doun, but the goodnesse of God in to thee, if thou dwellist in goodnesse, ellis also thou schalt be kit doun.
28222	45	11	23	Yhe, and thei schulen be set yn, if thei dwellen not in vnbileue. For God is myyti, to sette hem in eftsoone.
28223	45	11	24	For if thou art kit doun of the kyndeli wielde olyue tre, and ayens kynd art set in to a good olyue tre, hou myche more thei that ben bi kynde, schulen be set in her olyue tree?
28224	45	11	25	But, britheren, Y wole not that ye vnknowen this mysterie, that ye be not wise to you silf; for blyndenesse hath feld a parti in Israel, til that the plente of hethene men entride,
28225	45	11	26	and so al Israel schulde be maad saaf. As it is writun, He schal come of Syon, that schal delyuere, and turne awei the wickidnesse of Jacob.
28226	45	11	27	And this testament to hem of me, whanne Y schal do awei her synnes.
28227	45	11	28	Aftir the gospel thei ben enemyes for you, but thei ben moost dereworthe bi the eleccioun for the fadris.
28228	45	11	29	And the yiftis and the cleping of God ben with outen forthenkyng.
28229	45	11	30	And as sum tyme also ye bileueden not to God, but now ye han gete mercy for the vnbileue of hem;
28230	45	11	31	so and these now bileueden not in to youre merci, that also thei geten merci.
28231	45	11	32	For God closide alle thingis togidere in vnbileue, that he haue mercy on alle.
28232	45	11	33	O! the heiynesse of the ritchessis of the wisdom and of the kunnyng of God; hou incomprehensible ben hise domes, and hise weies ben vnserchable.
28233	45	11	34	For whi who knew the wit of the Lord, or who was his counselour? or who formere yaf to hym,
28234	45	11	35	and it schal be quyt to hym?
28235	45	11	36	For of hym, and bi hym, and in hym ben alle thingis. To hym be glorie in to worldis. Amen.
28236	45	12	1	Therfore, britheren, Y biseche you bi the mercy of God, that ye yyue youre bodies a lyuynge sacrifice, hooli, plesynge to God, and youre seruyse resonable.
28237	45	12	2	And nyle ye be confourmyd to this world, but be ye reformed in newnesse of youre wit, that ye preue which is the wille of God, good, and wel plesynge, and parfit.
28238	45	12	3	For Y seie, bi the grace that is youun to me, to alle that ben among you, that ye sauere no more than it bihoueth to sauere, but for to sauere to sobrenesse; and to ech man, as God hath departid the mesure of feith.
28239	45	12	4	For as in o bodi we han many membris, but alle the membris han not the same dede;
28240	45	12	5	so we many ben o bodi in Crist, and eche ben membris oon of anothir.
28241	45	12	6	Therfor we that han yiftis dyuersynge, aftir the grace that is youun to vs,
28242	45	12	7	ethir prophecie, aftir the resoun of feith; ethir seruise, in mynystryng; ether he that techith, in techyng;
28243	45	12	8	he that stirith softli, in monestyng; he that yyueth, in symplenesse; he that is souereyn, in bisynesse; he that hath merci, in gladnesse.
28244	45	12	9	Loue with outen feynyng, hatynge yuel, drawynge to good;
28245	45	12	10	louynge togidere the charite of britherhod. Eche come bifore to worschipen othere;
28246	45	12	11	not slow in bisynesse, feruent in spirit, seruynge to the Lord,
28247	45	12	12	ioiynge in hope, pacient in tribulacioun, bisy in preier,
28248	45	12	13	yyuynge good to the nedis of seyntis, kepynge hospitalite.
28249	45	12	14	Blesse ye men that pursuen you; blesse ye, and nyle ye curse;
28250	45	12	15	for to ioye with men that ioyen, for to wepe with men that wepen.
28251	45	12	16	Fele ye the same thing togidere; not sauerynge heiy thingis, but consentynge to meke thingis. Nile ye be prudent anentis you silf;
28252	45	12	17	to no man yeldynge yuel for yuel, but purueye ye good thingis, not oneli bifor God, but also bifor alle men.
28253	45	12	18	If it may be don, that that is of you, haue ye pees with alle men.
28254	45	12	19	Ye moost dere britheren, not defendynge you silf, but yyue ye place to wraththe; for it is writun, The Lord seith, To me veniaunce, and Y schal yelde.
28255	45	12	20	But if thin enemy hungrith, fede thou hym; if he thirstith, yyue thou drynke to hym; for thou doynge this thing schalt gidere togidere colis on his heed.
28256	45	12	21	Nyle thou be ouercomun of yuel, but ouercome thou yuel bi good.
28257	45	13	1	Euery soule be suget to heiyere powers. For ther is no power but of God, and tho thingis that ben of God, ben ordeyned.
28258	45	13	2	Therfor he that ayenstondith power, ayenstondith the ordynaunce of God; and thei that ayenstonden, geten to hem silf dampnacioun.
28259	45	13	3	For princes ben not to the drede of good work, but of yuel. But wilt thou, that thou drede not power? Do thou good thing, and thou schalt haue preisyng of it;
28260	45	13	4	for he is the mynystre of God to thee in to good. But if thou doist yuel, drede thou; for not with outen cause he berith the swerd, for he is the mynystre of God, vengere in to wraththe to hym that doith yuel.
28261	45	13	5	And therfor bi nede be ye suget, not oneli for wraththe, but also for conscience.
28262	45	13	6	For therfor ye yyuen tributis, thei ben the mynystris of God, and seruen for this same thing.
28263	45	13	7	Therfor yelde ye to alle men dettis, to whom tribut, tribut, to whom tol, tol, to whom drede, drede, to whom onour, onour.
28264	45	13	8	To no man owe ye ony thing, but that ye loue togidere. For he that loueth his neiybore, hath fulfillid the lawe.
28265	45	13	9	For, Thou schalt do no letcherie, Thou schalt not sle, Thou schalt not stele, Thou schalt not seie fals witnessyng, Thou schalt not coueyte the thing of thi neiybore, and if ther be ony othere maundement, it is instorid in this word, Thou schalt loue thi neiybore as thi silf.
28266	45	13	10	The loue of neiybore worchith not yuel; therfor loue is the fulfillyng of the lawe.
28267	45	13	11	And we knowen this tyme, that the our is now, that we rise fro sleep; for now oure heelthe is neer, than whanne we bileueden.
28268	45	13	12	The nyyt wente bifore, but the dai hath neiyed. Therfor caste we awei the werkis of derknessis, and be we clothid in the armeris of liyt.
28269	45	13	13	As in dai wandre we onestli, not in superflu feestis and drunkenessis, not in beddis and vnchastitees, not in strijf and in enuye;
28270	45	13	14	but be ye clothid in the Lord Jhesu Crist, and do ye not the bisynesse of fleisch in desiris.
28271	45	14	1	But take ye a sijk man in bileue, not in demyngis of thouytis.
28272	45	14	2	For another man leueth, that he mai ete alle thingis; but he that is sijk, ete wortis.
28273	45	14	3	He that etith, dispise not hym that etith not; and he that etith not, deme not hym that etith. For God hath take him to hym.
28274	45	14	4	Who art thou, that demest anothris seruaunt? To his lord he stondith, or fallith fro hym. But he schal stonde; for the Lord is myyti to make hym parfit.
28275	45	14	5	For whi oon demeth a day bitwixe a dai, another demeth ech dai.
28276	45	14	6	Ech man encrees in his wit. He that vnderstondith the dai, vnderstondith to the Lord. And he that etith, etith to the Lord, for he doith thankyngis to God. And he that etith not, etith not to the Lord, and doith thankyngis to God.
28277	45	14	7	For no man of vs lyueth to hymsilf, and no man dieth to hymself.
28278	45	14	8	For whether we lyuen, we lyuen to the Lord; and whethir we dien, we dien to the Lord. Therfor whethir we lyuen or dien, we ben of the Lord.
28279	45	14	9	For whi for this thing Crist was deed, and roos ayen, that he be Lord bothe of quyke and of deed men.
28280	45	14	10	But what demest thou thi brothir? or whi dispisist thou thi brothir? for alle we schulen stonde bifore the trone of Crist.
28281	45	14	11	For it is writun, Y lyue, seith the Lord, for to me ech kne schal be bowid, and ech tunge schal knouleche to God.
28282	45	14	12	Therfor ech of vs schal yelde resoun to God for hym silf.
28283	45	14	13	Therfor `no more deme we ech other; but more deme ye this thing, that ye putte not hirtyng, or sclaundre, to a brothir.
28284	45	14	14	I woot and triste in the Lord Jhesu, that no thing is vnclene bi hym, no but to him that demeth ony thing to be vnclene, to him it is vnclene.
28285	45	14	15	And if thi brother be maad sori in conscience for mete, now thou walkist not aftir charite. Nyle thou thorouy thi mete lese hym, for whom Crist diede.
28286	45	14	16	Therfor be not oure good thing blasfemed.
28287	45	14	17	For whi the rewme of God is not mete and drynk, but riytwisnesse and pees and ioye in the Hooli Goost.
28288	45	14	18	And he that in this thing serueth Crist, plesith God, and is proued to men.
28289	45	14	19	Therfor sue we tho thingis that ben of pees, and kepe we togidere `tho thingis that ben of edificacioun.
28290	45	14	20	Nyle thou for mete distrie the werk of God. For alle thingis ben clene, but it is yuel to the man that etith bi offendyng.
28291	45	14	21	It is good to not ete fleisch, and to not drynke wyn, nethir in what thing thi brother offendith, or is sclaundrid, or is maad sijk.
28292	45	14	22	Thou hast feith anentis thi silf, haue thou bifore God. Blessid is he that demeth not hym silf in that thing that he preueth.
28293	45	14	23	For he that demeth, is dampned, if he etith; for it is not of feith. And al thing that is not of feith, is synne.
28294	45	15	1	But we saddere men owen to susteyne the feblenesses of sijke men, and not plese to vs silf.
28295	45	15	2	Eche of vs plese to his neiybore in good, to edificacioun.
28296	45	15	3	For Crist pleside not to hym silf, as it is writun, The repreues of men dispisynge thee, felden on me.
28297	45	15	4	For what euere thingis ben writun, tho ben writun to oure techynge, that bi pacience and coumfort of scripturis we haue hope.
28298	45	15	5	But God of pacience and of solace yyue to you to vndurstonde the same thing, ech in to othere aftir Jhesu Crist,
28299	45	15	6	that ye of o wille with o mouth worschipe God and the fadir of oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
28300	45	15	7	For which thing take ye togidere, as also Crist took you in to the onour of God.
28301	45	15	8	For Y seie, that Jhesu Crist was a mynystre of circumcisioun for the treuthe of God, to conferme the biheestis of fadris.
28302	45	15	9	And hethene men owen to onoure God for merci; as it is writun, Therfor, Lord, Y schal knowleche to thee among hethene men, and Y schal synge to thi name.
28303	45	15	10	And eft he seith, Ye hethene men, be ye glad with his puple.
28304	45	15	11	And eft, Alle hethene men, herie ye the Lord; and alle puplis, magnefie ye hym.
28305	45	15	12	And eft Isaie seith, Ther schal be a roote of Jesse, that schal rise vp to gouerne hethene men, and hethene men schulen hope in hym.
28306	45	15	13	And God of hope fulfille you in al ioye and pees in bileuynge, that ye encrees in hope and vertu of the Hooli Goost.
28307	45	15	14	And, britheren, Y my silf am certeyn of you, that also ye ben ful of loue, and ye ben fillid with al kunnyng, so that ye moun moneste ech other.
28308	45	15	15	And, britheren, more boldli Y wroot to you a parti, as bryngynge you in to mynde, for the grace that is youun to me of God,
28309	45	15	16	that Y be the mynystre of Crist Jhesu among hethene men. And Y halewe the gospel of God, that the offryng of hethene men be acceptid, and halewid in the Hooli Goost.
28310	45	15	17	Therfor Y haue glorie in Crist Jhesu to God.
28311	45	15	18	For Y dar not speke ony thing of tho thingis, whiche Crist doith not bi me, in to obedience of hethene men, in word and dedis,
28312	45	15	19	in vertu of tokenes and grete wondris, in vertu of the Hooli Goost, so that fro Jerusalem bi cumpas to the Illirik see Y haue fillid the gospel of Crist.
28313	45	15	20	And so Y haue prechid this gospel, not where Crist was named, lest Y bilde vpon anotheres ground, but as it is writun,
28314	45	15	21	For to whom it is not teld of him, thei schulen se, and thei that herden not, schulen vndurstonde.
28315	45	15	22	For which thing Y was lettid ful myche to come to you, and Y am lettid to this tyme.
28316	45	15	23	And now Y haue not ferthere place in these cuntrees, but Y haue desire to come to you, of many yeris that ben passid.
28317	45	15	24	Whanne Y bygynne to passe in to Spayne, Y hope that in my goyng Y schal se you, and of you Y schal be led thidur, if Y vse you first in parti.
28318	45	15	25	Therfor now Y schal passe forth to Jerusalem, to mynystre to seyntis.
28319	45	15	26	For Macedonye and Acaie han assaied to make sum yifte to pore men of seyntis, that ben in Jerusalem.
28320	45	15	27	For it pleside to hem, and thei ben dettouris of hem; for hethene men ben maad parteneris of her goostli thingis, thei owen also in fleischli thingis to mynystre to hem.
28321	45	15	28	Therfor whanne Y haue endid this thing, and haue asigned to hem this fruyt, Y schal passe bi you in to Spayne.
28322	45	15	29	And Y woot, that Y comynge to you, schal come `in to the abundaunce of the blessing of Crist.
28323	45	15	30	Therfor, britheren, Y biseche you bi oure Lord Jhesu Crist, and bi charite of the Hooli Goost, that ye helpe me in youre preyeris to the Lord,
28324	45	15	31	that Y be delyuerid fro the vnfeithful men, that ben in Judee, and that the offryng of my seruyce be acceptid in Jerusalem to seyntis;
28325	45	15	32	that Y come to you in ioye, bi the wille of God, and that Y be refreischid with you. And God of pees be with you alle. Amen.
28326	45	16	1	And Y comende to you Feben, oure sister, which is in the seruyce of the chirche that is at Teucris,
28327	45	16	2	that ye resseyue hir in the Lord worthili to seyntis, and `that ye helpe hir in what euere cause sche schal nede of you. For sche helpide many men, and my silf.
28328	45	16	3	Grete ye Prisca and Aquyla, myn helperis in Crist Jhesu,
28329	45	16	4	which vndurputtiden her neckis for my lijf; to whiche not Y aloone do thankyngis, but also alle the chirchis of hethene men.
28330	45	16	5	And grete ye wel her meyneal chirche. Grete wel Efenete, louyd to me, that is the firste of Asie in Crist Jhesu.
28331	45	16	6	Grete wel Marie, the whiche hath trauelid myche in vs.
28332	45	16	7	Grete wel Andronyk and Julian, my cosyns, and myn euen prisouneris, which ben noble among the apostlis, and whiche weren bifor me in Crist.
28333	45	16	8	Grete wel Ampliate, most dereworth to me in the Lord.
28334	45	16	9	Grete wel Vrban, oure helpere in Crist Jhesus, and Stacchen, my derlyng.
28335	45	16	10	Grete wel Appellem, the noble in Crist.
28336	45	16	11	Grete wel hem that ben of Aristoblis hous. Grete wel Erodion, my cosyn. Grete wel hem that ben of Narciscies hous, that ben in the Lord.
28337	45	16	12	Grete wel Trifenam and Trifosam, whiche wymmen trauelen in the Lord. Grete wel Persida, most dereworthe womman, that hath trauelid myche in the Lord.
28338	45	16	13	Grete wel Rufus, chosun in the Lord, and his modir, and myn.
28339	45	16	14	Grete wel Ansicrete, Flegoncia, Hermen, Patroban, Herman, and britheren that ben with hem.
28340	45	16	15	Grete wel Filologus, and Julian, and Nereum, and his sistir, and Olympiades, and alle the seyntis that ben with hem.
28341	45	16	16	Grete ye wel togidere in hooli coss. Alle the chirches of Crist greten you wel.
28342	45	16	17	But, britheren, Y preye you, that ye aspie hem that maken discenciouns and hirtyngis, bisidis the doctryne that ye han lerned, and bowe ye awei fro hem.
28343	45	16	18	For suche men seruen not to the Lord Crist, but to her wombe, and bi swete wordis and blessyngis disseyuen the hertis of innocent men.
28344	45	16	19	But youre obedience is pupplischid in to euery place, therfor Y haue ioye in you. But Y wole that ye be wise in good thing, and symple in yuel.
28345	45	16	20	And God of pees tredde Sathanas vndur youre feet swiftli. The grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist be with you.
28346	45	16	21	Tymothe, myn helpere, gretith you wel, and also Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my cosyns.
28347	45	16	22	Y Tercius grete you wel, that wroot this epistle, in the Lord.
28348	45	16	23	Gayus, myn oost, gretith you wel, and al the chirche. Erastus, tresorere of the city, gretith you wel, and Quartus brother.
28349	45	16	24	The grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist be with you alle.
28350	45	16	25	Amen. And onour and glorie be to hym, that is myyti to conferme you bi my gospel, and prechyng of Jhesu Crist, bi the reuelacioun of mysterie holdun stylle in tymes euerlastinge;
28351	45	16	26	which mysterie is now maad opyn bi scripturis of prophetis, bi the comaundement of God with outen bigynnyng and endyng, to the obedience of feith in alle hethene men, the mysterie
28352	45	16	27	knowun bi Jhesu Crist to God aloone wiss, to whom be onour and glorie in to worldis of worldis. Amen.
28353	46	1	1	Poul, clepid apostle of Jhesu Crist, bi the wille of God, and Sostenes, brothir, to the chirche of God that is at Corynthe,
28354	46	1	2	to hem that ben halewid in Crist Jhesu, and clepid seyntis, with alle that inwardli clepen the name of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, in ech place of hem and of oure,
28355	46	1	3	grace to you and pees of God, oure fadir, and of the Lord Jhesu Crist.
28356	46	1	4	Y do thankyngis to my God eueremore for you, in the grace of God that is youun to you in Crist Jhesu.
28357	46	1	5	For in alle thingis ye ben maad riche in hym, in ech word, and in ech kunnyng,
28358	46	1	6	as the witnessyng of Crist is confermyd in you;
28359	46	1	7	so that no thing faile to you in ony grace, that abiden the schewyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist;
28360	46	1	8	which also schal conferme you in to the ende with outen cryme, in the dai of the comyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
28361	46	1	9	`A trewe God, bi whom ye ben clepid in to the felouschipe of his sone Jhesu Crist oure Lord.
28362	46	1	10	But, britheren, Y biseche you, bi the name of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, that ye alle seie the same thing, and that dissenciouns be not among you; but be ye perfit in the same wit, and in the same kunnyng.
28363	46	1	11	For, my britheren, it is teld to me of hem that ben at Cloes, that stryues ben among you.
28364	46	1	12	And Y seie that, that ech of you seith, For Y am of Poul, and Y am of Apollo, and Y am of Cefas, but Y am of Crist.
28365	46	1	13	Whether Crist is departid? whether Poul was crucified for you, ether ye ben baptisid in the name of Poul?
28366	46	1	14	Y do thankyngis to my God, that Y baptiside noon of you, but Crispus and Gayus;
28367	46	1	15	lest ony man seie, that ye ben baptisid in my name.
28368	46	1	16	And Y baptiside also the hous of Stephan, but Y woot not, that Y baptiside ony other.
28369	46	1	17	For Crist sente me not to baptise, but to preche the gospel; not in wisdom of word, that the cros of Crist be not voidid awei.
28370	46	1	18	For the word of the cros is foli to hem that perischen; but to hem that ben maad saaf, that is to seie, to vs, it is the vertu of God.
28371	46	1	19	For it is writun, Y schal distruye the wisdom of wise men, and Y schal reproue the prudence of prudent men.
28372	46	1	20	Where is the wise man? where is the wise lawiere? where is the purchasour of this world? Whether God hath not maad the wisdom of this world fonned?
28373	46	1	21	For the world in wisdom of God knewe not God bi wisdom, it pleside to God, bi foli of prechyng, `to maken hem saaf that bileueden.
28374	46	1	22	For Jewis seken signes, and Grekis seken wisdom;
28375	46	1	23	but we prechen Crist crucified, to Jewis sclaundre, and to hethene men foli;
28376	46	1	24	but to tho Jewis and Grekis that ben clepid, we prechen Crist the vertu of God and the wisdom of God.
28377	46	1	25	For that that is foli thing of God, is wiser than men; and that that is the feble thing of God, is strengere than men.
28378	46	1	26	But, britheren, se ye youre clepyng; for not many wise men aftir the fleisch, not many myyti, not many noble.
28379	46	1	27	But God chees tho thingis that ben fonned of the world, to confounde wise men;
28380	46	1	28	and God chees the feble thingis of the world, to confounde the stronge thingis; and God chees the vnnoble thingis `and dispisable thingis of the world, and tho thingis that ben not, to distruye tho thingis that ben;
28381	46	1	29	that ech man haue not glorie in his siyt.
28382	46	1	30	But of hym ye ben in Crist Jhesu, which is maad of God to vs wisdom, and riytwisnesse, and holynesse, and ayenbiyng; that,
28383	46	1	31	as it is wrytun, He that glorieth, haue glorie in the Lord.
28384	46	2	1	And Y, britheren, whanne Y cam to you, cam not in the heiynesse of word, ethir of wisdom, tellynge to you the witnessyng of Crist.
28385	46	2	2	For Y demede not me to kunne ony thing among you, but Crist Jhesu, and hym crucified.
28386	46	2	3	And Y in sikenesse, and drede, and myche trembling, was among you;
28387	46	2	4	and my word and my preching was not in suteli sturyng wordis of mannus wisdom, but in schewyng of spirit and of vertu;
28388	46	2	5	that youre feith be not in the wisdom of men, but in the vertu of God.
28389	46	2	6	For we speken wisdom among perfit men, but not wisdom of this world, nether of princes of this world, that ben distried;
28390	46	2	7	but we speken the wisdom of God in mysterie, `which wisdom is hid; which wisdom God bifor ordeynede bifor worldis in to oure glorie,
28391	46	2	8	which noon of the princes of this world knew; for if thei hadden knowe, thei schulden neuere haue crucified the Lord of glorie.
28392	46	2	9	But as it is writun, That iye say not, ne eere herde, nether it stiede in to herte of man, what thingis God arayede to hem that louen hym;
28393	46	2	10	but God schewide to vs bi his spirit. For whi the spirit serchith alle thingis, yhe, the depe thingis of God.
28394	46	2	11	And who of men woot, what thingis ben of man, but the spirit of man that is in hym? So what thingis ben of God, no man knowith, but the spirit of God.
28395	46	2	12	And we han not resseiued the spirit of this world, but the spirit that is of God, that we wite what thingis ben youun to vs of God.
28396	46	2	13	Whiche thingis we speken also, not in wise wordis of mannus wisdom, but in the doctryn of the spirit, and maken a liknesse of spiritual thingis to goostli men.
28397	46	2	14	For a beestli man perseyueth not tho thingis that ben of the spirit of God; for it is foli to hym, and he may not vndurstonde, for it is examyned goostli.
28398	46	2	15	But a spiritual man demeth alle thingis, and he is demed of no man.
28399	46	2	16	As it is writun, And who knew the wit of the Lord, or who tauyte hym? And we han the wit of Crist.
28400	46	3	1	And Y, britheren, myyte not speke to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleischli men;
28401	46	3	2	as to litle children in Crist, Y yaf to you mylk drynke, not mete; for ye myyten not yit, nether ye moun now, for yit ye ben fleischli.
28402	46	3	3	For while strijf is among you, whether ye ben not fleischli, and ye gon aftir man?
28403	46	3	4	For whanne summe seith, Y am of Poul, another, But Y am of Apollo, whethir ye ben not men? What therfor is Apollo, and what Poul?
28404	46	3	5	Thei ben mynystris of hym, to whom ye han bileuyd; and to ech man as God hath youun.
28405	46	3	6	Y plauntide, Apollo moystide, but God yaf encreessyng.
28406	46	3	7	Therfor nether he that plauntith is ony thing, nethir he that moistith, but God that yiueth encreessyng.
28407	46	3	8	And he that plauntith, and he that moistith, ben oon; and ech schal take his owne mede, aftir his trauel.
28408	46	3	9	For we ben the helperis of God; ye ben the erthetiliyng of God, ye ben the bildyng of God.
28409	46	3	10	Aftir the grace `of God that is youun to me, as a wise maistir carpenter Y settide the foundement; and another bildith aboue. But ech man se, hou he bildith aboue.
28410	46	3	11	For no man may sette another foundement, outtakun that that is sett, which is Crist Jhesus.
28411	46	3	12	For if ony bildith ouer this foundement, gold, siluer, preciouse stoonys, stickis, hey, or stobil, euery mannus werk schal be open;
28412	46	3	13	for the dai of the Lord schal declare, for it schal be schewid in fier; the fier schal preue the werk of ech man, what maner werk it is.
28413	46	3	14	If the werk of ony man dwelle stille, which he bildide aboue, he schal resseyue mede.
28414	46	3	15	If ony mannus werk brenne, he schal suffre harm; but he schal be saaf, so netheles as bi fier.
28415	46	3	16	Witen ye not, that ye ben the temple of God, and the spirit of God dwellith in you?
28416	46	3	17	And if ony defoulith the temple of God, God schal leese hym; for the temple of God is hooli, which ye ben.
28417	46	3	18	No man disseyue hym silf. If ony man among you is seyn to be wiys in this world, be he maad a fool, that he be wijs.
28418	46	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foli anentis God; for it is writun, Y schal catche wise men in her fel wisdom;
28419	46	3	20	and eft, The Lord knowith the thouytis of wise men, for tho ben veyn.
28420	46	3	21	Therfor no man haue glorie in men.
28421	46	3	22	For alle thingis ben youre, ethir Poul, ether Apollo, ether Cefas, ether the world, ether lijf, ether deth, ether thingis present, ethir thingis to comynge; for alle thingis ben youre,
28422	46	3	23	and ye ben of Crist, and Crist is of God.
28423	46	4	1	So a man gesse vs, as mynystris of Crist, and dispenderis of the mynysteries of God.
28424	46	4	2	Now it is souyt here among the dispenderis, that a man be foundun trewe.
28425	46	4	3	And to me it is for the leest thing, that Y be demyd of you, or of mannus dai; but nether Y deme my silf.
28426	46	4	4	For Y am no thing ouer trowynge to my silf, but not in this thing Y am iustified; for he that demeth me, is the Lord.
28427	46	4	5	Therfor nyle ye deme bifore the tyme, til that the Lord come, which schal liytne the hyd thingis of derknessis, and schal schewe the counseils of hertis; and thanne preisyng schal be to ech man of God.
28428	46	4	6	And, britheren, Y haue transfigurid these thingis in to me and in to Apollo, for you; that in vs ye lerne, lest ouer that it is writun, oon ayens another be blowun with pride for another.
28429	46	4	7	Who demeth thee? And what hast thou, that thou hast not resseyued? And if thou hast resseyued, what gloriest thou, as thou haddist not resseyued?
28430	46	4	8	Nowe ye ben fyllid, now ye ben maad riche; ye regnen with outen vs; and Y wolde that ye regnen, that also we regnen with you.
28431	46	4	9	And Y gesse, that God schewide vs the laste apostlis, as thilke that ben sent to the deth; for we ben maad a spectacle to the world, and to aungels, and to men.
28432	46	4	10	We foolis for Crist, but ye prudent in Crist; we sike, but ye stronge; ye noble, but we vnnoble.
28433	46	4	11	Til in to this our we hungren, and thirsten, and ben nakid, and ben smytun with buffatis,
28434	46	4	12	and we ben vnstable, and we trauelen worchynge with oure hondis; we ben cursid, and we blessen; we suffren persecucioun, and we abiden longe; we ben blasfemyd, and we bisechen;
28435	46	4	13	as clensyngis of this world we ben maad the `out castyng of alle thingis `til yit.
28436	46	4	14	Y write not these thingis, that Y confounde you, but Y warne as my moste dereworthe sones.
28437	46	4	15	For whi if ye han ten thousynde of vndur maistris in Crist, but not many fadris; for in Crist Jhesu Y haue gendrid you bi the gospel.
28438	46	4	16	Therfor, britheren, Y preye you, be ye foleweris of me, as Y of Crist.
28439	46	4	17	Therfor Y sente to you Tymothe, which is my most dereworthe sone, and feithful in the Lord, which schal teche you my weies, that ben in Crist Jhesu; as Y teche euery where in ech chirche.
28440	46	4	18	As thouy Y schulde not come to you, so summe ben blowun with pride;
28441	46	4	19	but Y schal come to you soone, if God wole; and Y schal knowe not the word of hem that ben blowun with pride, but the vertu.
28442	46	4	20	For the rewme of God is not in word, but in vertu.
28443	46	4	21	What wole ye? Schal Y come to you in a yerde, or in charite, and in spirit of myldenesse?
28444	46	5	1	In al maner fornycacioun is herd among you, and siche fornycacioun, which is not among hethene men, so that summan haue the wijf of his fadir.
28445	46	5	2	And ye ben bolnyd with pride, and not more hadden weilyng, that he that dide this werk, be takun awei fro the myddil of you.
28446	46	5	3	And Y absent in bodi, but present in spirit, now haue demyd as present hym that hath thus wrouyt, whanne
28447	46	5	4	ye ben gaderid togidere in the name of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, and my spirit, with the vertu of the Lord Jhesu,
28448	46	5	5	to take siche a man to Sathanas, in to the perischyng of fleisch, that the spirit be saaf in the dai of oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
28449	46	5	6	Youre gloriyng is not good. Witen ye not, that a litil sourdow apeyrith al the gobet?
28450	46	5	7	Clense ye out the old sourdow, that ye be new sprengyng togidere, as ye ben therf. For Crist offrid is oure pask.
28451	46	5	8	Therfor ete we, not in eld sourdowy, nether in sourdowy of malice and weywardnesse, but in therf thingis of clernesse and of treuthe.
28452	46	5	9	I wroot to you in a pistle, that ye be not medlid with letchours,
28453	46	5	10	not with letchours of this world, ne coueitous men, ne raueynours, ne with men seruynge to mawmetis, ellis ye schulden haue go out of this world.
28454	46	5	11	But now Y wroot to you, that ye be not meynd. But if he that is named a brother among you, and is a letchour, or coueitouse, or seruynge to ydols, or cursere, or ful of drunkenesse, or raueynour, to take no mete with siche.
28455	46	5	12	For what is it to me to deme of hem that ben with oute forth? Whether ye demen not of thingis that ben with ynne forth?
28456	46	5	13	For God schal deme hem that ben withouten forth. Do ye awei yuel fro you silf.
28457	46	6	1	Dar any of you that hath a cause ayens another, be demed at wickid men, and not at hooli men?
28458	46	6	2	Whether ye witen not, that seyntis schulen deme of this world? And if the world schal be demed bi you, be ye vnworthi to deme of the leste thingis?
28459	46	6	3	Witen ye not, that we schulen deme aungels? hou myche more worldli thingis?
28460	46	6	4	Therfor if ye han worldli domes, ordeyne ye tho contemptible men, that ben in the chirche, to deme.
28461	46	6	5	Y seie to make you aschamed. So ther is not ony wise man, that may deme bitwixe a brothir and his brothir;
28462	46	6	6	but a brothir with brothir stryueth in dom, and that among vnfeithful men.
28463	46	6	7	And now trespas is algatis in you, for ye han domes among you. Whi rather take ye no wrong? whi rather suffre ye not disseit?
28464	46	6	8	But and ye doen wrong, and doen fraude, and that to britheren.
28465	46	6	9	Whether ye witen not, that wickid men schulen not welde the kyngdom of God? Nyle ye erre; nethir letchours, nether men that seruen mawmetis, nether auouteris,
28466	46	6	10	nether letchouris ayen kynde, nether thei that doon letcheri with men, nether theues, nether auerouse men, nethir `ful of drunkenesse, nether curseris, nether rauenours, schulen welde the kyngdom of God.
28467	46	6	11	And ye weren sum tyme these thingis; but ye ben waischun, but ye ben halewid, but ye ben iustefied in the name of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, and in the spirit of oure God.
28468	46	6	12	Alle thingis ben leeueful to me, but not alle thingis ben spedeful. Alle thingis ben leeueful to me, but Y schal not be brouyt doun vndur ony mannus power.
28469	46	6	13	Mete to the wombe, and the wombe to metis; and God schal distruye bothe this and that. And the bodi not to fornycacioun, but to the Lord, and the Lord to the bodi.
28470	46	6	14	For God reiside the Lord, and schal reise vs bi his vertu.
28471	46	6	15	Witen ye not, that youre bodies ben membris of Crist? Schal Y thanne take the membris of Crist, and schal Y make the membris of an hoore? God forbede.
28472	46	6	16	Whether ye witen not, that he that cleueth to an hoore, is maad o bodi? For he seith, Ther schulen be tweyne in o fleisch.
28473	46	6	17	And he that cleueth to the Lord, is o spirit.
28474	46	6	18	Fle ye fornycacioun; al synne what euere synne a man doith, is with out the bodi; but he that doith fornycacioun, synneth ayens his bodi.
28475	46	6	19	Whether ye witen not, that youre membris ben the temple of the Hooli Goost, that is in you, whom ye han of God, and ye ben not youre owne?
28476	46	6	20	For ye ben bouyt with greet prijs. Glorifie ye, and bere ye God in youre bodi.
28477	46	7	1	But of thilke thingis that ye han write to me, it is good to a man to touche not a womman.
28478	46	7	2	But for fornycacioun eche man haue his owne wijf, and ech womman haue hir owne hosebonde.
28479	46	7	3	The hosebonde yelde dette to the wijf, and also the wijf to the hosebonde.
28480	46	7	4	The womman hath not power of hir bodi, but the hosebonde; and the hosebonde hath not power of his bodi, but the womman.
28481	46	7	5	Nyle ye defraude eche to othere, but perauenture of consent to a tyme, that ye yyue tent to preier; and eft turne ye ayen to the same thing, lest Sathanas tempte you for youre vncontynence.
28482	46	7	6	But Y seie this thing as yyuyng leeue, not bi comaundement.
28483	46	7	7	For Y wole, that alle men be as my silf. But eche man hath his propre yifte of God; oon thus, and another thus.
28484	46	7	8	But Y seie to hem, that ben not weddid, and to widewis, it is good to hem, if thei dwellen so as Y.
28485	46	7	9	That if thei conteynen not hem silf, be thei weddid; for it is betere to be weddid, than to be brent.
28486	46	7	10	But to hem that ben ioyned in matrymonye, Y comaunde, not Y, but the Lord, that the wijf departe not fro the hosebonde;
28487	46	7	11	and that if sche departith, that sche dwelle vnweddid, or be recounselid to hir hosebonde; and the hosebonde forsake not the wijf.
28488	46	7	12	But to othere Y seie, not the Lord. If ony brother hath an vnfeithful wijf, and sche consenteth to dwelle with hym, leeue he hir not.
28489	46	7	13	And if ony womman hath an vnfeithful hosebonde, and this consentith to dwelle with hir, leeue sche not the hosebonde.
28490	46	7	14	For the vnfeithful hosebonde is halewid bi the feithful womman, and the vnfeithful womman is halewid bi the feithful hosebonde. Ellis youre children weren vncleene, but now thei ben hooli.
28491	46	7	15	That if the vnfeithful departith, departe he. For whi the brother or sistir is not suget to seruage in siche; for God hath clepid vs in pees.
28492	46	7	16	And wherof wost thou, womman, if thou schalt make the man saaf; or wherof wost thou, man, if thou schalt make the womman saaf?
28493	46	7	17	But as the Lord hath departid to ech, and as God hath clepid ech man, so go he, as Y teche in alle chirchis.
28494	46	7	18	A man circumcidid is clepid, brynge he not to the prepucie. A man is clepid in prepucie, be he not circumcidid.
28495	46	7	19	Circumcisioun is nouyt, and prepucie is nouyt, but the kepyng of the maundementis of God.
28496	46	7	20	Ech man in what clepyng he is clepid, in that dwelle he.
28497	46	7	21	Thou seruaunt art clepid, be it no charge to thee; but if thou maist be fre, `the rather vse thou.
28498	46	7	22	He that is a seruaunt, and is clepid in the Lord, is a freman of the Lord. Also he that is a freman, and is clepid, is the seruaunt of Crist.
28499	46	7	23	With prijs ye ben bouyt; nyle ye be maad seruauntis of men.
28500	46	7	24	Therfor ech man in what thing he is clepid a brothir, dwelle he in this anentis God.
28501	46	7	25	But of virgyns Y haue no comaundement of God; but Y yyue counseil, as he that hath mercy of the Lord, that Y be trewe.
28502	46	7	26	Therfor Y gesse, that this thing is good for the present nede; for it is good to a man to be so.
28503	46	7	27	Thou art boundun to a wijf, nyle thou seke vnbyndyng; thou art vnboundun fro a wijf, nyle thou seke a wijf.
28504	46	7	28	But if thou hast takun a wijf, thou hast not synned; and if a maidun is weddid, sche synnede not; nethelesse siche schulen haue tribulacioun of fleisch.
28505	46	7	29	But Y spare you. Therfor, britheren, Y seie this thing, The tyme is schort. Another is this, that thei that han wyues, be as thouy thei hadden noon;
28506	46	7	30	and thei that wepen, as thei wepten not; and thei that ioien, as thei ioieden not; and thei that bien, as thei hadden not;
28507	46	7	31	and thei that vsen this world, as thei that vsen not. For whi the figure of this world passith.
28508	46	7	32	But Y wole, that ye be without bisynesse, for he that is without wijf, is bisi what thingis ben of the Lord, hou he schal plese God.
28509	46	7	33	But he that is with a wijf, is bysy what thingis ben of the world, hou he schal plese the wijf, and he is departid.
28510	46	7	34	And a womman vnweddid and maidun thenkith what thingis ben of the Lord, that sche be hooli in bodi and spirit. But sche that is weddid, thenkith what thingis ben of the world, hou sche schal plese the hosebonde.
28511	46	7	35	And Y seie these thingis to youre profit, not that Y caste to you a snare, but to that that is onest, and that yyueth esynesse, with outen lettyng to make preieris to the Lord.
28512	46	7	36	And if ony man gessith hym silf to be seyn foule on his virgyn, that sche is ful woxun, and so it bihoueth to be doon, do sche that that sche wole; sche synneth not, if sche be weddid.
28513	46	7	37	For he that ordeynede stabli in his herte, not hauynge nede, but hauynge power of his wille, and hath demed in his herte this thing, to kepe his virgyn, doith wel.
28514	46	7	38	Therfore he that ioyneth his virgyn in matrymonye, doith wel; and he that ioyneth not, doith betere.
28515	46	7	39	The womman is boundun to the lawe, as longe tyme as hir hosebonde lyueth; and if hir hosebonde is deed, sche is delyuered fro the lawe of the hosebonde, be sche weddid to whom sche wole, oneli in the Lord.
28516	46	7	40	But sche schal be more blessid, if sche dwellith thus, aftir my counsel; and Y wene, that Y haue the Spirit of God.
28517	46	8	1	But of these thingis that ben sacrified to ydols, we witen, for alle we han kunnyng. But kunnyng blowith, charite edefieth.
28518	46	8	2	But if ony man gessith, that he kan ony thing, he hath not yit knowe hou it bihoueth hym to kunne.
28519	46	8	3	And if ony man loueth God, this is knowun of hym.
28520	46	8	4	But of metis that ben offrid to idols, we witen, that an idol is no thing in the world, and that ther is no God but oon.
28521	46	8	5	For thouy ther ben summe that ben seid goddis, ethir in heuene, ether in erthe, as ther ben many goddis, and many lordis;
28522	46	8	6	netheles to vs is o God, the fadir, of whom ben alle thingis, and we in hym; and o Lord Jhesu Crist, bi whom ben alle thingis, and we bi hym.
28523	46	8	7	But not in alle men is kunnyng. For summen with conscience of ydol til now eten as thing offrid to idolis; and her conscience is defoulid, for it is sijk.
28524	46	8	8	Mete comendith vs not to God; for nether we schulen faile, if we eten not, nether if we eten, we schulen haue plente.
28525	46	8	9	But se ye, lest perauenture this your leeue be maad hurtyng to sijke men.
28526	46	8	10	For if ony man schal se hym, that hath kunnyng, etynge in a place where idols ben worschipid, whethir his conscience, sithen it is sijke, schal not be edified to ete thingis offrid to idols?
28527	46	8	11	And the sijk brothir, for whom Crist diede, schal perische in thi kunnyng.
28528	46	8	12	For thus ye synnyng ayens britheren, and smytynge her sijk conscience synnen ayens Crist.
28529	46	8	13	Wherfor if mete sclaundrith my brother, Y schal neuere ete fleisch, lest Y sclaundre my brothir.
28530	46	9	1	Whether Y am not fre? Am Y not apostle? Whether Y saiy not `Crist Jhesu, `oure Lord? Whether ye ben not my werk in the Lord?
28531	46	9	2	And thouy to othere Y am not apostle, but netheles to you Y am; for ye ben the litle signe of myn apostlehed in the Lord.
28532	46	9	3	My defense to hem that axen me, that is.
28533	46	9	4	Whether we han not power to ete and drynke?
28534	46	9	5	Whether we han not power to lede aboute a womman a sistir, as also othere apostlis, and britheren of the Lord, and Cefas?
28535	46	9	6	Or Y aloone and Barnabas han not power to worche these thingis?
28536	46	9	7	Who traueilith ony tyme with hise owne wagis? Who plauntith a vynyerd, and etith not of his fruyt? Who kepith a flok, and etith not of the mylk of the flok?
28537	46	9	8	Whether aftir man Y sey these thingis? whether also the lawe seith not these thingis?
28538	46	9	9	For it is writun in the lawe of Moises, Thou schalt not bynde the mouth of the ox threischynge. Whethir of oxun is charge to God?
28539	46	9	10	Whether for vs he seith these thingis? For whi tho ben writun for vs; for he that erith, owith to ere in hope, and he that threischith, in hope to take fruytis.
28540	46	9	11	If we sowen spiritual thingis to you, is it grete, if we repen youre fleischli thingis?
28541	46	9	12	If othere ben parteneris of youre power, whi not rathere we? But we vsen not this power, but we suffren alle thingis, that we yyuen no lettyng to the euangelie of Crist.
28542	46	9	13	Witen ye not, that thei that worchen in the temple, eten tho thingis that ben of the temple, and thei that seruen to the auter, ben partyneris of the auter?
28543	46	9	14	So the Lord ordeynede to hem that tellen the gospel, to lyue of the gospel.
28544	46	9	15	But Y vside noon of these thingis; sotheli Y wroot not these thingis, that tho be don so in me; for it is good `to me rather to die, than that ony man `auoyde my glorie.
28545	46	9	16	For if Y preche the gospel, glorie is not to me, for nedelich Y mot don it; for wo to me, if Y preche not the gospel.
28546	46	9	17	But if Y do this thing wilfuli, Y haue mede; but if ayens my wille, dispending is bitakun to me.
28547	46	9	18	What thanne is my mede? That Y prechynge the gospel, putte the gospel with outen otheris cost, that Y vse not my power in the gospel.
28548	46	9	19	Forwhi whanne Y was fre of alle men, Y made me seruaunt of alle men, to wynne the mo men.
28549	46	9	20	And to Jewis Y am maad as a Jew, to wynne the Jewis; to hem that ben vndur the lawe,
28550	46	9	21	as Y were vndur the lawe, whanne Y was not vndur the lawe, to wynne hem that weren vndur the lawe; to hem that weren with out lawe, as Y were with out lawe, whanne Y was not with out the lawe of God, but Y was in the lawe of Crist, to wynne hem that weren with out lawe.
28551	46	9	22	Y am maad sijk to sike men, to wynne sike men; to alle men Y am maad alle thingis, to make alle men saaf.
28552	46	9	23	But Y do alle thingis for the gospel, that Y be maad partener of it.
28553	46	9	24	Witen ye not, that thei that rennen in a furlong, alle rennen, but oon takith the prijs? So renne ye, that ye catche.
28554	46	9	25	Ech man that stryueth in fiyt, absteyneth hym fro alle thingis; and thei, that thei take a corruptible coroun, but we an vncorrupt.
28555	46	9	26	Therfor Y renne so, not as `in to vncerteyn thing; thus Y fiyte, not as betynge the eir;
28556	46	9	27	but Y chastise my bodi, and bryng it in to seruage; lest perauenture whanne Y preche to othere, Y my silf be maad repreuable.
28557	46	10	1	Britheren, Y nyle, that ye vnknowe, that alle oure fadris weren vndur cloude, and alle passiden the see;
28558	46	10	2	and alle weren baptisid in Moises, in the cloude and in the see;
28559	46	10	3	and alle eeten the same spiritual mete,
28560	46	10	4	and alle drunken the same spiritual drynke; thei drunken of the spiritual stoon folewynge hem; and the stoon was Crist.
28561	46	10	5	But not in ful manye of hem it was wel pleasaunt to God; for whi thei weren cast doun in desert.
28562	46	10	6	But these thingis ben don in figure of vs, that we be not coueyteris of yuele thingis, as thei coueitiden.
28563	46	10	7	Nether be ye maad idolatreris, as summe of hem; as it is writun, The puple sat to ete and drynke, and thei risen vp to pleie.
28564	46	10	8	Nether do we fornycacioun, as summe of hem diden fornicacioun, and thre and twenti thousyndis weren deed in o dai.
28565	46	10	9	Nethir tempte we Crist, as summe of hem temptiden, and perischiden of serpentis.
28566	46	10	10	Nether grutche ye, as summe of hem grutchiden, and thei perischiden of a distrier.
28567	46	10	11	And alle these thingis felliden to hem in figure; but thei ben writun to oure amendyng, in to whiche the endis of the worldis ben comun.
28568	46	10	12	Therfor he that gessith hym, `that he stondith, se he, that he falle not.
28569	46	10	13	Temptacioun take `not you, but mannus temptacioun; for God is trewe, which schal not suffre you to be temptid aboue that that ye moun; but he schal make with temptacioun also purueyaunce, that ye moun suffre.
28570	46	10	14	Wherfor, ye most dereworthe to me, fle ye fro worschiping of maumetis.
28571	46	10	15	As to prudent men Y speke, deme ye you silf that thing that Y seie.
28572	46	10	16	Whether the cuppe of blessyng which we blessen, is not the comynyng of Cristis blood? and whether the breed which we breken, is not the takyng of the bodi of the Lord?
28573	46	10	17	For we manye ben o breed and o bodi, alle we that taken part of o breed and of o cuppe.
28574	46	10	18	Se ye Israel aftir the fleisch, whethir thei that eeten sacrifices, ben not partyneris of the auter?
28575	46	10	19	What therfor seie Y, that a thing that is offrid to idols is ony thing, or that the idol is ony thing?
28576	46	10	20	But tho thingis that hethene men offren, thei offren to deuelis, and not to God. But Y nyle, that ye ben maad felowis of feendis; for ye moun not drynke the cuppe of the Lord, and the cuppe of fendis;
28577	46	10	21	ye moun not be parteneris of the boord of the Lord, and of the bord of feendis.
28578	46	10	22	Whether we han enuye to the Lord? whether we ben strengere then he? Alle thingis ben leeueful to me, but not alle thingis ben spedeful.
28579	46	10	23	Alle thingis ben leeueful to me, but not alle thingis edifien.
28580	46	10	24	No man seke that thing that is his owne, but that thing that is of an othere.
28581	46	10	25	Al thing that is seld in the bocherie, ete ye, axynge no thing for conscience.
28582	46	10	26	The erthe and the plente of it is, the Lordis.
28583	46	10	27	If ony of hethene men clepith you to soper, and ye wole go, al thing that is set to you, ete ye, axynge no thing for conscience.
28584	46	10	28	But if ony man seith, This thing is offrid to idols, nyle ye ete, for hym that schewide, and for conscience; and Y seie not,
28585	46	10	29	thi conscience, but of an othere. But wherto is my fredom demed of an othere mannus conscience?
28586	46	10	30	Therfor if Y take part with grace, what am Y blasfemed, for that that Y do thankyngis?
28587	46	10	31	Therfor whether ye eten, or drynken, or don ony other thing, do ye alle thingis `in to the glorie of God.
28588	46	10	32	Be ye with outen sclaundre to Jewis, and to hethene men, and to the chirche of God;
28589	46	10	33	as Y bi alle thingis plese to alle men, not sekynge that that is profitable to me, but that that is profitable to manye men, that thei be maad saaf.
28590	46	11	1	Be ye my foleweris, as Y am of Crist.
28591	46	11	2	And, britheren, Y preise you, that bi alle thingis ye ben myndeful of me; and as Y bitook to you my comaundementis, ye holden.
28592	46	11	3	But Y wole that ye wite, that Crist is heed of ech man; but the heed of the womman is the man; and the heed of Crist is God.
28593	46	11	4	Ech man preiynge, or profeciynge, whanne his heed is hilid, defoulith his heed.
28594	46	11	5	But ech womman preiynge, or profeciynge, whanne hir heed is not hilid, defoulith hir heed; for it is oon, as if sche were pollid.
28595	46	11	6	And if a womman be not keuered, be sche pollid; and if it is foul thing to a womman to be pollid, or to be maad ballid, hile sche hir heed.
28596	46	11	7	But a man schal not hile his heed, for he is the ymage and the glorie of God; but a womman is the glorie of man.
28597	46	11	8	For a man is not of the womman, but the womman of the man.
28598	46	11	9	And the man is not maad for the womman, but the womman for the man.
28599	46	11	10	Therfor the womman schal haue an hilyng on hir heed, also for aungelis.
28600	46	11	11	Netheles nether the man is with outen womman, nether the womman is with oute man, in the Lord.
28601	46	11	12	Forwhi as the womman is of man, so the man is bi the womman; but alle thingis ben of God.
28602	46	11	13	Deme ye you silf; bisemeth it a womman not hilid on the heed to preye God?
28603	46	11	14	Nether the kynde it silf techith vs, for if a man nursche longe heer, it is schenschipe to hym;
28604	46	11	15	but if a womman nurische longe heer, it is glorie to hir, for heeris ben youun to hir for keueryng.
28605	46	11	16	But if ony man is seyn to be ful of strijf, we han noon siche custom, nethir the chirche of God.
28606	46	11	17	But this thing Y comaunde, not preisynge, that ye comen togidere not in to the betere, but in to the worse.
28607	46	11	18	First for whanne ye comen togidere in to the chirche, Y here that discenciouns ben, and in parti Y bileue.
28608	46	11	19	For it bihoueth eresies to be, that thei that ben prouyd, ben opynli knowun in you.
28609	46	11	20	Therfor whanne ye comen togidere in to oon, now it is not to ete the Lordis soper;
28610	46	11	21	for whi ech man bifor takith his soper to ete, and oon is hungry, and another is drunkun.
28611	46	11	22	Whether ye han not housis to ete and drynke, or ye dispisen the chirche of God, and confounden hem that han noon? What schal Y seie to you? Y preise you, but here yn Y preise you not.
28612	46	11	23	For Y haue takun of the Lord that thing, which Y haue bitakun to you. For the Lord Jhesu, in what niyt he was bitraied,
28613	46	11	24	took breed, and dide thankyngis, and brak, and seide, Take ye, and ete ye; this is my bodi, which schal be bitraied for you; do ye this thing in to my mynde.
28614	46	11	25	Also the cuppe, aftir that he hadde soupid, and seide, This cuppe is the newe testament in my blood; do ye this thing, as ofte as ye schulen drynke, in to my mynde.
28615	46	11	26	For as ofte as ye schulen ete this breed, and schulen drynke the cuppe, ye schulen telle the deth of the Lord, til that he come.
28616	46	11	27	Therfor who euere etith the breed, or drynkith the cuppe of the Lord vnworthili, he schal be gilti of the bodi and of the blood of the Lord.
28617	46	11	28	But preue a man hym silf, and so ete he of `the ilke breed, and drynke of the cuppe.
28618	46	11	29	For he that etith and drinkith vnworthili, etith and drinkith doom to hym, not wiseli demyng the bodi of the Lord.
28619	46	11	30	Therfor among you many ben sijke and feble, and manye slepen.
28620	46	11	31	And if we demyden wiseli vs silf, we schulden not be demyd;
28621	46	11	32	but while we ben demyd of the Lord, we ben chastisid, that we be not dampnyd with this world.
28622	46	11	33	Therfor, my britheren, whanne ye comen togidere to ete, abide ye togidere.
28623	46	11	34	If ony man hungrith, ete he at home, that ye come not togidere in to doom. And Y schal dispose othere thingis, whanne Y come.
28624	46	12	1	But of spiritual thingis, britheren, Y nyle that ye vnknowun.
28625	46	12	2	For ye witen, that whanne ye weren hethene men, hou ye weren led goynge to doumbe maumetis.
28626	46	12	3	Therfor Y make knowun to you, that no man spekynge in the spirit of God, seith departyng fro Jhesu; and no man may seie the Lord Jhesu, but in the Hooli Goost.
28627	46	12	4	And dyuerse graces ther ben, but it is al oon Spirit;
28628	46	12	5	and dyuerse seruyces ther ben, but it is al oon Lord; and dyuerse worchingis ther ben,
28629	46	12	6	but `al is oon God, that worchith alle thingis in alle thingis.
28630	46	12	7	And to ech man the schewyng of spirit is youun to profit. The word of wisdom is youun to oon bi spirit;
28631	46	12	8	to another the word of kunnyng, bi the same spirit;
28632	46	12	9	feith to another, in the same spirit; to anothere, grace of helthis, in o spirit;
28633	46	12	10	to another, the worchyng of vertues; to another, profecie; to another, very knowyng of spiritis; to another, kyndis of langagis; to another, expownyng of wordis.
28634	46	12	11	And oon and the same spirit worchith alle these thingis, departynge to ech bi hem silf as he wole.
28635	46	12	12	For as ther is o body, and hath many membris, and alle the membris of the bodi whanne tho ben manye, ben o bodi, so also Crist.
28636	46	12	13	For in o spirit alle we ben baptisid `in to o bodi, ether Jewis, ether hethene, ether seruauntis, ether free; and alle we ben fillid with drink in o spirit.
28637	46	12	14	For the bodi is not o membre, but manye.
28638	46	12	15	If the foot seith, For Y am not the hoond, Y am not of the bodi; not therfor it is not of the bodi.
28639	46	12	16	And if the ere seith, For Y am not the iye, Y am not of the bodi; not therfor it is not of the bodi.
28640	46	12	17	If al the bodi is the iye, where is heryng? and if al the bodi is heryng, where is smellyng?
28641	46	12	18	But now God hath set membris, and ech of hem in the bodi, as he wolde.
28642	46	12	19	That if alle weren o membre, where were the bodi?
28643	46	12	20	But now ther ben many membris, but o bodi.
28644	46	12	21	And the iye may not seie to the hond, Y haue no nede to thi werkis; or eft the heed to the feet, Ye ben not necessarie to me.
28645	46	12	22	But myche more tho that ben seyn to be the lowere membris of the bodi, ben more nedeful;
28646	46	12	23	and thilke that we gessen to be the vnworthier membris of the bodi, we yyuen more honour `to hem; and tho membris that ben vnonest, han more oneste.
28647	46	12	24	For oure oneste membris han nede of noon; but God tempride the bodi, yyuynge more worschip to it, to whom it failide,
28648	46	12	25	that debate be not in the bodi, but that the membris be bisi in to the same thing ech for othere.
28649	46	12	26	And if o membre suffrith ony thing, alle membris suffren therwith; ethir if o membre ioieth, alle membris ioien togidere.
28650	46	12	27	And ye ben the bodi of Crist, and membris of membre.
28651	46	12	28	But God sette sum men in the chirche, fyrst apostlis, the secunde tyme prophetis, the thridde techeris, aftirward vertues, aftirward graces of heelyngis, helpyngis, gouernails, kyndis of langagis, interpretaciouns of wordis.
28652	46	12	29	Whether alle apostlis? whethir alle prophetis? whether alle techeris? whether alle vertues?
28653	46	12	30	whether alle men han grace of heelyngis? whether alle speken with langagis? whether alle expownen?
28654	46	12	31	But sue ye the betere goostli yiftis. And yit Y schewe to you a more exellent weye.
28655	46	13	1	If Y speke with tungis of men and of aungels, and Y haue not charite, Y am maad as bras sownynge, or a cymbal tynkynge.
28656	46	13	2	And if Y haue prophecie, and knowe alle mysteries, and al kunnynge, and if Y haue al feith, so that Y meue hillis fro her place, and Y haue not charite, Y am nouyt.
28657	46	13	3	And if Y departe alle my goodis in to the metis of pore men, and yf Y bitake my bodi, so that Y brenne, and if Y haue not charite, it profitith to me no thing.
28658	46	13	4	Charite is pacient, it is benygne; charite enuyeth not, it doith not wickidli, it is not blowun,
28659	46	13	5	it is not coueytouse, it sekith not tho thingis that ben hise owne, it is not stirid to wraththe, it thenkith not yuel,
28660	46	13	6	it ioyeth not on wickidnesse, but it ioieth togidere to treuthe;
28661	46	13	7	it suffrith alle thingis, it bileueth alle thingis, it hopith alle thingis, it susteyneth alle thingis.
28662	46	13	8	Charite fallith neuere doun, whether prophecies schulen be voidid, ethir langagis schulen ceesse, ethir science schal be distried.
28663	46	13	9	For a parti we knowun, and a parti we prophecien;
28664	46	13	10	but whanne that schal come that is parfit, that thing that is of parti schal be auoidid.
28665	46	13	11	Whanne Y was a litil child, Y spak as a litil child, Y vndurstood as a litil child, Y thouyte as a litil child; but whanne Y was maad a man, Y auoidide tho thingis that weren of a litil child.
28666	46	13	12	And we seen now bi a myrour in derknesse, but thanne face to face; now Y knowe of parti, but thanne Y schal knowe, as Y am knowun.
28667	46	13	13	And now dwellen feith, hope, and charite, these thre; but the most of these is charite.
28668	46	14	1	Sue ye charite, loue ye spiritual thingis, but more that ye prophecien.
28669	46	14	2	And he that spekith in tunge, spekith not to men, but to God; for no man herith. But the spirit spekith mysteries.
28670	46	14	3	For he that prophecieth, spekith to men to edificacioun, and monestyng, and coumfortyng.
28671	46	14	4	He that spekith in tunge, edifieth hym silf; but he that prophecieth, edifieth the chirche of God.
28672	46	14	5	And Y wole, that alle ye speke in tungis, but more that ye prophecie. For he that prophecieth, is more than he that spekith in langagis; but perauenture he expoune, that the chirche take edificacioun.
28673	46	14	6	But now, britheren, if Y come to you, and speke in langagis, what schal Y profite to you, but if Y speke to you ethir in reuelacioun, ethir in science, ethir in prophecie, ether in techyng?
28674	46	14	7	For tho thingis that ben withouten soule, and yyueth voices, ethir pipe, ether harpe, but tho yyuen distinccioun of sownyngis, hou schal it be knowun that is sungun, ether that that is trumpid?
28675	46	14	8	For if a trumpe yyue an vncerteyn soune, who schal make hym silf redi to batel?
28676	46	14	9	So but ye yyuen an opyn word bi tunge, hou schal that that is seid be knowun? For ye schulen be spekynge in veyn.
28677	46	14	10	There ben many kyndis of langagis in this world, and no thing is with outen vois.
28678	46	14	11	But if Y knowe not the vertu of a vois, Y schal be to hym, to whom Y schal speke, a barbarik; and he that spekith to me, schal be a barbarik.
28679	46	14	12	So ye, for ye ben loueris of spiritis, seke ye that ye be plenteuouse to edificacioun of the chirche.
28680	46	14	13	And therfor he that spekith in langage, preie, that he expowne.
28681	46	14	14	For if Y preye in tunge, my spirit preieth; myn vndurstondyng is with outen fruyt.
28682	46	14	15	What thanne? Y schal preye in spirit, Y schal preye in mynde; Y schal seie salm, in spirit, Y schal seie salm also in mynde.
28683	46	14	16	For if thou blessist in spirit, who fillith the place of an ydiot, hou schal he seie Amen on thi blessyng, for he woot not, what thou seist?
28684	46	14	17	For thou doist wel thankyngis, but an othir man is not edefied.
28685	46	14	18	Y thanke my God, for Y speke in the langage of alle you;
28686	46	14	19	but in the chirche Y wole speke fyue wordis in my wit, that also Y teche othere men, than ten thousynde of wordis in tunge.
28687	46	14	20	Britheren, nyle ye be maad children in wittis, but in malice be ye children; but in wittis be ye parfit.
28688	46	14	21	For in the lawe it is writun, That in othere tungis and othere lippis Y schal speke to this puple, and nether so thei schulen here me, seith the Lord.
28689	46	14	22	Therfor langagis ben in to tokene, not to feithful men, but to men out of the feith; but prophecies ben not to men out of the feith, but to feithful men.
28690	46	14	23	Therfor if alle the chirche come togidere in to oon, and alle men speken in tungis, if idiotis, ether men out of the feith, entren, whether thei schulen not seie, What ben ye woode?
28691	46	14	24	But if alle men prophecien, if ony vnfeithful man or idiot entre, he is conuyct of alle, he is wiseli demyd of alle.
28692	46	14	25	For the hid thingis of his herte ben knowun, and so he schal falle doun on the face, and schal worschipe God, and schewe verili that God is in you.
28693	46	14	26	What thanne, britheren? Whanne ye comen togidere, ech of you hath a salm, he hath techyng, he hath apocalips, he hath tunge, he hath expownyng; alle thingis be thei don to edificacioun.
28694	46	14	27	Whether a man spekith in tunge, bi twei men, ethir thre at the moste, and bi partis, that oon interprete.
28695	46	14	28	But if there be not an interpretour, be he stille in the chirche, and speke he to hym silf and to God.
28696	46	14	29	Prophetis tweine or thre seie, and othere wiseli deme.
28697	46	14	30	But if ony thing be schewid to a sittere, the formere be stille.
28698	46	14	31	For ye moun `prophecie alle, ech bi hym silf, that alle men lerne, and alle moneste.
28699	46	14	32	And the spiritis of prophetis ben suget to prophetis;
28700	46	14	33	for whi God is not of discencioun, but of pees; as in alle chirchis of hooli men `Y teche.
28701	46	14	34	Wymmen in chirchis be stille; for it is not suffrid to hem to speke, but to be suget, as the lawe seith.
28702	46	14	35	But if thei wolen ony thing lerne, `at home axe thei her hosebondis; for it is foule thing to a womman to speke in chirche.
28703	46	14	36	Whether `of you the word of God cam forth, or to you aloone it cam?
28704	46	14	37	If ony man is seyn to be a prophete, or spiritual, knowe he tho thingis that Y write to you, for tho ben the comaundementis of the Lord.
28705	46	14	38	And if ony man vnknowith, he schal be vnknowun.
28706	46	14	39	`Therfor, britheren, loue ye to prophecie, and nyle ye forbede to speke in tungis.
28707	46	14	40	But be alle thingis don onestli, and bi due ordre in you.
28708	46	15	1	`Sotheli, britheren, Y make the gospel knowun to you, which Y haue prechid to you, the which also ye han takun, in which ye stonden,
28709	46	15	2	also bi which ye schulen be sauyd; `bi which resoun Y haue prechid to you, if ye holden, `if ye han not bileuyd ideli.
28710	46	15	3	For Y bitook to you at the bigynnyng that thing which also Y haue resseyued; that Crist was deed for oure synnes, bi the scripturis;
28711	46	15	4	and that he was biried, and that he roos ayen in the thridde dai, after scripturis;
28712	46	15	5	and that he was seyn to Cephas, and aftir these thingis to enleuene;
28713	46	15	6	aftirward he was seyn to mo than fyue hundrid britheren togidere, of whiche manye lyuen yit, but summe ben deed; aftirward he was seyn to James,
28714	46	15	7	and aftirward to alle the apostlis.
28715	46	15	8	And last of alle he was seyn also to me, as to a deed borun child.
28716	46	15	9	For Y am the leste of apostlis, that am not worthi to be clepid apostle, for Y pursuede the chirche of God.
28717	46	15	10	But bi the grace of God Y am that thing that Y am; and his grace was not voide in me. For Y trauelide more plenteuously than alle thei; but not Y, but the grace of God with me.
28718	46	15	11	But whether Y, or thei, so we han prechid, and so ye han bileuyd.
28719	46	15	12	And if Crist is prechid, that he roos ayen fro deeth, hou seien summen among you, that the ayenrisyng of deed men is not?
28720	46	15	13	And if the ayenrisyng of deed men is not, nethir Crist roos ayen fro deeth.
28721	46	15	14	And if Crist roos not, oure preching is veyn, oure feith is veyn.
28722	46	15	15	And we ben foundun false witnessis of God, for we han seid witnessyng ayens God, that he reiside Crist, whom he reiside not, if deed men risen not ayen.
28723	46	15	16	Forwhi if deed men risen not ayen, nether Crist roos ayen;
28724	46	15	17	and if Crist roos not ayen, oure feith is veyn; and yit ye ben in youre synnes.
28725	46	15	18	And thanne thei that han diede in Crist, han perischid.
28726	46	15	19	If in this life oneli we ben hoping in Crist, we ben more wretchis than alle men.
28727	46	15	20	But now Crist roos ayen fro deth, the firste fruit of deed men;
28728	46	15	21	for deeth was bi a man, and bi a man is ayenrisyng fro deth.
28729	46	15	22	And as in Adam alle men dien, so in Crist alle men schulen be quykenyd.
28730	46	15	23	But ech man in his ordre; the firste fruit, Crist, afterward thei that ben of Crist, that bileueden in the comyng of Crist;
28731	46	15	24	aftirward an ende, whanne he schal bitake the kyngdom to God and to the fadir, whanne he schal auoide al princehod, and power, and vertu.
28732	46	15	25	But it bihoueth hym to regne, til he putte alle hise enemyes vndur hise feet.
28733	46	15	26	And at the laste, deth the enemye schal be distried; for he hath maad suget alle thingis vndur hise feet.
28734	46	15	27	And whanne he seith, alle thingis ben suget to hym, with outen doubt outakun hym that sugetide alle thingis to hym.
28735	46	15	28	And whanne alle thingis ben suget to hym, thanne the sone hym silf schal be suget to hym, that made `alle thingis suget to hym, that God be alle thingis in alle thingis.
28736	46	15	29	Ellis what schulen thei do, that ben baptisid for deed men, if in no wise deed men risen ayen? wherto ben thei baptisid for hem?
28737	46	15	30	And wherto ben we in perel euery our?
28738	46	15	31	Ech dai Y die for youre glorie, britheren, which glorie Y haue in Crist Jhesu oure Lord.
28739	46	15	32	If aftir man Y haue fouyten to beestis at Efesi, what profitith it to me, if deed men risen not ayen? Ete we, and drynke we, for we schulen die to morewe.
28740	46	15	33	Nyle ye be disseyued; for yuel spechis distrien good thewis.
28741	46	15	34	Awake ye, iuste men, and nyle ye do synne; for summen han ignoraunce of God, but to reuerence Y speke to you.
28742	46	15	35	But summan seith, Hou schulen deed men rise ayen, or in what maner bodi schulen thei come?
28743	46	15	36	Vnwise man, that thing that thou sowist, is not quykened, but it die first;
28744	46	15	37	and that thing that thou sowist, `thou sowist not the bodi that is to come, but a nakid corn, as of whete, or of summe othere seedis;
28745	46	15	38	and God yyueth to it a bodi, as he wole, and to ech of seedis a propir bodi.
28746	46	15	39	Not ech fleisch is the same fleisch, but oon is of men, another is of beestis, another is of briddis, an othere of fischis.
28747	46	15	40	And `heuenli bodies ben, and `ertheli bodies ben; but oon glorie is of heuenely bodies, and anothir is of ertheli.
28748	46	15	41	An othere clerenesse is of the sunne, anothere clerenesse is of the moone, and anothere clerenesse is of sterris; and a sterre dyuersith fro a sterre in clerenesse.
28749	46	15	42	And so the ayenrisyng of deed men. It is sowun in corrupcioun, it schal rise in vncorrupcioun;
28750	46	15	43	it is sowun in vnnoblei, it schal rise in glorie; it is sowun in infirmyte, it schal rise in vertu;
28751	46	15	44	it is sowun a beestly bodi, it schal rise a spiritual bodi. If ther is a beestli bodi, ther is also a spiritual bodi;
28752	46	15	45	as it is writun, The firste man Adam was maad in to a soule lyuynge, the laste Adam in to a spirit quykenynge.
28753	46	15	46	But the firste is not that that is spiritual, but that that is beestlich, aftirward that that is spiritual.
28754	46	15	47	The firste man of erthe is ertheli; the secounde man of heuene is heuenelich.
28755	46	15	48	Such as the ertheli man is, such ben the ertheli men; and such as the heueneli man is, suche ben also the heueneli men.
28756	46	15	49	Therfor as we han bore the ymage of the ertheli man, bere we also the ymage of the heuenli.
28757	46	15	50	Britheren, Y seie this thing, that fleisch and bloud moun not welde the kyngdom of God, nethir corrupcioun schal welde vncorrupcioun.
28758	46	15	51	Lo! Y seie to you priuyte of hooli thingis. And alle we schulen rise ayen, but not alle we schulen be chaungid;
28759	46	15	52	in a moment, in the twynklyng of an iye, in the laste trumpe; for the trumpe schal sowne, and deed men schulen rise ayen, with oute corrupcioun, and we schulen be chaungid.
28760	46	15	53	For it byhoueth this corruptible thing to clothe vncorrupcioun, and this deedli thing to putte awei vndeedlinesse.
28761	46	15	54	But whanne this deedli thing schal clothe vndeedlynesse, thanne schal the word be doon, that is writun, Deth is sopun vp in victorie.
28762	46	15	55	Deth, where is thi victorie? Deth, where is thi pricke?
28763	46	15	56	But the pricke of deth is synne; and the vertu of synne is the lawe.
28764	46	15	57	But do we thankyngis to God, that yaf to vs victorie bi oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
28765	46	15	58	Therfore, my dereworthe britheren, be ye stidefast, and vnmouable, beynge plenteuouse in werk of the Lord, euere more witynge that youre trauel is not idel in the Lord.
28766	46	16	1	But of the gaderyngis of money that ben maad in to seyntis, as Y ordeynede in the chirchis of Galathie, so also do ye o dai of the wouke.
28767	46	16	2	Ech of you kepe at hym silf, kepynge that that plesith to him, that whanne Y come, the gaderyngis ben not maad.
28768	46	16	3	And whanne Y schal be present, whiche men ye preuen, Y schal sende hem bi epistlis to bere youre grace in to Jerusalem.
28769	46	16	4	That if it be worthi that also Y go, thei schulen go with me.
28770	46	16	5	But Y schal come to you, whanne Y schal passe bi Macedonye; for whi Y schal passe bi Macedonye.
28771	46	16	6	But perauenture Y schal dwelle at you, or also dwelle the wynter, that and ye lede me whidir euere Y schal go.
28772	46	16	7	And Y wole not now se you in my passyng, for Y hope to dwelle with you awhile, if the Lord schal suffre.
28773	46	16	8	But Y schal dwelle at Efesi, `til to Witsuntide.
28774	46	16	9	For a grete dore and an opyn is openyd to me, and many aduersaries.
28775	46	16	10	And if Thimothe come, se ye that he be with out drede with you, for he worcheth the werk of the Lord, as Y.
28776	46	16	11	Therfor no man dispise hym; but lede ye hym forth in pees, that he come to me; for Y abide hym with britheren.
28777	46	16	12	But, britheren, Y make knowun to you of Apollo, that Y preiede him myche, that he schulde come to you, with britheren. But it was not his wille to come now; but he schal come, whanne he schal haue leiser.
28778	46	16	13	Walke ye, and stonde ye in the feith; do ye manli, and be ye coumfortid in the Lord,
28779	46	16	14	and be alle youre thingis don in charite.
28780	46	16	15	And, britheren, Y biseche you, ye knowen the hous of Stephan, and of Fortunati, and Acaicy, for thei ben the firste fruytis of Acaie, and in to mynystrie of seyntis thei han ordeyned hem silf;
28781	46	16	16	that also ye be sugetis to suche, and to ech worchynge togidere and trauelynge.
28782	46	16	17	For Y haue ioie in the presence of Stephan, and of Fortunate, and Acaici;
28783	46	16	18	for thei filliden that thing that failide to you; for thei han refreischid bothe my spirit and youre. Therfor knowe ye hem, that ben suche maner men.
28784	46	16	19	Alle the chirchis of Asie greten you wel. Aquila and Prisca, with her homeli chirche, greten you myche in the Lord, at the whiche also Y am herborid.
28785	46	16	20	Alle bretheren greten you wel. Grete ye wel togidere in hooli cos.
28786	46	16	21	My gretyng bi Poulis hoond.
28787	46	16	22	If ony man loueth not oure Lord Jhesu Crist, be he cursid, Maranatha.
28788	46	16	23	The grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist be with you.
28789	46	16	24	My charite be with you alle in Crist Jhesu oure Lord. Amen.
28790	47	1	1	Poul, apostle of Jhesu Crist, bi the wille of God, and Tymothe, brothir, to the chirche of God that is at Corinthi, with alle seyntis that ben in al Acaie, grace to you,
28791	47	1	2	and pees of God oure fadir and of the Lord Jhesu Crist.
28792	47	1	3	Blessid be God and the fadir of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, fadir of mercies, and God of al coumfort,
28793	47	1	4	which coumfortith vs in al oure tribulacioun, that also we moun coumforte hem, that ben in al diseese, bi the monestyng bi which also we ben monestid of God.
28794	47	1	5	For as the passiouns of Crist ben plenteuouse in vs, so also bi Crist oure coumfort is plenteuouse.
28795	47	1	6	And whether we ben in tribulacioun, for youre tribulacioun and heelthe, ethir we ben coumfortid, for youre coumfort, ethir we ben monestid, for youre monestyng and heelthe. Which worchith in you the suffring of the same passiouns, whiche `we also suffren,
28796	47	1	7	that oure hope be sad for you; witynge for as ye ben felowis of passiouns, so ye schulen ben also of coumfort.
28797	47	1	8	For, britheren, we wolen that ye wite of oure tribulacioun, that was don in Asie; for ouer maner we weren greued ouer myyt, so that it anoiede vs, yhe, to lyue.
28798	47	1	9	But we in vs silf hadden answere of deth, that we truste not in vs, but in God that reisith deed men.
28799	47	1	10	Which delyuerede vs, and delyuerith fro so grete perelis, in to whom we hopen, also yit he schal delyuere,
28800	47	1	11	while also ye helpen in preier for vs; that of the persones of many faces of that yyuyng that is in vs, thankyngis ben don for vs bi many men to God.
28801	47	1	12	For oure glorie is this, the witnessyng of oure conscience, that in symplenesse and clennesse of God, and not in fleischli wisdom, but in the grace of God, we lyueden in this world, but more plenteuousli to you.
28802	47	1	13	And we writen not othere thingis to you, than tho that ye han red and knowe, and Y hope that in to the ende ye schulen knowe,
28803	47	1	14	as also ye han knowe vs a parti; for we ben youre glorie, as also ye ben oure in the dai of oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
28804	47	1	15	And in this tristyng Y wolde first come to you, that ye schulden haue the secounde grace,
28805	47	1	16	and passe bi you in to Macedonye, and eft fro Macedonye come to you, and of you be led in to Judee.
28806	47	1	17	But whanne Y wolde this thing, whether Y vside vnstidfastnesse, ether tho thingis that Y thenke, Y thenke aftir the fleisch, that at me be, it is and it is not?
28807	47	1	18	But God is trewe, for oure word that was at you is and is not, is not ther ynne, but is is in it.
28808	47	1	19	For whi Jhesus Crist, the sone of God, which is prechid among you bi vs, bi me, and Syluan, and Tymothe, ther was not in hym is and is not, but is was in hym.
28809	47	1	20	For whi hou many euer ben biheestis of God, in thilke is, `that is, ben fillid. And therfor and bi hym we seien amen to God, to oure glorie.
28810	47	1	21	Sotheli it is God that confermeth vs with you in Crist, and the which God anoyntide vs,
28811	47	1	22	and which markide vs, and yaf ernes of the spirit in oure hertis.
28812	47	1	23	For Y clepide God to witnesse ayens my soule, that Y sparynge you cam not ouer to Corynthe; not that we ben lordis of youre feith, but we ben helperis of youre ioye; for thorouy bileue ye stonden.
28813	47	2	1	And Y ordeynede this ilke thing at me, that Y schulde not come eftsoone in heuynes to you.
28814	47	2	2	For if Y make you sori, who is he that gladith me, but he that is soreuful of me?
28815	47	2	3	And this same thing Y wroot to you, that whanne Y come, Y haue not sorewe on sorewe, of the whiche it behofte me to haue ioie. And Y triste in you alle, that my ioye is of alle you.
28816	47	2	4	For of myche tribulacioun and angwisch of herte Y wroot to you by many teeris, not that ye be sori, but that ye wite what charite Y haue more plenteuously in you.
28817	47	2	5	For if ony man hath maad me soreuful, he hath not maad me sorewful but a parti, that Y charge not you alle.
28818	47	2	6	This blamyng that ys maad of manye, suffisith to hym, that is sich oon;
28819	47	2	7	so that ayenward ye rathir foryyuen and coumfort, lest perauenture he that is suche a maner man, be sopun vp bi more grete heuynesse.
28820	47	2	8	For which thing Y biseche you, that ye conferme charite in to hym.
28821	47	2	9	For whi therfor Y wroot this, that Y knowe youre preuyng, whether in alle thingis ye ben obedient.
28822	47	2	10	For to whom ye han foryyuen ony thing, also Y haue foryyue. For Y that that Y foryaf, yif Y foryaf ony thing, haue youun for you in the persone of Crist,
28823	47	2	11	that we be not disseyued of Sathanas; for we knowen hise thouytis.
28824	47	2	12	But whanne Y was comun to Troade for the gospel of Crist, and a dore was opened to me in the Lord,
28825	47	2	13	Y hadde not rest to my spirit, for Y foond not my brother Tite, but Y seide to hem farewel, and Y passide in to Macedonye.
28826	47	2	14	And Y do thankyngis to God, that euere more makith vs to haue victorie in Crist Jhesu, and schewith bi vs the odour of his knowing in ech place;
28827	47	2	15	for we ben the good odour of Crist to God, among these that ben maad saaf, and among these that perischen.
28828	47	2	16	To othere sotheli odour of deth in to deth, but to othere we ben odour of lijf in to lijf. And to these thingis who is so able?
28829	47	2	17	For we ben not as many, that don auoutrie bi the word of God, but we speken of clennesse, as of God, bifor God in Crist.
28830	47	3	1	Bigynnen we therfor eftsoone to preise vs silf? or whether we neden, as summen, pistlis of preisinge to you, or of you?
28831	47	3	2	Ye ben oure pistle, writun in oure hertis, which is knowun and red of alle men,
28832	47	3	3	and maad opyn, for ye ben the pistle of Crist mynystrid of vs, and writun, not with enke, but bi the spirit of the lyuynge God; not in stony tablis, but in fleischli tablis of herte.
28833	47	3	4	For we han such trist bi Crist to God;
28834	47	3	5	not that we ben sufficient to thenke ony thing of vs, as of vs, but oure sufficience is of God.
28835	47	3	6	Which also made vs able mynystris of the newe testament, not bi lettre, but bi spirit; for the lettre sleeth, but the spirit quykeneth.
28836	47	3	7	And if the mynystracioun of deth write bi lettris in stoonys was in glorie, so that the children of Israel myyten not biholde in to the face of Moises, for the glorie of his cheer, which is auoidid,
28837	47	3	8	hou schal not the mynystracioun of the spirit be more in glorie?
28838	47	3	9	For if the mynystracioun of dampnacioun was in glorie, myche more the mynysterie of riytwisnesse is plenteuouse in glorie.
28839	47	3	10	For nether that that was cleer was glorified in this part for the excellent glorie; and if that that is auoidid,
28840	47	3	11	was bi glorie, myche more that that dwellith stille is in glorie.
28841	47	3	12	Therfor we that han suche hope, vsen myche trist;
28842	47	3	13	and not as Moises leide a veil on his face, that the children of Israel schulden not biholde in to his face, which veil is auoidid.
28843	47	3	14	But the wittis of hem ben astonyed; for in to this dai the same veil in reding of the olde testament dwellith not schewid, for it is auoidid in Crist, but in to this dai,
28844	47	3	15	whanne Moises is red, the veil is put on her hertis.
28845	47	3	16	But whanne Israel schal be conuertid to God, the veil schal be don awei.
28846	47	3	17	And the spirit is the Lord; and where the spirit of the Lord is, there is fredom.
28847	47	3	18	And alle we that with open face seen the glorie of the Lord, ben transformed in to the same ymage, fro clerenesse in to clerenesse, as of the spirit of the Lord.
28848	47	4	1	Therfor we that han this admynystracioun, aftir this that we han getun merci,
28849	47	4	2	faile we not, but do we awei the preue thingis of schame, not walkinge in sutil gile, nether doynge auoutrye bi the word of God, but in schewynge of the treuthe comendynge vs silf to ech conscience of men bifor God.
28850	47	4	3	For if also oure gospel is kyuerid, in these that perischen it is kyuerid;
28851	47	4	4	in which God hath blent the soulis of vnfeithful men of this world, that the liytnyng of the gospel of the glorie of Crist, which is the ymage of God, schyne not.
28852	47	4	5	But we prechen not vs silf, but oure Lord Jhesu Crist; and vs youre seruauntis bi Jhesu.
28853	47	4	6	For God, that seide liyt to schyne of derknessis, he hath youe liyt in oure hertis, to the liytnyng of the science of the clerenesse of God, in the face of Jhesu Crist.
28854	47	4	7	And we han this tresour in britil vessels, that the worthinesse be of Goddis vertu, and not of vs.
28855	47	4	8	In alle thingis we suffren tribulacioun, but we ben not angwischid, or annoyed; we ben maad pore, but `we lacken nothing; we suffren persecucioun,
28856	47	4	9	but we ben not forsakun; we ben maad lowe, but we ben not confoundid; we ben cast doun, but we perischen not.
28857	47	4	10	And euere more we beren aboute the sleyng of Jhesu in oure bodi, that also the lijf of Jhesu be schewid in oure bodies.
28858	47	4	11	For euere more we that lyuen, ben takun in to deth for Jhesu, that the lijf of Jhesu be schewid in oure deedli fleisch.
28859	47	4	12	Therfor deth worchith in vs, but lijf worchith in you.
28860	47	4	13	And we han the same spirit of feith, as it is writun, Y haue bileuyd, Y haue spoke; and we bileuen, wherfor also we speken;
28861	47	4	14	witynge that he that reiside Jhesu, schal reise also vs with Jhesu, and schal ordeyne with you.
28862	47	4	15	And alle thingis for you, that a plenteuouse grace bi many thankyngis be plenteuouse in to the glorie of God.
28863	47	4	16	For which thing we failen not, for thouy oure vtter man be corruptid; netheles the ynner man is renewid fro dai to dai.
28864	47	4	17	But that liyt thing of oure tribulacioun that lastith now, but as it were by a moment, worchith in vs ouer mesure an euerlastynge birthin in to the heiynesse of glorie;
28865	47	4	18	while that we biholden not tho thingis that ben seyn, but tho that ben not seyn. For tho thingis that ben seyn, ben but durynge for a schort tyme; but tho thingis that ben not seyn, ben euerlastynge.
28866	47	5	1	And we witen, that if oure ertheli hous of this dwellynge be dissoluyd, that we han a bildyng of God, an hous not maad bi hondis, euerlastynge in heuenes.
28867	47	5	2	For whi in this thing we mornen, coueitynge to be clothid aboue with oure dwellyng, which is of heuene; if netheles we ben foundun clothid,
28868	47	5	3	and not nakid.
28869	47	5	4	For whi and we that ben in this tabernacle, sorewen with ynne, and ben heuyed, for that we wolen not be spuylid, but be clothid aboue; that the ilke thing that is deedli, be sopun vp of lijf.
28870	47	5	5	But who is it that makith vs in to this same thing? God, that yaf to vs the ernes of the spirit.
28871	47	5	6	Therfor we ben hardi algatis, and witen that the while we ben in this bodi, we goen in pilgrymage fro the Lord;
28872	47	5	7	for we walken bi feith, and not bi cleer siyt.
28873	47	5	8	But we ben hardi, and han good wille, more to be in pilgrymage fro the bodi, and to be present to God.
28874	47	5	9	And therfor we stryuen, whether absent, whether present, to plese hym.
28875	47	5	10	For it bihoueth vs alle to be schewid bifor the trone of Crist, that euery man telle the propre thingis of the bodi, as he hath don, ethir good, ether yuel.
28876	47	5	11	Therfor we witynge the drede of the Lord, councelen men, for to God we ben opyn; and Y hope, that we ben opyn also in youre consciencis.
28877	47	5	12	We comenden not vs silf eftsoone to you, but we yyuen to you occasioun to haue glorie for vs, that ye haue to hem that glorien in the face, and not in the herte.
28878	47	5	13	For ethir we bi mynde passen to God, ether we ben sobre to you.
28879	47	5	14	For the charite of Crist dryueth vs; gessynge this thing, that if oon died for alle, thanne alle weren deed.
28880	47	5	15	And Crist diede for alle, that thei that lyuen, lyue not now to hem silf, but to hym that diede for hem, and roos ayen.
28881	47	5	16	Therfor we fro this tyme knowen no man aftir the fleische; thouy we knowun Crist aftir the fleisch, but nowe we knowun not.
28882	47	5	17	Therfor if ony newe creature is in Crist, the elde thingis ben passid.
28883	47	5	18	And lo! alle thingis ben of God, which recounselide vs to hym bi Crist, and yaf to vs the seruyce of recounselyng.
28884	47	5	19	And God was in Crist, recounselynge to hym the world, not rettynge to hem her giltes, and puttide in vs the word of recounselyng.
28885	47	5	20	Therfor we vsen message for Crist, as if God monestith bi vs; we bisechen for Crist, be ye recounselid to God.
28886	47	5	21	God the fadir made hym synne for vs, which knewe not synne, that we schulden be maad riytwisnesse of God in hym.
28887	47	6	1	But we helpynge monesten, that ye resseyuen not the grace of God in veyn.
28888	47	6	2	For he seith, In tyme wel plesinge Y haue herd thee, and in the dai of heelthe Y haue helpid thee. Lo! now a tyme acceptable, lo! now a dai of heelthe.
28889	47	6	3	Yyue we to no man ony offencioun, that oure seruyce be not repreued;
28890	47	6	4	but in alle thingis yyue we vs silf as the mynystris of God, in myche pacience, in tribulaciouns,
28891	47	6	5	in nedis, in angwischis, in betyngis, in prisouns, in dissensiouns with ynne, in trauels, in wakyngis, in fastyngis,
28892	47	6	6	in chastite, in kunnyng, in long abiding, in swetnesse, in the Hooli Goost,
28893	47	6	7	in charite not feined, in the word of treuthe, in the vertu of God; bi armeris of riytwisnesse on the riythalf and on the lefthalf;
28894	47	6	8	bi glorie and vnnoblei; bi yuel fame and good fame; as disseyueris, and trewe men; as thei that ben vnknowun, and knowun;
28895	47	6	9	as men diynge, and lo! we lyuen; as chastisid, and not maad deed;
28896	47	6	10	as sorewful, euere more ioiynge; as hauynge nede, but makynge many men riche; as no thing hauynge, and weldynge alle thingis.
28897	47	6	11	A! ye Corynthies, oure mouth is open to you, oure herte is alargid;
28898	47	6	12	ye ben not angwischid in vs, but ye ben anguischid in youre inwardnessis.
28899	47	6	13	And Y seie as to sones, ye that han the same reward, be ye alargid.
28900	47	6	14	Nyle ye bere the yok with vnfeithful men. For what parting of riytwisnes with wickidnesse? or what felouschipe of liyt to derknessis?
28901	47	6	15	and what acording of Crist to Belial? or what part of a feithful with the vnfeithful?
28902	47	6	16	and what consent to the temple of God with mawmetis? And ye ben the temple of the lyuynge God, as the Lord seith, For Y schal dwelle in hem, and Y schal walke among hem; and Y schal be God of hem, and thei schulen be a puple to me.
28903	47	6	17	For which thing go ye out of the myddil of hem, and be ye departid, seith the Lord, and touche ye not vnclene thing;
28904	47	6	18	and Y schal resseyue you, and schal be to you in to a fadir, and ye schulen be to me in to sones and douytris, seith the Lord almyyti.
28905	47	7	1	Therfor, most dereworthe britheren, we that han these biheestis, clense we vs fro al filthe of the fleische and of the spirit, doynge holynesse in the drede of God.
28906	47	7	2	Take ye vs; we han hirt no man, we han apeirid no man, we han bigilid no man.
28907	47	7	3	Y seie not to youre condempnyng; for Y seide bifor, that ye ben in youre hertis, to die togidere and to lyue togidere.
28908	47	7	4	Myche trist is to me anentis you, myche gloriyng is to me for you. Y am fillid with coumfort, Y am plenteuouse in ioie in al oure tribulacioun.
28909	47	7	5	For whanne we weren comun to Macedonye, oure fleisch hadde no reste, but we suffriden al tribulacioun; with outforth fiytingis, and dredis with ynne.
28910	47	7	6	But God that coumfortith meke men, coumfortide vs in the comyng of Tite.
28911	47	7	7	And not oneli in the comyng of him, but also in the coumfort bi which he was coumfortid in you, tellinge to vs youre desire, youre weping, youre loue for me, so that Y ioiede more.
28912	47	7	8	For thouy Y made you sorie in a pistle, it rewith me not; thouy it rewide, seynge that thouy thilke pistle made you sori at an our, now Y haue ioie;
28913	47	7	9	not for ye weren maad soreuful, but for ye weren maad soreuful to penaunce. For whi ye ben maad sori aftir God, that in no thing ye suffre peirement of vs.
28914	47	7	10	For the sorewe that is aftir God, worchith penaunce in to stidfast heelthe; but sorewe of the world worchith deth.
28915	47	7	11	For lo! this same thing, that ye ben soreuful aftir God, hou myche bisynesse it worchith in you; but defendyng, but indignacioun, but drede, but desire, but loue, but veniaunce. In alle thingis ye han youun you silf to be vndefoulid in the cause.
28916	47	7	12	Therfor thouy Y wroot to you, Y wroot not for hym that dide the iniurie, nether for hym that suffride, but to schewe oure bisinesse, which we han for you bifor God.
28917	47	7	13	Therfor we ben coumfortid, but in youre coumfort more plenteuousli we ioyeden more on the ioie of Tite, for his spirit is fulfillid of alle you.
28918	47	7	14	And if Y gloriede ony thing anentis hym of you, Y am not confoundid; but as we han spoke to you alle thingis, so also oure glorie that was at Tite, is maad treuthe.
28919	47	7	15	And the inwardnesse of hym be more plenteuousli in you, which hath in mynde the obedience of you alle, hou with drede and trembling ye resseyueden hym.
28920	47	7	16	Y haue ioye, that in alle thingis Y triste in you.
28921	47	8	1	But, britheren, we maken knowun to you the grace of God, that is youun in the chirchis of Macedonye,
28922	47	8	2	that in myche asaiyng of tribulacioun, the plente of the ioye of hem was, and the hiyeste pouert of hem was plenteuouse `in to the richessis of the symplenesse of hem.
28923	47	8	3	For Y bere witnessyng to hem, aftir miyt and aboue miyt thei weren wilful,
28924	47	8	4	with myche monestyng bisechynge vs the grace and the comynyng of mynystring, that is maad to hooli men.
28925	47	8	5	And not as we hopiden, but thei yauen hem silf first to the Lord, aftirward to vs bi the wille of God.
28926	47	8	6	So that we preyeden Tite, that as he bigan, so also he performe in you this grace.
28927	47	8	7	But as ye abounden in alle thingis, in feith, and word, and kunnyng, and al bisynesse, more ouer and in youre charite in to vs, that and in this grace ye abounden.
28928	47	8	8	Y seie not as comaundinge, but bi the bisynesse of othere men appreuynge also the good wit of youre charite.
28929	47	8	9	And ye witen the grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, for he was maad nedi for you, whanne he was riche, that ye schulden be maad riche bi his nedynesse.
28930	47	8	10	And Y yyue counsel in this thing; for this is profitable to you, that not oneli han bigunne to do, but also ye bigunnen to haue wille fro the formere yere.
28931	47	8	11	But now parfourme ye in deed, that as the discrecioun of wille is redi, so be it also of parformyng of that that ye han.
28932	47	8	12	For if the wille be redi, it is acceptid aftir that that it hath, not aftir that that it hath not.
28933	47	8	13	And not that it be remyssioun to othere men, and to you tribulacioun;
28934	47	8	14	but of euenesse in the present tyme youre aboundance fulfille the myseese of hem, that also the aboundaunce of hem be a fulfillynge of youre myseise, that euenesse be maad; as it is writun,
28935	47	8	15	He that gaderide myche, was not encresid, and he that gaderide litil, hadde not lesse.
28936	47	8	16	And Y do thankyngis to God, that yaf the same bisynesse for you in the herte of Tite,
28937	47	8	17	for he resseyuede exortacioun; but whanne he was bisier, bi his wille he wente forth to you.
28938	47	8	18	And we senten with hym a brother, whose preisyng is in the gospel bi alle chirchis.
28939	47	8	19	And not oneli, but also he is ordeyned of chirchis the felowe of oure pilgrimage in to this grace, that is mynystrid of vs to the glorie of the Lord, and to oure ordeyned wille;
28940	47	8	20	eschewynge this thing, that no man blame vs in this plente, that is mynystrid of vs to the glorye of the Lord.
28941	47	8	21	For we purueyen good thingis, not onely bifor God, but also bifor alle men.
28942	47	8	22	For we senten with hem also oure brothir, whom we han preued in many thingis ofte, that he was bisi, but nowe myche bisier, for myche trist in you,
28943	47	8	23	ethir for Tite, that is my felowe and helpere in you, ethir for oure britheren, apostlis of the chirches of the glorie of Crist.
28944	47	8	24	Therfor schewe ye in to hem in the face of chirchis, that schewynge that is of youre charite and of oure glorie for you.
28945	47	9	1	For of the mynystrie that is maad to hooli men, it is to me of plente to write to you.
28946	47	9	2	For Y knowe youre wille, for the which Y haue glorie of you anentis Macedonyes, for also Acaie is redi fro a yeer passid, and youre loue hath stirid ful manye.
28947	47	9	3	And we han sent britheren, that this thing that we glorien of you, be not auoidid in this parti, that as Y seide, ye be redi.
28948	47	9	4	Lest whanne Macedonyes comen with me, and fynden you vnredi, we be schamed, that we seien you not, in this substaunce.
28949	47	9	5	Therfor Y gesside necessarie to preie britheren, that thei come bifore to you, and make redi this bihiyt blessyng to be redi, so as blessing, and not as aueryce.
28950	47	9	6	For Y seie this thing, he that sowith scarseli, schal also repe scarseli; and he that sowith in blessyngis, schal `repe also of blessyngis.
28951	47	9	7	Ech man as he castide in his herte, not of heuynesse, or of nede; for God loueth a glad yyuere.
28952	47	9	8	And God is miyti to make al grace abounde in you, that ye in alle thingis euere more han al sufficience, and abounde in to al good werk;
28953	47	9	9	as it is writun, He delide abrood, he yaf to pore men, his riytwisnesse dwellith withouten ende.
28954	47	9	10	And he that mynystrith seed to the sowere, schal yyue also breed to ete, and he schal multiplie youre seed, and make myche the encreessingis of fruytis of youre riytwisnesse;
28955	47	9	11	that in alle thingis ye maad riche waxen plenteuouse in to al symplenesse, which worchith bi vs doing of thankingis to God.
28956	47	9	12	For the mynystrie of this office not oneli fillith tho thingis that failen to holi men, but also multiplieth many thankyngis to God,
28957	47	9	13	bi the preuyng of this mynystrie, which glorifien God in the obedience of youre knouleching in the gospel of Crist, and in symplenesse of comynycacioun in to hem and in to alle,
28958	47	9	14	and in the biseching of hem for you, that desiren you for the excellent grace of God in you.
28959	47	9	15	Y do thankyngis to God of the yifte of hym, that may not be teld.
28960	47	10	1	And Y my silf Poul biseche you, bi the myldenesse and softnesse of Crist, which in the face am meke among you, and Y absent triste in you.
28961	47	10	2	For Y preie you, that lest Y present be not bold bi the trist, in which Y am gessid to be bold in to summe, that demen vs, as if we wandren aftir the fleisch.
28962	47	10	3	For we walkynge in fleisch, fiyten not aftir the fleisch.
28963	47	10	4	For the armuris of oure knyythod ben not fleischli, but myyti bi God to the distruccioun of strengthis. And we distrien counsels,
28964	47	10	5	and alle hiynesse that hiyeth it silf ayens the science of God, and dryuen `in to caitifte al vndirstonding in to the seruyce of Crist.
28965	47	10	6	And we han redi to venge al vnobedience, whanne youre obedience schal be fillid.
28966	47	10	7	Se ye the thingis that ben after the face. If ony man trustith to him silf, that he is of Crist, thenke he this thing eft anentis hym silf,
28967	47	10	8	for as he is Cristis, so also we. For if Y schal glorie ony thing more of oure power, which the Lord yaf to vs in to edifiyng, and not in to youre distruccioun, Y schal not be schamed.
28968	47	10	9	But that Y be not gessid as to fere you bi epistlis,
28969	47	10	10	for thei seien, That epistlis ben greuouse and stronge, but the presence of the bodi is feble, and the word worthi to be dispisid.
28970	47	10	11	He that is suche oon, thenke this, for suche as we absent ben in word bi pistlis, suche we ben present in dede.
28971	47	10	12	For we doren not putte vs among, or comparisoune vs to summen, that comenden hem silf; but we mesuren vs in vs silf, and comparisounen vs silf to vs.
28972	47	10	13	For we schulen not haue glorie ouer mesure, but bi the mesure of the reule which God mesuride to vs, the mesure that stretchith to you.
28973	47	10	14	For we ouerstretchen not forth vs, as not stretchinge to you. For to you we camen in the gospel of Crist,
28974	47	10	15	not gloriynge ouer mesure in othere mennus trauelis. For we `han hope of youre feith that wexith in you to be magnefied bi oure reule in abundaunce,
28975	47	10	16	also to preche in to tho thingis that ben biyendis you, not to haue glorie in othere mennus reule, in these thingis that ben maad redi.
28976	47	10	17	He that glorieth, haue glorie in the Lord.
28977	47	10	18	For not he that comendith hym silf is preuyd, but whom God comendith.
28978	47	11	1	I wolde that ye wolden suffre a litil thing of myn vnwisdom, but also supporte ye me.
28979	47	11	2	For Y loue you bi the loue of God; for Y haue spousid you to oon hosebonde, to yelde a chast virgyn to Crist.
28980	47	11	3	But Y drede, lest as the serpent disseyuede Eue with his sutil fraude, so youre wittis ben corrupt, and fallen doun fro the symplenesse that is in Crist.
28981	47	11	4	For if he that cometh, prechith anothir Crist, whom we precheden not, or if ye taken another spirit, whom ye token not, or another gospel, which ye resseyueden not, riytli ye schulden suffre.
28982	47	11	5	For Y wene that Y haue don no thing lesse than the grete apostlis.
28983	47	11	6	For thouy Y be vnlerud in word, but not in kunnyng. For in alle thingis Y am open to you.
28984	47	11	7	Or whether Y haue don synne, mekynge my silf, that ye be enhaunsid, for freli Y prechide to you the gospel of God?
28985	47	11	8	Y made nakid othere chirchis, and Y took sowde to youre seruyce.
28986	47	11	9	And whanne Y was among you, and hadde nede, Y was chargeouse to no man; for britheren that camen fro Macedonye, fulfilliden that that failide to me. And in alle thingis Y haue kept, and schal kepe me with outen charge to you.
28987	47	11	10	The treuthe of Crist is in me; for this glorie schal not be brokun in me in the cuntreis of Acaie.
28988	47	11	11	Whi? for Y loue not you?
28989	47	11	12	God woot. For that that Y do, and that Y schal do, is that Y kitte awei the occasioun of hem that wolen occasioun, that in the thing, in which thei glorien, thei be foundun as we.
28990	47	11	13	For siche false apostlis ben trecherouse werk men, and transfiguren hem in to apostlis of Crist.
28991	47	11	14	And no wondur, for Sathanas hym silf transfigurith hym in to an aungel of light.
28992	47	11	15	Therfor it is not greet, if hise mynystris ben transfigurid as the mynystris of riytwisnesse, whos ende schal be aftir her werkis.
28993	47	11	16	Eft Y seie, lest ony man gesse me to be vnwise; ellis take ye me as vnwise, that also Y haue glorie a litil what.
28994	47	11	17	That that Y speke, Y speke not aftir God, but as in vnwisdom, in this substaunce of glorie.
28995	47	11	18	For many men glorien aftir the fleisch, and Y schal glorie.
28996	47	11	19	For ye suffren gladli vnwise men, whanne ye silf ben wise.
28997	47	11	20	For ye susteynen, if ony man dryueth you in to seruage, if ony man deuourith, if ony man takith, if ony man is enhaunsid, if ony man smytith you on the face.
28998	47	11	21	Bi vnnoblei Y seie, as if we weren sike in this parti. In what thing ony man dar, in vnwisdom Y seie, and Y dar.
28999	47	11	22	Thei ben Ebrewis, and Y; thei ben Israelitis, and Y; thei ben the seed of Abraham, and Y;
29000	47	11	23	thei ben the mynystris of Crist, and Y. As lesse wise Y seie, Y more; in ful many trauelis, in prisouns more plenteuousli, in woundis aboue maner, in deethis ofte tymes.
29001	47	11	24	Y resseyuede of the Jewis fyue sithis fourti strokis oon lesse;
29002	47	11	25	thries Y was betun with yerdis, onys Y was stonyd, thries Y was at shipbreche, a nyyt and a dai Y was in the depnesse of the see;
29003	47	11	26	in weies ofte, in perelis of floodis, in perelis of theues, in perelis of kyn, in perelis of hethene men, in perelis in citee, in perelis in desert, in perelis in the see, in perelis among false britheren, in trauel and nedynesse,
29004	47	11	27	in many wakyngis, in hungur, in thirst, in many fastyngis, in coold and nakidnesse.
29005	47	11	28	Withouten tho thingis that ben withoutforth, myn ech daies trauelyng is the bisynesse of alle chirchis.
29006	47	11	29	Who is sijk, and Y am not sijk? who is sclaundrid, and Y am not brent?
29007	47	11	30	If it bihoueth to glorie, Y schal glorie in tho thingis that ben of myn infirmyte.
29008	47	11	31	God and the fadir of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, that is blessid in to worldis, woot that Y lie not.
29009	47	11	32	The preuost of Damask, of the kyng of the folk Arethe, kepte the citee of Damascenes to take me;
29010	47	11	33	and bi a wyndow in a leep Y was latun doun bi the wal, and so Y ascapide hise hondis.
29011	47	12	1	If it bihoueth to haue glorie, it spedith not; but Y schal come to the visiouns and to the reuelaciouns of the Lord.
29012	47	12	2	I woot a man in Crist that bifore fouretene yeer; whether in bodi, whether out of the bodi, Y woot not, God woot; that siche a man was rauyschid `til to the thridde heuene.
29013	47	12	3	And Y woot sich a man; whether in bodi, or out of bodi, Y noot, God woot;
29014	47	12	4	that he was rauyschid in to paradis, and herde preuy wordis, whiche it is not leueful to a man to speke.
29015	47	12	5	For such maner thingis Y schal glorie; but for me no thing, no but in myn infirmytees.
29016	47	12	6	For if Y schal wilne to glorie, Y schal not be vnwijs, for Y schal seie treuthe; but Y spare, lest ony man gesse me ouer that thing that he seeth in me, or herith ony thing of me.
29017	47	12	7	And lest the greetnesse of reuelaciouns enhaunse me in pride, the pricke of my fleisch, an aungel of Sathanas, is youun to me, that he buffate me.
29018	47	12	8	For whiche thing thries Y preiede the Lord, that it schulde go awei fro me.
29019	47	12	9	And he seide to me, My grace suffisith to thee; for vertu is parfitli maad in infirmyte. Therfor gladli Y schal glorie in myn infirmytees, that the vertu of Crist dwelle in me.
29020	47	12	10	For which thing Y am plesid in myn infirmytees, in dispisyngis, in nedis, in persecuciouns, in anguyschis, for Crist; for whanne Y am sijk, thanne Y am miyti.
29021	47	12	11	Y am maad vnwitti, ye constreyneden me. For Y ouyte to be comendid of you; for Y dide no thing lesse than thei that ben apostlis `aboue maner.
29022	47	12	12	Thouy Y am nouyt, netheles the signes of myn apostilhed ben maad on you, in al pacience, and signes, and grete wondris, and vertues.
29023	47	12	13	And what is it, that ye hadden lesse than othere chirchis, but that Y my silf greuyde you not? Foryyue ye to me this wrong.
29024	47	12	14	Lo! this thridde tyme Y am redi to come to you, and Y schal not be greuous to you; for Y seke not tho thingis that ben youre, but you. For nether sones owen to tresoure to fadir and modir, but the fadir and modir to the sones.
29025	47	12	15	For Y schal yyue moost wilfuli, and Y my silf schal be youun aboue for youre soulis; thouy Y more loue you, and be lesse louyd.
29026	47	12	16	But be it; Y greuyde not you, but whanne Y was sutil, Y took you with gile.
29027	47	12	17	Whether Y disseyuede you bi ony of hem, which Y sente to you?
29028	47	12	18	Y preiede Tite, and Y sente with hym a brother. Whether Tite begilide you? whether we yeden not in the same spirit? whether not in the same steppis?
29029	47	12	19	Sum tyme ye wenen, that we schulen excuse vs anentis you. Bifor God in Crist we speken; and, moost dere britheren, alle thingis for youre edifiyng.
29030	47	12	20	But Y drede, lest whanne Y come, Y schal fynde you not suche as Y wole, and Y schal be foundun of you suche as ye wolen not; lest perauenture stryuyngis, enuyes, sturdynessis, dissenciouns and detraccions, preuy spechis of discord, bolnyngis bi pride, debatis ben among you;
29031	47	12	21	and lest eftsoone whanne Y come, God make me low anentis you, and Y biweile many of hem, that bifor synneden, and diden not penaunce on the vnclennesse, and fornicacioun, and vnchastite, that thei han don.
29032	47	13	1	Lo! this thridde tyme Y come to you, and in the mouth of tweyne or of thre witnessis euery word schal stonde.
29033	47	13	2	Y seide bifor, and seie bifor, as present twies, and now absent, to hem that bifor han synned, and to alle othere; for if Y come eftsoone, Y schal not spare.
29034	47	13	3	Whether ye seken the preef of that Crist, that spekith in me, which is not feble in you?
29035	47	13	4	For thouy he was crucified of infirmyte, but he lyueth of the vertu of God. For also we ben sijk in hym, but we schulen lyue with him of the vertu of God in vs.
29036	47	13	5	Asaie you silf, if ye ben in the feith; ye you silf preue. Whether ye knowen not you silf, for Crist Jhesu is in you? but in happe ye ben repreuable.
29037	47	13	6	But Y hope, that ye knowen, that we ben not repreuable.
29038	47	13	7	And we preien the Lord, that ye do no thing of yuel; not that we seme preued, but that ye do that that is good, and that we ben as repreuable.
29039	47	13	8	For we moun no thing ayens treuthe, but for the treuthe.
29040	47	13	9	For we ioyen, whanne we ben sijk, but ye ben myyti; and we preien this thing, youre perfeccioun.
29041	47	13	10	Therfor Y absent write these thingis, that Y present do not hardere, bi the powere, which the Lord yaf to me in to edificacioun, and not in to youre distruccioun.
29042	47	13	11	Britheren, `hennus forward ioye ye, be ye perfit, excite ye; vndurstonde ye the same thing; haue ye pees, and God of pees and of loue schal be with you.
29043	47	13	12	Grete ye wel togidere in hooli cos. Alle hooli men greten you wel.
29044	47	13	13	The grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, and the charite of God, and the comynyng of the Hooli Gost, be with `you alle. Amen.
29045	48	1	1	Poul the apostle, not of men, ne bi man, but bi Jhesu Crist, and God the fadir,
29046	48	1	2	that reiside hym fro deth, and alle the britheren that ben with me, to the chirchis of Galathie,
29047	48	1	3	grace to you and pees of God the fadir, and of the Lord Jhesu Crist,
29048	48	1	4	that yaf hym silf for oure synnes, to delyuere vs fro the present wickid world, bi the wille of God and of oure fadir,
29049	48	1	5	to whom is worschip and glorie in to worldis of worldis. Amen.
29050	48	1	6	I wondur, that so soone ye be thus moued fro hym that clepid you in to the grace of Crist, in to another euangelie; which is not anothir,
29051	48	1	7	but that ther ben summe that troublen you, and wolen mysturne the euangelie of Crist.
29052	48	1	8	But thouy we, or an aungel of heuene, prechide to you, bisidis that that we han prechid to you, be he acursid.
29053	48	1	9	As Y haue seid bifore, and now eftsoones Y seie, if ony preche to you bisidis that that ye han vndurfongun, be he cursid.
29054	48	1	10	For now whether counsele Y men, or God? or whether Y seche to plese men? If Y pleside yit men, Y were not Cristis seruaunt.
29055	48	1	11	For, britheren, Y make knowun to you the euangelie, that was prechid of me, for it is not bi man;
29056	48	1	12	ne Y took it of man, ne lernyde, but bi reuelacioun of Jhesu Crist.
29057	48	1	13	For ye han herd my conuersacioun sumtyme in the Jurie, and that Y pursuede passyngli the chirche of God, and fauyt ayen it.
29058	48	1	14	And Y profitide in the Jurie aboue many of myn eueneldis in my kynrede, and was more aboundauntli a folewere of my fadris tradiciouns.
29059	48	1	15	But whanne it pleside hym, that departide me fro my modir wombe,
29060	48	1	16	and clepide bi his grace, to schewe his sone in me, that Y schulde preche hym among the hethene, anoon Y drowy me not to fleisch and blood; ne Y cam to Jerusalem to the apostlis,
29061	48	1	17	that weren tofor me, but Y wente in to Arabie, and eftsoones Y turnede ayen in to Damask.
29062	48	1	18	And sith thre yeer aftir Y cam to Jerusalem, to se Petre, and Y dwellide with hym fiftene daies;
29063	48	1	19	but Y sawy noon othere of the apostlis, but James, oure Lordis brother.
29064	48	1	20	And these thingis which Y write to you, lo! tofor God Y lie not.
29065	48	1	21	Afterward Y cam in to the coostis of Syrie and Cilicie.
29066	48	1	22	But Y was vnknowun bi face to the chirchis of Judee, that weren in Crist; and thei hadden oonli an heryng,
29067	48	1	23	that he that pursuede vs sum tyme, prechide now the feith, ayens which he fauyte sum tyme;
29068	48	1	24	and in me thei glorifieden God.
29069	48	2	1	And sith fourtene yeer aftir, eftsones Y wente vp to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took with me Tite.
29070	48	2	2	Y wente vp bi reuelacioun, and spak with hem the euangelie, which Y preche among the hethene; and bi hem silf to these that semeden to be sumwhat, lest Y runne, or hadde runne in veyne.
29071	48	2	3	And nother Tite, that hadde be with me, while he was hethene, was compellid to be circumsidid;
29072	48	2	4	but for false britheren that weren brouyt ynne, whiche hadden entrid to aspie oure fredom, which we han in Jhesu Crist, to bring vs in to seruage.
29073	48	2	5	But we yyue no place to subieccioun, that the treuthe of the gospel schulde dwelle with you.
29074	48	2	6	But of these that semeden to be sumwhat; whiche thei weren sum tyme, it perteyneth not to me, for God takith not the persoone of man; for thei that semeden to be sumwhat, yauen me no thing.
29075	48	2	7	But ayenward, whanne thei hadden seyn, that the euangelie of prepucie was youun to me, as the euangelie of circumcisioun was youun to Petre;
29076	48	2	8	for he that wrouyte to Petre in apostlehed of circumcisioun, wrouyte also to me among the hethene;
29077	48	2	9	and whanne thei hadden knowe the grace of God, that was youun to me, James, and Petre, and Joon, whiche weren seyn to be the pileris, thei yauen riythond of felowschip to me and to Barnabas, that we among the hethene, and thei in to circumcisioun;
29078	48	2	10	oneli that we hadde mynde of pore men `of Crist, the which thing Y was ful bisi to doon.
29079	48	2	11	But whanne Petre was comun to Antioche, Y ayenstood hym in the face, for he was worthi to be vndirnommen.
29080	48	2	12	For bifor that ther camen summen fro James, he eete with the hethene men; but whanne thei weren comun, he withdrowy, and departide hym, dredinge hem that weren of circumcisioun.
29081	48	2	13	And the othere Jewis assentiden to his feynyng, so that Barnabas was drawun of hem in to that feynyng.
29082	48	2	14	But whanne Y sawy, that thei walkiden not riytli to the treuthe of the gospel, Y seide to Petre bifor alle men, If thou, that art a Jew, lyuest hethenlich, and not Jewelich, hou constreynest thou hethene men to bicome Jewis?
29083	48	2	15	We Jewis of kynde, and not synful men of the hethene,
29084	48	2	16	knowen that a man is not iustified of the werkis of lawe, but bi the feith of Jhesu Crist; and we bileuen in Jhesu Crist, that we ben iustified of the feith of Crist, and not of the werkis of lawe. Wherfor of the werkis of lawe ech fleisch schal not be iustified.
29085	48	2	17	And if we sechen to be iustified in Crist, we oure silf ben foundun synful men, whether Crist be mynystre of synne?
29086	48	2	18	God forbede. And if Y bylde ayen thingis that Y haue distruyed, Y make my silf a trespassour.
29087	48	2	19	For bi the lawe Y am deed to the lawe, and Y am fitchid to the crosse, that Y lyue to God with Crist.
29088	48	2	20	And now lyue not Y, but Crist lyueth in me. But that Y lyue now in fleisch, Y lyue in the feith of Goddis sone, that louede me, and yaf hym silf for me.
29089	48	2	21	Y caste not awey the grace of God; for if riytwisnesse be thoruy lawe, thanne Crist diede with out cause.
29090	48	3	1	Vnwitti Galathies, tofor whos iyen Jhesu Crist is exilid, and is crucified in you, who hath disseyued you, that ye obeyen not to treuthe?
29091	48	3	2	This oneli Y wilne to lerne of you, whether ye han vndurfonge the spirit of werkis of the lawe, or of heryng of bileue?
29092	48	3	3	So ye ben foolis, that whanne ye han bigunne in spirit, ye ben endid in fleisch.
29093	48	3	4	So grete thingis ye han suffrid without cause, if it be withoute cause.
29094	48	3	5	He that yyueth to you spirit, and worchith vertues in you, whether of werkis of the lawe, or of hering of bileue?
29095	48	3	6	As it is writun, Abraham bileuede to God, and it was rettid to hym to riytfulnesse.
29096	48	3	7	And therfor knowe ye, that these that ben of bileue, ben the sones of Abraham.
29097	48	3	8	And the scripture seynge afer, that God iustifieth the hethene, of bileue told tofor to Abraham, That in thee alle the hethene schulen be blessid.
29098	48	3	9	And therfor these that ben of bileue, schulen be blessid with feithful Abraham.
29099	48	3	10	For alle that ben of the werkis of the lawe, ben vndur curse; for it is writun, Ech man is cursid, that abidith not in alle thingis that ben writun in the book of the lawe, to do tho thingis.
29100	48	3	11	And that no man is iustified in the lawe bifor God, it is opyn, for a riytful man lyueth of bileue.
29101	48	3	12	But the lawe is not of bileue, but he that doith tho thingis of the lawe, schal lyue in hem.
29102	48	3	13	But Crist ayenbouyte us fro the curse of the lawe, and was maad acursid for vs; for it is writun, Ech man is cursid that hangith in the tre;
29103	48	3	14	that among the hethene the blessyng of Abraham were maad in `Crist Jhesu, that we vndurfonge the biheeste of spirit thoruy bileue.
29104	48	3	15	Britheren, Y seie aftir man, no man dispisith the testament of a man that is confermed, or ordeyneth aboue.
29105	48	3	16	The biheestis weren seid to Abraham and to his seed; he seith not, In seedis, as in many, but as in oon, And to thi seed, that is, Crist.
29106	48	3	17	But Y seie, this testament is confermed of God; the lawe that was maad after foure hundrid and thritti yeer, makith not the testament veyn to auoide awei the biheest.
29107	48	3	18	For if eritage were of the lawe, it were not now of biheeste. But God grauntide to Abraham thoruy biheest.
29108	48	3	19	What thanne the lawe? It was sett for trespassing, to the seed come, to whom he hadde maad his biheest. Whiche lawe was ordeyned bi aungels, in the hoond of a mediatour. But a mediatour is not of oon. But God is oon.
29109	48	3	21	Is thanne the lawe ayens the biheestis of God? God forbede. For if the lawe were youun, that myyte quikene, verili were riytfulnesse of lawe.
29110	48	3	22	But scripture hath concludid alle thingis vndir synne, that the biheeste of the feith of Jhesu Crist were yyuen to hem that bileuen.
29111	48	3	23	And tofor that bileue cam, thei weren kept vndur the lawe, enclosid in to that bileue that was to be schewid.
29112	48	3	24	And so the lawe was oure vndirsmaister in Crist, that we ben iustified of bileue.
29113	48	3	25	But aftir that bileue cam, we ben not now vndur the vndurmaistir.
29114	48	3	26	For alle ye ben the children of God thoruy the bileue of Jhesu Crist.
29115	48	3	27	For alle ye that ben baptisid, ben clothid with Crist.
29116	48	3	28	Ther is no Jewe, ne Greke, ne bond man, ne fre man, ne male, ne female; for alle ye ben oon in `Jhesu Crist.
29117	48	3	29	And if ye ben oon in `Jhesu Crist, thanne ye ben the seed of Abraham, and eiris bi biheest.
29118	48	4	1	But Y seie, as long tyme as the eir is a litil child, he dyuersith no thing fro a seruaunt, whanne he is lord of alle thingis;
29119	48	4	2	but he is vndur keperis and tutoris, in to the tyme determyned of the fadir.
29120	48	4	3	So we, whanne we weren litle children, we serueden vndur the elementis of the world.
29121	48	4	4	But aftir that the fulfilling of tyme cam, God sente his sone,
29122	48	4	5	maad of a womman, maad vndur the lawe, that he schulde ayenbie hem that weren vndur the lawe, that we schulden vnderfonge the adopcioun of sones.
29123	48	4	6	And for ye ben Goddis sones, God sente his spirit in to youre hertis, criynge, Abba, fadir.
29124	48	4	7	And so ther is not now a seruaunt, but a sone; and if he is a sone, he is an eir bi God.
29125	48	4	8	But thanne ye vnknowynge God, serueden to hem that in kynde weren not goddis.
29126	48	4	9	But now whanne ye han knowe God, and ben knowun of God, hou ben ye turned eftsoone to the febil and nedi elementis, to the whiche ye wolen eft serue?
29127	48	4	10	Ye taken kepe to daies, and monethis, and tymes, and yeris.
29128	48	4	11	But Y drede you, lest without cause Y haue trauelid among you.
29129	48	4	12	Be ye as Y, for Y am as ye. Britheren, Y biseche you, ye han hurt me no thing.
29130	48	4	13	But ye knowen, that bi infirmyte of fleisch Y haue prechid to you now bifore;
29131	48	4	14	and ye dispiseden not, nether forsoken youre temptacioun in my fleisch, but ye resseyueden me as an aungel of God, as `Crist Jhesu.
29132	48	4	15	Where thanne is youre blessyng? For Y bere you witnesse, that if it myyte haue be don. ye wolden haue put out youre iyen, and haue yyuen hem to me.
29133	48	4	16	Am Y thanne maad an enemye to you, seiynge to you the sothe?
29134	48	4	17	Thei louen not you wel, but thei wolen exclude you, that ye suen hem.
29135	48	4	18	But sue ye the good euermore in good, and not oneli whanne Y am present with you.
29136	48	4	19	My smale children, whiche Y bere eftsoones, til that Crist be fourmed in you,
29137	48	4	20	and Y wolde now be at you, and chaunge my vois, for Y am confoundid among you.
29138	48	4	21	Seie to me, ye that wolen be vndir the lawe, `han ye not red the lawe?
29139	48	4	22	For it is writun, that Abraham hadde two sones, oon of a seruaunt, and oon of a fre womman.
29140	48	4	23	But he that was of the seruaunt, was borun after the flesh; but he that was of the fre womman, by a biheeste.
29141	48	4	24	The whiche thingis ben seid bi an othir vndirstonding. For these ben two testamentis; oon in the hille of Synai, gendringe in to seruage, which is Agar.
29142	48	4	25	For Syna is an hille that is in Arabie, which hille is ioyned to it that is now Jerusalem, and seruith with hir children.
29143	48	4	26	But that Jerusalem that is aboue, is fre, whiche is oure modir.
29144	48	4	27	For it is writun, Be glad, thou bareyn, that berist not; breke out and crye, that bringist forth no children; for many sones ben of hir that is left of hir hosebonde, more than of hir that hath an hosebonde.
29145	48	4	28	For, britheren, we ben sones of biheeste aftir Isaac;
29146	48	4	29	but now as this that was borun after the fleisch pursuede him that was aftir the spirit, so now.
29147	48	4	30	But what seith the scripture? Caste out the seruaunt and hir sone, for the sone of the seruaunt schal not be eir with the sone of the fre wijf.
29148	48	4	31	And so, britheren, we ben not sones of the seruaunt, but of the fre wijf, bi which fredom Crist hath maad vs fre.
29149	48	5	1	Stonde ye therfor, and nyl ye eftsoones be holdun in the yok of seruage.
29150	48	5	2	Lo! Y Poul seie to you, that if ye ben circumcidid, Crist schal no thing profite to you.
29151	48	5	3	And Y witnesse eftsoones to ech man that circumcidith hym silf, that he is dettour of al the lawe to be don.
29152	48	5	4	And ye ben voidid awei fro Crist, and ye that be iustified in the lawe, ye han fallen awei fro grace.
29153	48	5	5	For we thoruy the spirit of bileue abiden the hope of riytfulnesse.
29154	48	5	6	For in Jhesu Crist nether circumcisioun is ony thing worth, nether prepucie, but the bileue that worchith bi charite.
29155	48	5	7	Ye runnen wel; who lettide you that ye obeyede not to treuthe?
29156	48	5	8	Consente ye to no man; for this counsel ys not of hym that hath clepid you.
29157	48	5	9	A litil souredowy apeirith al the gobet.
29158	48	5	10	I trust on you in oure Lord, that ye schulden vndurstonde noon other thing. And who that disturblith you, schal bere dom, who euere he be.
29159	48	5	11	And, britheren, if Y preche yit circumcisioun, what suffre Y yit persecucioun? thanne the sclaundre of the crosse is auoidid.
29160	48	5	12	Y wolde that thei weren cut awei, that disturblen you.
29161	48	5	13	For, britheren, ye ben clepid in to fredom; oneli yyue ye not fredom in to occasioun of fleisch, but bi charite of spirit serue ye togidere.
29162	48	5	14	For euery lawe is fulfillid in o word, Thou schalt loue thi neiybore as thi silf.
29163	48	5	15	And if ye bite, and ete ech othere, se ye, lest ye be wastid ech fro othere.
29164	48	5	16	And Y seie you in Crist, walke ye in spirit, and ye schulen not performe the desiris of the fleisch.
29165	48	5	17	For the fleisch coueitith ayens the spirit, and the spirit ayen the fleisch; for these ben aduersaries togidere, that ye don not alle thingis that ye wolen.
29166	48	5	18	That if ye be led bi spirit, ye ben not vnder the lawe.
29167	48	5	19	And werkis of the fleisch ben opyn, whiche ben fornicacioun, vnclennes, vnchastite, letcherie, seruice of false goddis,
29168	48	5	20	witchecraftis, enmytees, striuyngis, indignaciouns, wraththis, chidingis, discenciouns, sectis, enuyes,
29169	48	5	21	manslauytris, dronkennessis, vnmesurable etyngis, and thingis lijk to these, whiche Y seie to you, as Y haue told to you `to fore, for thei that doon suche thingis, schulen not haue the kyngdom of God.
29170	48	5	22	But the fruyt of the spirit is charite, ioye, pees, pacience, long abidyng,
29171	48	5	23	benygnyte, goodnesse, myldenesse, feith, temperaunce, contynence, chastite; ayen suche thingis is no lawe.
29172	48	5	24	And they that ben of Crist, han crucified her fleisch with vices and coueytyngis.
29173	48	5	25	If we lyuen bi spirit, walke we bi spirit; be we not made coueytouse of veyn glorie, stirynge ech othere to wraththe, or hauynge enuye ech to othere.
29174	48	6	1	Britheren, if a man be occupied in ony gilt, ye that ben spiritual, enforme ye such oon in spirit of softnesse, biholdinge thi silf, lest that thou be temptid.
29175	48	6	2	Ech bere othere chargis, and so ye schulen fulfille the lawe of Crist.
29176	48	6	3	For who that trowith that he be ouyt, whanne he is nouyt, he bigilith him silf.
29177	48	6	4	But ech man preue his owne werk, and so he schal haue glorie in him silf, and not in an othere.
29178	48	6	5	For ech man schal bere his owne charge.
29179	48	6	6	He that is tauyt bi word, comune he with him that techith hym, in `alle goodis.
29180	48	6	7	Nyle ye erre, God is not scorned;
29181	48	6	8	for tho thingis that a man sowith, tho thingis he schal repe. For he that sowith in his fleisch, of the fleisch he schal repe corrupcioun; but he that sowith in the spirit, of the spirit he schal repe euerelastynge lijf.
29182	48	6	9	And doynge good faile we not; for in his tyme we schal repe, not failinge.
29183	48	6	10	Therfor while we han tyme, worche we good to alle men; but most to hem that ben homliche of the feith.
29184	48	6	11	Se ye, what maner lettris Y haue write to you with myn owne hoond.
29185	48	6	12	For who euere wole plese in the fleisch, `this constreyneth you to be circumcidid, oonli that thei suffren not the persecucioun of Cristis crosse.
29186	48	6	13	For nether thei that ben circumcidid kepen the lawe; but thei wolen that ye be circumcidid, that thei haue glorie in youre fleisch.
29187	48	6	14	But fer be it fro me to haue glorie, no but in the crosse of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, bi whom the world is crucified to me, and Y to the world.
29188	48	6	15	For in Jhesu Crist nether circumcisioun is ony thing worth, ne prepucie, but a newe creature.
29189	48	6	16	And who euere suwen this reule, pees on hem, and merci, and on Israel of God.
29190	48	6	17	And heraftir no man be heuy to me; for Y bere in my bodi the tokenes of oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
29191	48	6	18	The grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist be with youre spirit, britheren. Amen.
29192	49	1	1	Poul, the apostle of Jhesu Crist, bi the wille of God, to alle seyntis that ben at Effesie, and to the feithful men in Jhesu Crist,
29193	49	1	2	grace be to you and pees of God, oure fader, and oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
29194	49	1	3	Blessid be God and the fadir of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, that hath blessid vs in al spiritual blessing in heuenli thingis in Crist,
29195	49	1	4	as he hath chosun vs in hym silf bifor the makyng of the world, that we weren hooli, and with out wem in his siyt, in charite.
29196	49	1	5	Which hath bifor ordeyned vs in to adopcioun of sones bi Jhesu Crist in to hym, bi the purpos of his wille,
29197	49	1	6	in to the heriyng of the glorie of his grace;
29198	49	1	7	in which he hath glorified vs in his dereworthe sone. In whom we han redempcioun bi his blood, foryyuenesse of synnes, aftir the ritchessis of his grace,
29199	49	1	8	that aboundide greetli in vs in al wisdom and prudence,
29200	49	1	9	to make knowun to vs the sacrament of his wille, bi the good plesaunce of hym; the which sacrament he purposide in
29201	49	1	10	hym in the dispensacioun of plente of tymes to enstore alle thingis in Crist, whiche ben in heuenes, and whiche ben in erthe, in hym.
29202	49	1	11	In whom we ben clepid bi sort, bifor ordeyned bi the purpos of hym that worchith alle thingis bi the counsel of his wille;
29203	49	1	12	that we be in to the heriyng of his glorie, we that han hopid bifor in Crist.
29204	49	1	13	In whom also ye weren clepid, whanne ye herden the word of treuthe, the gospel of youre heelthe, in whom ye bileuynge ben merkid with the Hooli Goost of biheest, which is the ernes of oure eritage,
29205	49	1	14	in to the redempcioun of purchasyng, in to heriyng of his glorie.
29206	49	1	15	Therfor and Y herynge youre feith, that is in Crist Jhesu, and the loue in to alle seyntis,
29207	49	1	16	ceesse not to do thankyngis for you, makynge mynde of you in my preieris;
29208	49	1	17	that God of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, the fadir of glorie, yyue to you the spirit of wisdom and of reuelacioun, in to the knowyng of hym;
29209	49	1	18	and the iyen of youre herte liytned, that ye wite, which is the hope of his clepyng, and whiche ben the richessis of the glorie of his eritage in seyntis;
29210	49	1	19	and whych is the excellent greetnesse of his vertu in to vs that han bileuyd, bi the worchyng of the myyt of his vertu,
29211	49	1	20	which he wrouyte in Crist, reisynge hym fro deth, and settynge him on his riyt half in heuenli thingis,
29212	49	1	21	aboue ech principat, and potestat, and vertu, and domynacioun, and aboue ech name that is named, not oneli in this world, but also in the world to comynge;
29213	49	1	22	and made alle thingis suget vndur hise feet, and yaf hym to be heed ouer al the chirche,
29214	49	1	23	that is the bodi of hym, and the plente of hym, which is alle thingis in alle thingis fulfillid.
29215	49	2	1	And whanne ye weren deed in youre giltis and synnes,
29216	49	2	2	in which ye wandriden sum tyme aftir the cours of this world, aftir the prince of the power of this eir, of the spirit that worchith now in to the sones of vnbileue;
29217	49	2	3	in which also we `alle lyueden sum tyme in the desiris of oure fleisch, doynge the willis of the fleisch and of thouytis, and we weren bi kynde the sones of wraththe, as othere men;
29218	49	2	4	but God, that is riche in merci, for his ful myche charite in which he louyde vs,
29219	49	2	5	yhe, whanne we weren deed in synnes, quikenede vs togidere in Crist, bi whos grace ye ben sauyd, and ayen reiside togidere,
29220	49	2	6	and made togidere to sitte in heuenli thingis in Crist Jhesu;
29221	49	2	7	that he schulde schewe in the worldis aboue comynge the plenteuouse ritchessis of his grace in goodnesse on vs in Crist Jhesu.
29222	49	2	8	For bi grace ye ben sauyd bi feith, and this not of you; for it is the yifte of God,
29223	49	2	9	not of werkis, that no man haue glorie.
29224	49	2	10	For we ben the makyng of hym, maad of nouyt in Crist Jhesu, in good werkis, whiche God hath ordeyned, that we go in tho werkis.
29225	49	2	11	For which thing be ye myndeful, that sumtyme ye weren hethene in fleisch, which weren seid prepucie, fro that that is seid circumcisioun maad bi hond in fleisch;
29226	49	2	12	and ye weren in that time with out Crist, alienyd fro the lyuyng of Israel, and gestis of testamentis, not hauynge hope of biheest, and with outen God in this world.
29227	49	2	13	But now in Crist Jhesu ye that weren sum tyme fer, ben maad nyy in the blood of Crist.
29228	49	2	14	For he is oure pees, that made bothe oon, and vnbyndynge the myddil wal of a wal with out morter, enmytees in his fleisch;
29229	49	2	15	and auoidide the lawe of maundementis bi domes, that he make twei in hym silf in to a newe man,
29230	49	2	16	makynge pees, to recounsele bothe in o bodi to God bi the cros, sleynge the enemytees in hym silf.
29231	49	2	17	And he comynge prechide pees to you that weren fer, and pees to hem that weren niy;
29232	49	2	18	for bi hym we bothe han niy comyng in o spirit to the fadir.
29233	49	2	19	Therfor now ye ben not gestis and straungeris, but ye ben citeseyns of seyntis, and houshold meine of God;
29234	49	2	20	aboue bildid on the foundement of apostlis and of profetis, vpon that hiyeste corner stoon, Crist Jhesu;
29235	49	2	21	in whom ech bildyng maad waxith in to an hooli temple in the Lord.
29236	49	2	22	In whom also `be ye bildid togidere in to the habitacle of God, in the Hooli Goost.
29237	49	3	1	For the grace of this thing I Poul, the boundun of Crist Jhesu, for you hethene men,
29238	49	3	2	if netheles ye han herd the dispensacioun of Goddis grace, that is youun to me in you.
29239	49	3	3	For bi reuelacioun the sacrament is maad knowun to me, as Y aboue wroot in schort thing,
29240	49	3	4	as ye moun rede, and vndurstonde my prudence in the mysterie of Crist.
29241	49	3	5	Which was not knowun to othere generaciouns to the sones of men, as it is now schewid to his hooli apostlis and prophetis in the spirit,
29242	49	3	6	that hethene men ben euen eiris, and of oo bodi, and parteneris togidere of his biheest in Crist Jhesu bi the euangelie;
29243	49	3	7	whos mynystre Y am maad, bi the yifte of Goddis grace, which is youun to me bi the worchyng of his vertu.
29244	49	3	8	To me, leeste of alle seyntis, this grace is youun to preche among hethene men the vnserchable richessis of Crist, and to liytne alle men,
29245	49	3	9	which is the dispensacioun of sacrament hid fro worldis in God, that made alle thingis of nouyt;
29246	49	3	10	that the myche fold wisdom of God be knowun to princis and potestatis in heuenli thingis bi the chirche,
29247	49	3	11	bi the bifore ordinaunce of worldis, which he made in Crist Jhesu oure Lord.
29248	49	3	12	In whom we han trist and nyy comyng, in tristenyng bi the feith of hym.
29249	49	3	13	For which thing Y axe, that ye faile not in my tribulaciouns for you, which is youre glorie.
29250	49	3	14	For grace of this thing Y bowe my knees to the fadir of oure Lord Jhesu Crist,
29251	49	3	15	of whom ech fadirhod in heuenes and in erthe is named,
29252	49	3	16	that he yyue to you, aftir the richessis of his glorie, vertu to be strengthid bi his spirit in the ynnere man,
29253	49	3	17	that Crist dwelle bi feith in youre hertis; that ye rootid and groundid in charite,
29254	49	3	18	moun comprehende with alle seyntis, which is the breede, and the lengthe, and the hiynesse, and the depnesse;
29255	49	3	19	also to wite the charite of Crist more excellent than science, that ye be fillid in al the plentee of God.
29256	49	3	20	And to hym that is myyti to do alle thingis more plenteuousli than we axen or vndurstondun, bi the vertu that worchith in vs,
29257	49	3	21	to hym be glorie in the chirche, and in Crist Jhesu, in to alle the generaciouns of the world of worldis. Amen.
29258	49	4	1	Therfor Y boundun for the Lord biseche you, that ye walke worthili in the clepyng,
29259	49	4	2	in which ye ben clepid, with al mekenesse and myldenesse, with pacience supportinge ech other in charite,
29260	49	4	3	bisi to kepe vnyte of spirit in the boond of pees.
29261	49	4	4	O bodi and o spirit, as ye ben clepid in oon hope of youre cleping;
29262	49	4	5	o Lord,
29263	49	4	6	o feith, o baptym, o God and fadir of alle, which is aboue alle men, and bi alle thingis, and in vs alle.
29264	49	4	7	But to ech of vs grace is youun bi the mesure of the yyuyng of Crist;
29265	49	4	8	for which thing he seith, He stiynge an hiy, ledde caitifte caitif, he yaf yiftis to men.
29266	49	4	9	But what is it, that he stiede vp, no but that also he cam doun first in to the lowere partis of the erthe?
29267	49	4	10	He it is that cam doun, and that stiede on alle heuenes, that he schulde fille alle thingis.
29268	49	4	11	And he yaf summe apostlis, summe prophetis, othere euangelistis, othere scheepherdis and techeris,
29269	49	4	12	to the ful endyng of seyntis, in to the werk of mynystrie, in to edificacioun of Cristis bodi,
29270	49	4	13	til we rennen alle, in to vnyte of feith and of knowyng of Goddis sone, in to a parfit man, aftir the mesure of age of the plente of Crist;
29271	49	4	14	that we be not now litle children, mouynge as wawis, and be not borun aboute with ech wynd of teching, in the weiwardnesse of men, in sutil wit, to the disseyuyng of errour.
29272	49	4	15	But do we treuthe in charite, and wexe in him by alle thingis, that is Crist oure heed;
29273	49	4	16	of whom alle the bodi set togidere, and boundun togidere bi ech ioynture of vnder seruyng, bi worching in to the mesure of ech membre, makith encreesyng of the bodi, in to edificacioun of it silf in charite.
29274	49	4	17	Therfor Y seie and witnesse this thing in the Lord, that ye walke not now, as hethene men walken, in the vanyte of her wit;
29275	49	4	18	that han vndurstondyng derkned with derknessis, and ben alienyd fro the lijf of God, bi ignoraunce that is in hem, for the blyndenesse of her herte.
29276	49	4	19	Which dispeirynge bitoken hem silf to vnchastite, in to the worchyng of al vnclennesse in coueitise.
29277	49	4	20	But ye han not so lerud Crist, if netheles ye herden hym,
29278	49	4	21	and ben tauyt in hym, as is treuthe in Jhesu.
29279	49	4	22	Do ye awey bi the elde lyuyng the elde man, that is corrupt bi the desiris of errour;
29280	49	4	23	and be ye renewlid in the spirit of youre soule;
29281	49	4	24	and clothe ye the newe man, which is maad aftir God in riytwisnesse and hoolynesse of treuthe.
29282	49	4	25	For which thing `ye putte awei leesyng, and speke ye treuthe ech man with his neiybore, for we ben membris ech to othere.
29283	49	4	26	Be ye wrooth, and nyle ye do synne; the sunne falle not doun on youre wraththe.
29284	49	4	27	Nyle ye yyue stide to the deuel.
29285	49	4	28	He that stal, now stele he not; but more trauele he in worchinge with hise hondis that that is good, that he haue whereof he schal yyue to nedi.
29286	49	4	29	Ech yuel word go not of youre mouth; but if ony is good to the edificacioun of feith, that it yyue grace to men that heren.
29287	49	4	30	And nyle ye make the Hooli Goost of God sori, in which ye ben markid in the dai of redempcioun.
29288	49	4	31	Al bitternesse, and wraththe, and indignacioun, and cry, and blasfemye be takun awey fro you, with al malice;
29289	49	4	32	and be ye togidere benygne, merciful, foryyuynge togidere, as also God foryaf to you in Crist.
29290	49	5	1	Therfor be ye foloweris of God, as moost dereworthe sones;
29291	49	5	2	and walke ye in loue, as Crist louyde vs, and yaf hym silf for vs an offryng and a sacrifice to God, in to the odour of swetnesse.
29292	49	5	3	And fornycacioun, and al vnclennesse, or aueryce, be not named among you, as it bicometh holi men;
29293	49	5	4	ethir filthe, or foli speche, or harlatrye, that perteyneth not to profit, but more doyng of thankyngis.
29294	49	5	5	For wite ye this, and vndurstonde, that ech letchour, or vnclene man, or coueytouse, that serueth to mawmetis, hath not eritage in the kingdom of Crist and of God.
29295	49	5	6	No man disseyue you bi veyn wordis; for whi for these thingis the wraththe of God cam on the sones of vnbileue.
29296	49	5	7	Therfor nyle ye be maad parteneris of hem.
29297	49	5	8	For ye weren sum tyme derknessis, but now `ye ben liyt in the Lord. Walke ye as the sones of liyt.
29298	49	5	9	For the fruyt of liyt is in al goodnesse, and riytwisnesse, and treuthe.
29299	49	5	10	And preue ye what `thing is wel plesynge to God.
29300	49	5	11	And nyle ye comyne to vnfruytouse werkis of derknessis; but more repreue ye.
29301	49	5	12	For what thingis ben don of hem in priuy, it is foule, yhe, to speke.
29302	49	5	13	And alle thingis that ben repreuyd of the liyt, ben opynli schewid; for al thing that is schewid, is liyt.
29303	49	5	14	For which thing he seith, Rise thou that slepist, and rise vp fro deth, and Crist schal liytne thee.
29304	49	5	15	Therfor, britheren, se ye, hou warli ye schulen go;
29305	49	5	16	not as vnwise men, but as wise men, ayenbiynge tyme, for the daies ben yuele.
29306	49	5	17	Therfor nyle ye be maad vnwise, but vndurstondynge which is the wille of God.
29307	49	5	18	And nyle ye be drunkun of wyn, in which is letcherie, but be ye fillid with the Hooli Goost; and speke ye to you silf in salmes,
29308	49	5	19	and ymnes, and spiritual songis, syngynge and seiynge salm in youre hertis to the Lord;
29309	49	5	20	euermore doynge thankingis for alle thingis in the name of oure Lord Jhesu Crist to God and to the fadir.
29310	49	5	21	Be ye suget togidere in the drede of Crist.
29311	49	5	22	Wymmen, be thei suget to her hosebondis,
29312	49	5	23	as to the Lord, for the man is heed of the wymman, as Crist is heed of the chirche; he is sauyour of his bodi.
29313	49	5	24	But as the chirche is suget to Crist, so wymmen to her hosebondis in alle thingis.
29314	49	5	25	Men, loue ye youre wyues, as Crist louyde the chirche, and yaf hym silf for it, to make it holi;
29315	49	5	26	and clenside it with the waisching of watir, in the word of lijf,
29316	49	5	27	to yyue the chirche gloriouse to hym silf, that it hadde no wem, ne ryueling, or ony siche thing, but that it be hooli and vndefoulid.
29317	49	5	28	So and men `schulen loue her wyues, as her owne bodies. He that loueth his wijf, loueth hym silf;
29318	49	5	29	for no man hatide euere his owne fleisch, but nurischith and fostrith it, as Crist doith the chirche.
29319	49	5	30	And we ben membris of his bodi, of his fleisch, and of his boonys.
29320	49	5	31	For this thing a man schal forsake his fadir and modir, and he schal drawe to his wijf; and thei schulen be tweyne in o fleisch.
29321	49	5	32	This sacrament is greet; yhe, Y seie in Crist, and in the chirche.
29322	49	5	33	Netheles ye alle, ech man loue his wijf as hym silf; and the wijf drede hir hosebonde.
29323	49	6	1	Sones, obeische ye to youre fadir and modir, in the Lord; for this thing is riytful.
29324	49	6	2	Onoure thou thi fadir and thi modir, that is the firste maundement in biheest;
29325	49	6	3	that it be wel to thee, and that thou be long lyuynge on the erthe.
29326	49	6	4	And, fadris, nyle ye terre youre sones to wraththe; but nurische ye hem in the teching and chastising of the Lord.
29327	49	6	5	Seruauntis, obeische ye to fleischli lordis with drede and trembling, in simplenesse of youre herte, as to Crist;
29328	49	6	6	not seruynge at the iye, as plesinge to men, but as seruauntis of Crist; doynge the wille of God bi discrecioun,
29329	49	6	7	with good wille seruynge as to the Lord, and not as to men;
29330	49	6	8	witinge that ech man, what euere good thing he schal do, he schal resseyue this of the Lord, whether seruaunt, whether fre man.
29331	49	6	9	And, ye lordis, do the same thingis to hem, foryyuynge manaasis; witinge that bothe her Lord and youre is in heuenes, and the taking of persones is not anentis God.
29332	49	6	10	Her aftirward, britheren, be ye coumfortid in the Lord, and in the miyt of his vertu.
29333	49	6	11	Clothe you with the armere of God, that ye moun stonde ayens aspiynges of the deuel.
29334	49	6	12	For whi stryuyng is not to vs ayens fleisch and blood, but ayens princis and potestatis, ayens gouernours of the world of these derknessis, ayens spiritual thingis of wickidnesse, in heuenli thingis.
29335	49	6	13	Therfor take ye the armere of God, that ye moun ayenstonde in the yuel dai; and in alle thingis stonde perfit.
29336	49	6	14	Therfor stonde ye, and be gird aboute youre leendis in sothefastnesse, and clothid with the haburioun of riytwisnesse,
29337	49	6	15	and youre feet schood in making redi of the gospel of pees.
29338	49	6	16	In alle thingis take ye the scheld of feith, in which ye moun quenche alle the firy dartis of `the worste.
29339	49	6	17	And take ye the helm of helthe, and the swerd of the Goost, that is, the word of God.
29340	49	6	18	Bi al preier and bisechyng preie ye al tyme in spirit, and in hym wakinge in al bisynesse, and bisechyng for alle hooli men, and for me;
29341	49	6	19	that word be youun to me in openyng of my mouth, with trist to make knowun the mysterie of the gospel,
29342	49	6	20	for which Y am set in message in a chayne; so that in it Y be hardi to speke, as it bihoueth me.
29343	49	6	21	And ye wite, what thingis ben aboute me, what Y do, Titicus, my moost dere brother, and trewe mynystre in the Lord, schal make alle thingis knowun to you;
29344	49	6	22	whom Y sente to you for this same thing, that ye knowe what thingis ben aboute vs, and that he coumforte youre hertis.
29345	49	6	23	Pees to britheren, and charite, with feith of God oure fadir, and of the Lord Jhesu Crist.
29346	49	6	24	Grace with alle men that louen oure Lord Jhesu Crist in vncorrupcioun. Amen, `that is, So be it.
29347	50	1	1	Poul and Tymothe, seruauntis of Jhesu Crist, to alle the hooli men in Crist Jhesu, that ben at Filippis, with bischopis and dekenes,
29348	50	1	2	grace and pees to you of God oure fadir, and of the Lord Jhesu Crist.
29349	50	1	3	I do thankyngis to my God
29350	50	1	4	in al mynde of you euere more in alle my preyeris for alle you with ioye, and
29351	50	1	5	make a bisechyng on youre comynyng in the gospel of Crist, fro the firste day til nowe;
29352	50	1	6	tristenynge this ilke thing, that he that bigan in you a good werk, schal perfourme it til in to the dai of Jhesu Crist.
29353	50	1	7	As it is iust to me to feele this thing for alle you, for that Y haue you in herte, and in my boondis, and in defending and confermyng of the gospel, that alle ye be felowis of my ioye.
29354	50	1	8	For God is a witnesse to me, hou Y coueyte alle you in the bowelis of Jhesu Crist.
29355	50	1	9	And this thing Y preie, that youre charite be plenteuouse more and more in kunnyng, and in al wit;
29356	50	1	10	that ye preue the betere thingis, that ye be clene and without offence in the dai of Crist;
29357	50	1	11	fillid with the fruyt of riytwysnesse bi Jhesu Crist, in to the glory and the heriyng of God.
29358	50	1	12	For, britheren, Y wole that ye wite, that the thingis that ben aboute me han comun more to the profit of the gospel,
29359	50	1	13	so that my boondis weren maad knowun in Crist, in ech moot halle, and in alle other placis;
29360	50	1	14	that mo of britheren tristinge in the Lord more plenteuously for my boondis, dursten without drede speke the word of God.
29361	50	1	15	But summe for enuye and strijf, summe for good wille, prechen Crist;
29362	50	1	16	and summe of charite, witinge that Y am put in the defense of the gospel.
29363	50	1	17	But summe of strijf schewen Crist not cleneli, gessynge hem to reise tribulacioun to my boondis.
29364	50	1	18	But what? the while on al maner, ethir bi occasioun, ethir bi treuthe, Crist is schewid; and in this thing Y haue ioye, but also Y schal haue ioye.
29365	50	1	19	And Y woot, that this thing schal come to me in to heelthe bi youre preyer, and the vndurmynystring of the spirit of `Jhesu Crist, bi myn abidyng and hope.
29366	50	1	20	For in no thing Y schal be schamed, but in al trist as euere more and now, Crist schal be magnefied in my bodi, ether bi lijf, ether bi deth.
29367	50	1	21	For me to lyue is Crist, and to die is wynnyng.
29368	50	1	22	That if to lyue in fleisch, is fruyt of werk to me, lo! what Y schal chese, Y knowe not.
29369	50	1	23	But Y am constreyned of twei thingis, Y haue desire to be dissolued, and to be with Crist, it is myche more betere; but to dwelle in fleisch,
29370	50	1	24	is nedeful for you.
29371	50	1	25	And Y tristinge this thing, woot that Y schal dwelle, and perfitli dwelle to alle you, to youre profit and ioye of feith,
29372	50	1	26	that youre thanking abounde in Crist Jhesu in me, bi my comyng eftsoone to you.
29373	50	1	27	Oneli lyue ye worthili to the gospel of Crist, that whether whanne Y come and se you, ethir absent Y here of you, that ye stonden in o spirit of o wille, trauelinge togidere to the feith of the gospel.
29374	50	1	28	And in no thing be ye aferd of aduersaries, which is to hem cause of perdicioun,
29375	50	1	29	but to you cause of heelthe. And this thing is of God. For it is youun to you for Crist, that not oneli ye bileuen in hym, but also that ye suffren for hym;
29376	50	1	30	hauynge the same strijf, which ye saien in me, and now ye han herd of me.
29377	50	2	1	Therfor if ony coumfort is in Crist, if ony solace of charite, if ony felouschipe of spirit, if ony inwardnesse of merci doyng,
29378	50	2	2	fille ye my ioye, that ye vndurstonde the same thing, and haue the same charite, of o wille, and feelen the same thing;
29379	50	2	3	no thing bi strijf, nether by veyn glorie, but in mekenesse, demynge eche othere to be heiyer than hym silf;
29380	50	2	4	not biholdinge ech bi hym silf what thingis ben his owne, but tho thingis that ben of othere men.
29381	50	2	5	And fele ye this thing in you, which also in Crist Jhesu;
29382	50	2	6	that whanne he was in the forme of God, demyde not raueyn, that hym silf were euene to God;
29383	50	2	7	but he lowide hym silf, takinge the forme of a seruaunt, and was maad in to the licknesse of men, and in abite was foundun as a man.
29384	50	2	8	He mekide hym silf, and was maad obedient to the deth, yhe, to the deth of the cross.
29385	50	2	9	For which thing God enhaunside hym, and yaf to hym a name that is aboue al name;
29386	50	2	10	that in the name of Jhesu ech kne be bowid, of heuenli thingis, of ertheli thingis, and of hellis;
29387	50	2	11	and ech tunge knouleche, that the Lord Jhesu Crist is in the glorie of God the fadir.
29388	50	2	12	Therfor, my most dereworthe britheren, as euere more ye han obeischid, not in my presence onely, but myche more now in myn absence, worche ye with drede and trembling youre heelthe.
29389	50	2	13	For it is God that worchith in you, bothe to wilne, and to performe, for good wille.
29390	50	2	14	And do ye alle thingis with out grutchingis and doutyngis;
29391	50	2	15	that ye be with out playnt, and symple as the sones of God, with out repreef, in the myddil of a schrewid nacioun and a weiward; among whiche ye schynen as yyueris of liyt in the world.
29392	50	2	16	And holde ye togidere the word of lijf to my glorie in the day of Crist; for Y haue not runnen in veyn, nether Y haue trauelid in veyn.
29393	50	2	17	But thouy Y be offrid or slayn on the sacrifice and seruyce of youre feith, Y haue ioye, and Y thanke you alle.
29394	50	2	18	And the same thing haue ye ioye, and thanke ye me.
29395	50	2	19	And Y hope in the Lord Jhesu, that Y schal sende Tymothe soone to you, that Y be of good coumfort, whanne tho thingis ben knowun that ben aboute you.
29396	50	2	20	For Y haue no man so of o wille, that is bisi for you with clene affeccioun.
29397	50	2	21	For alle men seken tho thingis that ben her owne, not tho that ben of Crist Jhesu.
29398	50	2	22	But knowe ye the asaie of hym, for as a sone to the fadir he hath seruyd with me in the gospel.
29399	50	2	23	Therfor Y hope that Y schal sende hym to you, anoon as Y se what thingis ben aboute me.
29400	50	2	24	And Y triste in the Lord, that also my silf schal come to you soone.
29401	50	2	25	And Y gesside it nedeful to sende to you Epafrodite, my brother and euene worchere, and myn euene knyyt, but youre apostle, and the mynystre of my nede.
29402	50	2	26	For he desiride you alle, and he was sorewful, therfor that ye herden that he was sijk.
29403	50	2	27	For he was sijk to the deth, but God hadde merci on him; and not oneli on hym, but also on me, lest Y hadde heuynesse on heuynesse.
29404	50	2	28	Therfor more hastili Y sente hym, that whanne ye han seyn hym, ye haue ioye eft, and Y be withouten heuynesse.
29405	50	2	29	Therfor resseyue ye hym with al ioye in the Lord, and haue ye suche with al onour.
29406	50	2	30	For the werk of Crist he wente to deth, yyuynge his lijf, that he schulde fulfille that that failide of you anentis my seruyce.
29407	50	3	1	Hennus forward, my britheren, haue ye ioye in the Lord. To write to you the same thingis, to me it is not slow, and to you it is necessarie.
29408	50	3	2	Se ye houndis, se ye yuele werk men, se ye dyuysioun.
29409	50	3	3	For we ben circumcisioun, which bi spirit seruen to God, and glorien in Crist Jhesu, and han not trist in the fleisch,
29410	50	3	4	thouy Y haue trust, yhe, in the fleisch. If ony othere man is seyn to triste in the fleisch,
29411	50	3	5	Y more, that was circumcidid in the eiytthe dai, of the kyn of Israel, of the lynage of Beniamyn, an Ebrew of Ebrewis, bi the lawe a Farisee,
29412	50	3	6	bi loue pursuynge the chirche of God, bi riytwisnesse that is in the lawe lyuynge with out playnt.
29413	50	3	7	But whiche thingis weren to me wynnyngis, Y haue demed these apeyryngis for Crist.
29414	50	3	8	Netheles Y gesse alle thingis to be peirement for the cleer science of Jhesu Crist my Lord. For whom Y made alle thingis peyrement, and Y deme as drit,
29415	50	3	9	that Y wynne Crist, and that Y be foundun in hym, not hauynge my riytwisnesse that is of the lawe, but that that is of the feith of Crist Jhesu, that is of God the riytwisnesse in feith,
29416	50	3	10	to knowe hym, and the vertu of his risyng ayen, and the felouschipe of his passioun, and be maad lijk to his deeth,
29417	50	3	11	if on ony maner Y come to the resurreccioun that is fro deth.
29418	50	3	12	Not that now Y haue takun, or now am parfit; but Y sue, if in ony maner Y comprehende, in which thing also Y am comprehendid of Crist Jhesu.
29419	50	3	13	Bretheren, Y deme me not that Y haue comprehendid; but o thing, Y foryete tho thingis that ben bihyndis, and stretche forth my silf to tho thingis that ben bifore,
29420	50	3	14	and pursue to the ordeyned mede of the hiy clepyng of God in Crist Jhesu.
29421	50	3	15	Therfor who euere we ben perfit, feele we this thing. And if ye vndurstonden in othere manere ony thing, this thing God schal schewe to you.
29422	50	3	16	Netheles to what thing we han comun, that we vndurstonden the same thing, and that we perfitli dwelle in the same reule.
29423	50	3	17	Britheren, be ye my foleweris, and weyte ye hem that walken so, as ye han oure fourme.
29424	50	3	18	For many walken, whiche Y haue seid ofte to you, but now Y wepinge seie, the enemyes of Cristis cros,
29425	50	3	19	who ende is deth, whos god is the wombe, and the glorie in confusioun of hem, that saueren ertheli thingis.
29426	50	3	20	But oure lyuyng is in heuenes; fro whennus also we abiden the sauyour oure Lord Jhesu Crist,
29427	50	3	21	which schal reforme the bodi of oure mekenesse, that is maad lijk to the bodi of his clerenesse, bi the worching bi which he mai `also make alle thingis suget to hym.
29428	50	4	1	Therfor, my britheren most dereworthe and most desirid, my ioye and my coroun, so stonde ye in the Lord, most dere britheren.
29429	50	4	2	Y preye Eucodiam, and biseche Synticem, to vndurstonde the same thing in the Lord.
29430	50	4	3	Also Y preye and thee, german felow, helpe thou the ilke wymmen that traueliden with me in the gospel, with Clement and othere myn helperis, whos names ben in the book of lijf.
29431	50	4	4	Ioye ye in the Lord euere more; eft Y seie, ioye ye.
29432	50	4	5	Be youre pacyence knowun to alle men; the Lord is niy.
29433	50	4	6	Be ye nothing bisi, but in al preyer and biseching, with doyng of thankyngis, be youre axyngis knowun at God.
29434	50	4	7	And the pees of God, that passith al wit, kepe youre hertis and vndurstondingis in Crist Jhesu.
29435	50	4	8	Fro hennus forth, britheren, what euere thingis ben sothe, what euere thingis chast, what euere thingis iust, what euere thingis hooli, what euere thingis able to be louyd, what euere thingis of good fame, if ony vertu, if ony preising of discipline, thenke ye these thingis,
29436	50	4	9	that also ye han lerud, and take, and heed, and seyn in me. Do ye these thingis, and God of pees schal be with you.
29437	50	4	10	But Y ioyede greetli in the Lord, that sum tyme aftirward ye floureden ayen to feele for me, as also ye feeliden. But ye weren ocupied, Y seie not as for nede,
29438	50	4	11	for Y haue lerud to be sufficient in whiche thingis Y am.
29439	50	4	12	And Y can also be lowid, Y can also haue plentee. Euery where and in alle thingis Y am tauyt to be fillid, and to hungur, and to abounde, and to suffre myseiste.
29440	50	4	13	Y may alle thingis in hym that coumfortith me.
29441	50	4	14	Netheles ye han doon wel, comynynge to my tribulacioun.
29442	50	4	15	For and ye, Filipensis, witen, that in the bigynnyng of the gospel, whanne Y wente forth fro Macedonye, no chirche comynede with me in resoun of thing youun and takun, but ye aloone.
29443	50	4	16	Whiche senten to Tessalonyk onys and twies also in to vss to me.
29444	50	4	17	Not for Y seke yifte, but Y requyre fruyt aboundinge in youre resoun.
29445	50	4	18	For Y haue alle thingis, and abounde; Y am fillid with tho thingis takun of Epafrodite, whiche ye senten in to the odour of swetnesse, a couenable sacrifice, plesynge to God.
29446	50	4	19	And my God fil alle youre desire, by hise richessis in glorie in Crist Jhesu.
29447	50	4	20	But to God and oure fadir be glorie in to worldis of worldis.
29448	50	4	21	Amen. Grete ye wel euery hooli man in Crist Jhesu.
29449	50	4	22	Tho britheren that ben with me, greten you wel. Alle hooli men greten you wel, moost sotheli thei that ben of the emperouris hous.
29450	50	4	23	The grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist be with youre spirit. Amen.
29451	51	1	1	Poul, apostle of `Crist Jhesu, bi the wille of God,
29452	51	1	2	and Tymothe, brother, to hem that ben at Colose, hooli and feithful britheren in Crist Jhesu,

29454	51	1	4	and the loue that ye han to alle hooli men,
29455	51	1	5	for the hope that is kept to you in heuenes. Which ye herden in the word of treuthe of the gospel,
29456	51	1	6	that cam to you, as also it is in al the world, and makith fruyt, and wexith, as in you, fro that dai in which ye herden and knewen the grace of God in treuthe.
29457	51	1	7	As ye lerneden of Epafras, oure felawe most dereworthe, which is a trewe mynystre of Jhesu Crist for you;
29458	51	1	8	which also schewide to vs youre louyng in spirit.
29459	51	1	9	Therfor we fro the dai in which we herden, ceessen not to preye for you, and to axe, that ye be fillid with the knowing of his wille in al wisdom and goostli vndurstondyng;
29460	51	1	10	that ye walke worthili to God plesynge bi alle thingis, and make fruyt in al good werk, and wexe in the science of God,
29461	51	1	11	and ben coumfortid in al vertu bi the miyt of his clerenesse, in al pacience and long abiding with ioye,
29462	51	1	12	that ye do thankyngis to God and to the fadir, which made you worthi in to the part of eritage of hooli men in liyt.
29463	51	1	13	Which delyueride vs fro the power of derknessis, and translatide in to the kyngdom of the sone of his louyng,
29464	51	1	14	in whom we han ayenbiyng and remyssioun of synnes.
29465	51	1	15	Which is the ymage of God vnuysible, the first bigetun of ech creature.
29466	51	1	16	For in hym alle thingis ben maad, in heuenes and in erthe, visible and vnuysible, ether trones, ether dominaciouns, ether princehodes, ethir poweris, alle thingis ben maad of nouyt bi hym, and in hym,
29467	51	1	17	and he is bifor alle, and alle thingis ben in hym.
29468	51	1	18	And he is heed of the bodi of the chirche; which is the bigynnyng and the firste bigetun of deede men, that he holde the firste dignyte in alle thingis.
29469	51	1	19	For in hym it pleside al plente to inhabite,
29470	51	1	20	and bi hym alle thingis to be recounselid in to hym, and made pees bi the blood of his cros, tho thingis that ben in erthis, ether that ben in heuenes.
29471	51	1	21	And whanne ye weren sumtyme aliened, and enemyes bi wit in yuele werkis,
29472	51	1	22	now he hath recounselid you in the bodi of his fleisch bi deth, to haue you hooli, and vnwemmyd, and with out repreef bifor hym.
29473	51	1	23	If netheles ye dwellen in the feith, foundid, and stable, and vnmouable fro the hope of the gospel that ye han herd, which is prechid in al creature that is vndur heuene. Of which Y Poul am maad mynystre,
29474	51	1	24	and now Y haue ioye in passioun for you, and Y fille tho thingis that failen of the passiouns of Crist in my fleisch, for his bodi, that is the chirche.
29475	51	1	25	Of which Y Poul am maad mynystre bi the dispensacioun of God, that is youun to me in you,
29476	51	1	26	that Y fille the word of God, the priuyte, that was hid fro worldis and generaciouns. But now it is schewid to his seyntis,
29477	51	1	27	to whiche God wold make knowun the richessis of the glorie of this sacrament in hethene men, which is Crist in you, the hope of glorie.
29478	51	1	28	Whom we schewen, repreuynge ech man, and techinge `ech man in al wisdom, that we offre ech man perfit in Crist Jhesu.
29479	51	1	29	In which thing also Y trauele in stryuynge bi the worching of hym, that he worchith in me in vertu.
29480	51	2	1	But Y wole that ye wite, what bisynesse Y haue for you, and for hem that ben at Laodice, and whiche euere saien not my face in fleisch,
29481	51	2	2	that her hertis ben coumfortid, and thei ben tauyt in charite, in to alle the richessis of the plente of the vndurstondyng, in to the knowyng of mysterie of God, the fadir of Jhesu Crist,
29482	51	2	3	in whom alle the tresouris of wisdom and of science ben hid.
29483	51	2	4	For this thing Y seie, that no man disseyue you in heiythe of wordis.
29484	51	2	5	For thouy Y be absent in bodi, bi spirit Y am with you, ioiynge and seynge youre ordre and the sadnesse of youre bileue that is in Crist.
29485	51	2	6	Therfor as ye han takun Jhesu Crist oure Lord,
29486	51	2	7	walke ye in hym, and be ye rootid and bieldid aboue in hym, and confermyd in the bileue, as ye han lerud, aboundinge in hym in doynge of thankyngis.
29487	51	2	8	Se ye that no man disseyue you bi filosofie and veyn fallace, aftir the tradicioun of men, aftir the elementis of the world, and not aftir Crist.
29488	51	2	9	For in hym dwellith bodilich al the fulnesse of the Godhed.
29489	51	2	10	And ye ben fillid in hym, that is heed of al principat and power.
29490	51	2	11	In whom also ye ben circumcidid in circumcisioun not maad with hoond, in dispoyling of the bodi of fleisch, but in circumcisioun of Crist;
29491	51	2	12	and ye ben biried togidere with hym in baptim, in whom also ye han rise ayen bi feith of the worching of God, that reiside hym fro deth.
29492	51	2	13	And whanne ye weren deed in giltis, and in the prepucie of youre fleisch, he quikenyde togidere you with hym;
29493	51	2	14	foryyuynge to you alle giltis, doynge awei that writing of decre that was ayens vs, that was contrarie to vs; and he took awei that fro the myddil, pitchinge it on the cros;
29494	51	2	15	and he spuylide principatis and poweris, and ledde out tristili, opynli ouercomynge hem in hym silf.
29495	51	2	16	Therfor no man iuge you in mete, or in drink, or in part of feeste dai, or of neomenye,
29496	51	2	17	or of sabatis, whiche ben schadewe of thingis to comynge; for the bodi is of Crist.
29497	51	2	18	No man disseyue you, willynge to teche in mekenesse, and religioun of aungelis, tho thingis whiche he hath not seyn, walkinge veynli, bolnyd with wit of his fleisch,
29498	51	2	19	and not holdynge the heed, of which al the bodi, bi boondis and ioynyngis togidere vndur mynystrid and maad, wexith in to encreessing of God.
29499	51	2	20	For if ye ben deed with Crist fro the elementis of this world, what yit as men lyuynge to the world demen ye?
29500	51	2	21	That ye touche not, nether taaste,
29501	51	2	22	nether trete with hoondis tho thingis, whiche alle ben in to deth bi the ilke vss, aftir the comaundementis and the techingis of men;
29502	51	2	23	whiche han a resoun of wisdom in veyn religioun and mekenesse, and not to spare the bodi, not in ony onour to the fulfillyng of the fleisch.
29503	51	3	1	Therfor if ye han risun togidere with Crist, seke ye tho thingis that ben aboue, where Crist is sittynge in the riythalf of God.
29504	51	3	2	Sauere ye tho thingis, that ben aboue, not tho that ben on the erthe.

29549	52	1	4	Ye louyde britheren of God, we witinge youre chesing;
29550	52	1	5	for oure gospel was not at you in word oneli, but also in vertu, and in the Hooli Goost, and in myche plente; as ye witen, whiche we weren among you for you;
29551	52	1	6	and ye ben maad foleweris of vs, and of the Lord, resseyuynge the word in myche tribulacioun, with ioye of the Hooli Goost;
29552	52	1	7	so that ye ben maad ensaumple to alle men that bileuen, in Macedonye and in Acaie.
29553	52	1	8	For of you the word of the Lord is pupplischid, not oneli in Macedonye and Acaie, but youre feith that is to God, in ech place is gon forth; so that it is not nede to vs to speke ony thing.
29554	52	1	9	For thei schewen of you, what maner entre we hadden to you, and hou ye ben conuertid to God fro maumettis, to serue to the lyuynge God and veri; and to abide his sone fro heuenes,
29555	52	1	10	whom he reiside fro deth, the Lord Jhesu, that delyuerede us fro wraththe to comynge.
29556	52	2	1	For, britheren, ye witen oure entre to you, for it was not veyn;
29557	52	2	2	but first we suffriden, and weren punyschid with wrongis, as ye witen in Filippis, and hadden trust in oure Lord, to speke to you the gospel of God in myche bisynesse.
29558	52	2	3	And oure exortacioun is not of errour, nether of vnclennesse, nether in gile,
29559	52	2	4	but as we ben preued of God, that the gospel of God schulde be takun to vs, so we speken; not as plesynge to men, but to God that preueth oure hertis.
29560	52	2	5	For nether we weren ony tyme in word of glosing, as ye witen, nether in occasioun of auerise; God is witnesse; nether sekinge glorie of men,
29561	52	2	6	nether of you,
29562	52	2	7	nether of othere, whanne we, as Cristis apostlis, miyten haue be in charge to you. But we weren maad litle in the myddil of you, as if a nursche fostre hir sones;
29563	52	2	8	so we desiringe you with greet loue, wolden haue bitake to you, not oneli the gospel of God, but also oure lyues, for ye ben maad most dereworthe to vs.
29564	52	2	9	For, britheren, ye ben myndeful of oure trauel and werynesse; we worchiden nyyt and day, that we schulden not greue ony of you, and prechiden to you the euangelie of God.
29565	52	2	10	God and ye ben witnessis, hou holili, and iustli, and with outen pleynt, we weren to you that bileueden.
29566	52	2	11	As ye witen, hou we preyeden you, and coumfortiden ech of you, as the fadir hise sones,
29567	52	2	12	and we han witnessid, that ye schulden go worthili to God, that clepide you in to his kingdom and glorie.
29568	52	2	13	Therfor we doon thankingis to God with outen ceessyng. For whanne ye hadden take of vs the word `of the heryng of God, ye token it not as the word of men, but as `it is verili, the word of God, that worchith in you that han bileued.
29569	52	2	14	For, britheren, ye ben maad foleweris of the chirchis of God, that ben in Jude, in Crist Jhesu, for ye han suffrid the same thingis of youre euene lynagis, as thei of the Jewis.
29570	52	2	15	Whiche slowen bothe the Lord Jhesu and the profetis, and pursueden vs, and thei plesen not to God, and thei ben aduersaries to alle men;
29571	52	2	16	forbedinge vs to speke to hethene men, that thei be maad saaf, that thei fille her synnes euere more; for the wraththe of God cam on hem in to the ende.
29572	52	2	17	And, britheren, we desolat fro you for a tyme, bi mouth and in biholding, but not in herte, han hiyed more plenteuousli to se youre face with greet desir.
29573	52	2	18	For we wolden come to you, yhe, Y Poul, onys and eftsoone, but Sathanas lettide vs.
29574	52	2	19	For whi what is oure hope, or ioye, or coroun of glorie? Whether ye ben not bifore oure Lord Jhesu Crist in his comyng?
29575	52	2	20	For ye ben oure glorie and ioye.
29576	52	3	1	For which thing we suffriden no lengere, and it pleside to vs to dwelle aloone at Atenys;
29577	52	3	2	and we senten Tymothe, oure brother, and mynystre of God in the euangelie of Crist, to you to be confermyd, and to be tauyt for youre feith,
29578	52	3	3	that no man be mouyd in these tribulaciouns. For ye silf witen, that in this this thing we ben set.
29579	52	3	4	For whanne we weren at you, we biforseiden to you, that we schulden suffre tribulaciouns; as it is don, and ye witen.
29580	52	3	5	Therfor Y Poul, no lenger abidinge, sente to knowe youre feith, lest perauenture he that temptith tempte you, and youre trauel be maad veyn.
29581	52	3	6	But now, whanne Tymothe schal come to vs fro you, and telle to vs youre feith and charite, and that ye han good mynde of vs, euere desyringe to se vs, as we also you;
29582	52	3	7	therfor, britheren, we ben coumfortid in you, in al oure nede and tribulacioun, bi youre feith.
29583	52	3	8	For now we lyuen, if ye stonden in the Lord.
29584	52	3	9	For what doyng of thankingis moun we yelde to God for you, in al ioye, in which we ioyen for you bifor oure Lord?
29585	52	3	10	nyyt and dai more plenteuousli preiynge, that we se youre face, and fulfille tho thingis that failen to youre feith.
29586	52	3	11	But God hym silf and oure fadir, and the Lord Jhesu Crist, dresse oure weye to you.
29587	52	3	12	And the Lord multiplie you, and make youre charite to be plenteuouse of ech to othere, and in to alle men, as also we in you;
29588	52	3	13	that youre hertis ben confermyd with outen pleynt in holynesse, bifor God and oure fadir, in the comyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist with alle hise seyntis. Amen.
29589	52	4	1	Therfor, britheren, fro hennus forward we preien you, and bisechen in the Lord Jhesu, that as ye han resseyued of vs, hou it bihoueth you to go and to plese God, so walke ye, that ye abounde the more.
29590	52	4	2	For ye witen what comaundementis Y haue youun to you bi the Lord Jhesu.
29591	52	4	3	For this is the wille of God, youre holynesse, that ye absteyne you fro fornycacioun.
29592	52	4	4	That ech of you kunne welde his vessel in holynesse, and onour;
29593	52	4	5	not in passioun of lust, as hethene men that knowen not God.
29594	52	4	6	And that no man ouergo, nethir disseyue his brothir in chaffaring. For the Lord is venger of alle these thingis, as we biforseiden to you, and han witnessid.
29595	52	4	7	For God clepide not vs in to vnclennesse, but in to holynesse.
29596	52	4	8	Therfor he that dispisith these thingis, dispisith not man, but God, that also yaf his holi spirit in vs.
29597	52	4	9	But of the charite of britherhed we hadden no nede to write to you; ye silf han lerud of God, that ye loue togidere;
29598	52	4	10	for ye don that in to alle britheren in al Macedonye. And, britheren, we preyen you, that ye abounde more; and taken kepe, that ye be quyet;
29599	52	4	11	and that ye do youre nede, and `ye worche with youre hoondis, as we han comaundid to you; and that ye wandre onestli to hem that ben with outforth, and that of no mannus ye desir ony thing.
29600	52	4	12	For, britheren, we wolen not, that ye vnknowe of men that dien, that ye be not soreuful, as othere that han not hope.
29601	52	4	13	For if we bileuen, that Jhesu was deed, and roos ayen, so God schal lede with hym hem that ben deed bi Jhesu.
29602	52	4	14	And we seien this thing to you in the word of the Lord, that we that lyuen, that ben left in the comyng of the Lord, schulen not come bifor hem that ben deed.
29603	52	4	15	For the Lord hym silf schal come doun fro heuene, in the comaundement, and in the vois of an archaungel, and in the trumpe of God; and the deed men that ben in Crist, schulen rise ayen first.
29604	52	4	16	Afterward we that lyuen, that ben left, schulen be rauyschid togidere with hem in cloudis, metinge Crist `in to the eir; and so euere more we schulen be with the Lord.
29605	52	4	17	Therfor be ye coumfortid togidere in these wordis.
29606	52	5	1	But, britheren, of tymes and momentis ye neden not that Y write to you.
29607	52	5	2	For ye silf witen diligentli, that the dai of the Lord schal come, as a theef in the niyt.
29608	52	5	3	For whanne thei schulen seie pees is, and sikirnesse, thanne sudeyn deth schal come on hem, as sorewe to a womman that is with child, and thei schulen not scape.
29609	52	5	4	But, britheren, ye ben not in derknessis, that the ilke dai as a theef catche you.
29610	52	5	5	For alle ye ben the sones of liyt, and sones of dai; we ben not of niyt, nether of derknessis.
29611	52	5	6	Therfor slepe we not as othere; but wake we, and be we sobre.
29612	52	5	7	For thei that slepen, slepen in the niyt, and thei that ben drunkun, ben drunkun in the niyt.
29613	52	5	8	But we that ben of the dai, ben sobre, clothid in the haburioun of feith and of charite, and in the helme of hope of heelthe.
29614	52	5	9	For God puttide not vs in to wraththe, but in to the purchasing of heelthe bi oure Lord Jhesu Crist, that was deed for vs;
29615	52	5	10	that whether we waken, whether we slepen, we lyue togidere with him.
29616	52	5	11	For which thing comforte ye togidere, and edefie ye ech other, as ye doon.
29617	52	5	12	And, britheren, we preien you, that ye knowen hem that trauelen among you, and ben souereyns to you in the Lord, and techen you,
29618	52	5	13	that ye han hem more aboundantli in charyte; and for the werk of hem, haue ye pees with hem.
29619	52	5	14	And, britheren, we preien you, repreue ye vnpesible men. Coumforte ye men of litil herte, resseyue ye sijke men, be ye pacient to alle men.
29620	52	5	15	Se ye, that no man yelde yuel for yuel to ony man; but euere more sue ye that that is good, ech to othere and to alle men.
29621	52	5	16	Euere more ioye ye; without ceessing preye ye;
29622	52	5	17	in alle thingis do ye thankyngis.
29623	52	5	18	For this is the wille of God in Crist Jhesu, in alle you.
29624	52	5	19	Nyle ye quenche the spirit;
29625	52	5	20	nyle ye dispise prophecies.
29626	52	5	21	But preue ye alle thingis, and holde ye that thing that is good.
29627	52	5	22	Absteyne you fro al yuel spice.
29628	52	5	23	And God hym silf of pees make you hooli bi alle thingis, that youre spirit be kept hool, and soule, and bodi, without pleynt, in the comyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
29629	52	5	24	God is trewe, that clepide you, which also schal do.
29630	52	5	25	Britheren, preye ye for vs.
29631	52	5	26	Grete ye wel alle britheren in hooli cos.
29632	52	5	27	Y coniure you bi the Lord, that this pistle be red to alle hooli britheren.
29633	52	5	28	The grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist be with you. Amen.
29634	53	1	1	Poul, and Siluan, and Tymothe, to the chirche of Tessalonicensis, in God oure fadir,
29635	53	1	2	and in the Lord Jhesu Crist, grace to you and pees of God, oure fadir, and of the Lord Jhesu Crist.
29636	53	1	3	We owen to do thankyngis eueremore to God for you, britheren, so as it is worthi, for youre feith ouer wexith, and the charite of ech of you to othere aboundith.
29637	53	1	4	So that we silf glorien in you in the chirchis of God, for youre pacience and feith in alle youre persecuciouns and tribulaciouns.
29638	53	1	5	Whiche ye susteynen in to the ensaumple of the iust dom of God, that ye be had worthi in the kingdom of God, for which ye suffren.
29639	53	1	6	If netheles it is iust tofor God to quite tribulacioun to hem that troblen you,
29640	53	1	7	and to you that ben troblid, rest with vs in the schewing of the Lord Jhesu fro heuene, with aungelis of his vertu,
29641	53	1	8	in the flawme of fier, that schal yyue veniaunce to hem that knowen not God, and that obeien not to the euangelie of oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
29642	53	1	9	Whiche schulen suffre euere lastinge peynes, in perischinge fro the face of the Lord, and fro the glorie of his vertu,
29643	53	1	10	whanne he schal come to be glorified in hise seyntis, and to be maad wondurful in alle men that bileueden, for oure witnessing is bileuyd on you, in that dai.
29644	53	1	11	In which thing also we preien euere more for you, that oure God make you worthi to his cleping, and fille al the wille of his goodnesse, and the werk of feith in vertu;
29645	53	1	12	that the name of oure Lord Jhesu Crist be clarified in you, and ye in hym, bi the grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
29646	53	2	1	But, britheren, we preien you bi the comyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, and of oure congregacioun in to the same comyng,
29647	53	2	2	that ye be not mouyd soone fro youre witt, nether be aferd, nether bi spirit, nether bi word, nether bi epistle as sent bi vs, as if the dai of the Lord be nyy.
29648	53	2	3	No man disseyue you in ony manere. For but dissencioun come first, and the man of synne be schewid, the sonne of perdicioun,
29649	53	2	4	that is aduersarie, and is enhaunsid ouer `al thing that is seid God, or that is worschipid, so that he sitte in the temple of God, and schewe hym silf as if he were God.
29650	53	2	5	Whether ye holden not, that yit whanne Y was at you, Y seide these thingis to you?
29651	53	2	6	And now what withholdith, ye witen, that he be schewid in his tyme.
29652	53	2	7	For the priuete of wickidnesse worchith now; oneli that he that holdith now, holde, til he be do awei.
29653	53	2	8	And thanne thilke wickid man schal be schewid, whom the Lord Jhesu schal sle with the spirit of his mouth, and schal distrie with liytnyng of his comyng;
29654	53	2	9	hym, whos comyng is bi the worching of Sathanas, in al vertu, and signes,
29655	53	2	10	and grete wondris, false, and in al disseit of wickidnesse, to hem that perischen. For that thei resseyueden not the charite of treuthe, that thei schulden be maad saaf. And therfor God schal sende to hem a worching of errour, that thei bileue to leesing,
29656	53	2	11	that alle be demed, whiche bileueden not to treuthe, but consentiden to wickidnesse.

29659	53	2	14	Therfor, britheren, stonde ye, and holde ye the tradiciouns, that ye han lerud, ethir bi word, ethir bi oure pistle.
29660	53	2	15	And oure Lord Jhesu Crist him silf, and God oure fadir, which louyde vs, and yaf euerlastinge coumfort and good hope in grace, stire youre hertis,
29661	53	2	16	and conferme in al good werk and word.
29662	53	3	1	Britheren, fro hennus forward preye ye for vs, that the word of God renne, and be clarified, as it is anentis you;
29663	53	3	2	and that we be delyuered fro noyous and yuele men; for feith is not of alle men.
29664	53	3	3	But the Lord is trewe, that schal conferme you, and schal kepe fro yuel.
29665	53	3	4	And, britheren, we trusten of you in the Lord, for what euere thingis we comaunden to you, bothe ye don and schulen do.
29666	53	3	5	And the Lord dresse youre hertis, in the charite of God, and in the pacience of Crist.
29667	53	3	6	But, britheren, we denouncen to you in the name of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, that ye withdrawe you from ech brother that wandrith out of ordre, and not aftir the techyng, that thei resseyueden of vs.
29668	53	3	7	For `ye silf witen, hou it bihoueth to sue vs. For we weren not vnpesible among you,
29669	53	3	8	nethir with outen oure owne trauel we eeten breed of ony man, but in trauel and werynesse worchiden niyt and dai, that we greuyden noon of you.
29670	53	3	9	Not as we hadden not power, but that we schulden yyue vs silf ensaumple to you to sue vs.
29671	53	3	10	For also whanne we weren among you, we denounsiden this thing to you, that if ony man wole not worche, nethir ete he.
29672	53	3	11	For we han herd that summe among you goon in reste, and no thing worchen, but don curiousli.
29673	53	3	12	But we denouncen to hem that ben suche men, and bisechen in the Lord Jhesu Crist, that thei worchen with silence, and ete her owne breed.
29674	53	3	13	But nyle ye, britheren, faile wel doynge.
29675	53	3	14	That if ony man obeie not to oure word bi epistle, marke ye him, and comyne ye not with hym, that he be schamed;
29676	53	3	15	and nyle ye gesse hym as an enemye, but repreue ye hym as a brother. And God hym silf of pees yyue to you euerlastinge pees in al place.
29677	53	3	16	The Lord be with `you alle.
29678	53	3	17	My salutacioun bi the hoond of Poul; which signe in ech epistle Y write thus.
29679	53	3	18	The grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist be with `alle you. Amen.
29680	54	1	1	Poul, apostle `of Jhesu Crist, bi the comaundement of God oure sauyour, and of Jhesu Crist oure hope,
29681	54	1	2	to Tymothe, bilouyd sone in the feith, grace and merci and pees, of God the fadir, and of Jhesu Crist, oure Lord.
29682	54	1	3	As Y preyede thee, that thou schuldist dwelle at Effesi, whanne Y wente into Macedonye, that thou schuldist denounce to summe men, that thei schulden not teche othere weie,
29683	54	1	4	nether yyue tent to fablis and genologies that ben vncerteyn, whiche yyuen questiouns, more than edificacioun of God, that is in the feith.
29684	54	1	5	For the ende of comaundement is charite of clene herte, and good conscience, and of feith not feyned.
29685	54	1	6	Fro whiche thingis sum men han errid, and ben turned in to veyn speche;
29686	54	1	7	and willith to be techeris of the lawe, and vndurstonden not what thingis thei speken, nether of what thingis thei affermen.
29687	54	1	8	And we witen that the lawe is good, if ony man vse it lawefulli;
29688	54	1	9	and witinge this thing, that the lawe is not set to a iust man, but to vniust men and not suget, to wickid men and to synneris, to cursid men and defoulid, to sleeris of fadir, and sleeris of modir, to `men sleeris and lechouris,
29689	54	1	10	to hem that don letcherie with men, lesingmongeris and forsworun, and if ony othere thing is contrarie to the hoolsum teching,
29690	54	1	11	that is aftir the euangelie of the glorie of blessid God, which is bitakun to me.
29691	54	1	12	Y do thankingis to hym, that coumfortide me in Crist Jhesu oure Lord, for he gesside me feithful, and putte me in mynystrie,
29692	54	1	13	that first was a blasfeme, and a pursuere, and ful of wrongis. But Y haue getun the merci of God, for Y vnknowinge dide in vnbileue.
29693	54	1	14	But the grace of oure Lord ouer aboundide, with feith and loue that is in Crist Jhesu.
29694	54	1	15	A trewe word and worthi al resseyuyng, for Crist Jhesu cam in to this world to make synful men saaf, of whiche Y am the firste.
29695	54	1	16	But therfor Y haue getun merci, that Crist Jhesu schulde schewe in me first al pacience, to the enfourmyng of hem that schulen bileue to hym in to euerlastinge lijf.
29696	54	1	17	And to the king of worldis, vndeedli and vnvysible God aloone, be onour and glorie in to worldis of worldis. Amen.
29697	54	1	18	I bitake this comaundement to thee, thou sone Timothe, after the prophecies that han be hertofore in thee, that thou traueile in hem a good trauel,
29698	54	1	19	hauynge feith and good conscience, which summen casten awei, and perischiden aboute the feith.
29699	54	1	20	Of whiche is Ymeneus and Alisaundre, which Y bitook to Sathanas, that thei lerne `to not blasfeme.
29700	54	2	1	Therfor Y biseche first of alle thingis, that bisechingis, preieris, axyngis, doyngis of thankyngis, ben maad for alle men,
29701	54	2	2	for kingis and alle that ben set in hiynesse, that we leden a quyet and a pesible lijf, in al pite and chastite.
29702	54	2	3	For this thing is good and acceptid bifor God,
29703	54	2	4	oure sauyour, that wole that alle men ben maad saaf, and that thei come to the knowyng of treuthe.
29704	54	2	5	For o God and a mediatour is of God and of men, a man Crist Jhesus,
29705	54	2	6	that yaf him silf redempcioun for alle men. Whos witnessing is confermyd in his tymes;
29706	54	2	7	in which Y am set a prechour and an apostle. For Y seye treuthe, and Y lie not, that am a techere of hethene men in feith and in treuthe.
29707	54	2	8	Therfor Y wole, that men preye in al place, liftinge vp clene hondis with outen wraththe and strijf.
29708	54	2	9	Also wymmen in couenable abite, with schamefastnesse and sobrenesse araiynge hem silf, not in writhun heeris, ethir in gold, ethir peerlis, ethir preciouse cloth; but that that bicometh wymmen,
29709	54	2	10	biheetinge pite bi good werkis.
29710	54	2	11	A womman lerne in silence, with al subieccioun.
29711	54	2	12	But Y suffre not a womman to teche, nether to haue lordschip on the hosebonde, but to be in silence.
29712	54	2	13	For Adam was first formed, aftirward Eue;
29713	54	2	14	and Adam was not disseyued, but the womman was disseyued, in breking of the lawe.
29714	54	2	15	But sche schal be sauyd bi generacioun of children, if sche dwellith perfitli in feith, and loue, and hoolynesse, with sobrenesse.
29715	54	3	1	A feithful word. If ony man desirith a bishopriche, he desirith a good werk.
29716	54	3	2	Therfor it bihoueth a byschop to be with out repreef, the hosebonde of o wijf, sobre, prudent, chast, vertewous, holdinge hospitalite, a techere;
29717	54	3	3	not youun myche to wyn, not a smytere, but temperat, not ful of chiding, not coueitouse, wel reulinge his hous,
29718	54	3	4	and haue sones suget with al chastite;
29719	54	3	5	for if ony man kan not gouerne his house, hou schal he haue diligence of the chirche of God? not new conuertid to the feith,
29720	54	3	6	lest he be borun vp in to pride, and falle in to doom of the deuel.
29721	54	3	7	For it bihoueth hym to haue also good witnessing of hem that ben with outforth, that he falle not in to repreef, and in to the snare of the deuel.
29722	54	3	8	Also it bihoueth dekenes to be chast, not double tungid, not youun myche to wyn, not suynge foul wynnyng;
29723	54	3	9	that han the mysterie of feith in clene conscience.
29724	54	3	10	But be thei preued first, and mynystre so, hauynge no cryme.
29725	54	3	11	Also it bihoueth wymmen to be chast, not bacbitinge, sobre, feithful in alle thingis.
29726	54	3	12	Dekenes be hosebondis of o wijf; whiche gouerne wel her sones and her housis.
29727	54	3	13	For thei that mynystren wel, schulen gete a good degre to hem silf, and myche triste in the feith, that is in Crist Jhesu.
29728	54	3	14	Sone Timothe, Y write to thee these thingis, hopinge that Y schal come soon to thee;
29729	54	3	15	but if Y tarie, that thou wite, hou it bihoueth thee to lyue in the hous of God, that is the chirche of lyuynge God, a pilere and sadnesse of treuthe.
29730	54	3	16	And opynli it is a greet sacrament of pitee, that thing that was schewid in fleisch, it is iustified in spirit, it apperid to aungels, it is prechid to hethene men, it is bileuyd in the world, it is takun vp in glorie.
29731	54	4	1	But the spirit seith opynli, that in the laste tymes summen schulen departe fro the feith, yyuynge tent to spiritis of errour, and to techingis of deuelis; that speken leesing in ipocrisie,
29732	54	4	2	and haue her conscience corrupt,
29733	54	4	3	forbedinge to be weddid, to absteyne fro metis, whiche God made to take with doyng of thankingis, to feithful men, and hem that han knowe the treuthe.
29734	54	4	4	For ech creature of God is good, and no thing is to be cast awei, which is takun with doyng of thankyngis;
29735	54	4	5	for it is halewid bi the word of God, and bi preyer.
29736	54	4	6	Thou puttynge forth these thingis to britheren, schalt be a good mynystre of Crist Jhesu; nurschid with wordis of feith and of good doctryne, which thou hast gete.
29737	54	4	7	But eschewe thou vncouenable fablis, and elde wymmenus fablis; haunte thi silf to pitee.
29738	54	4	8	For bodili exercitation is profitable to litle thing; but pitee is profitable to alle thingis, that hath a biheest of lijf that now is, and that is to come.
29739	54	4	9	A trewe word, and worthi al acceptacioun.
29740	54	4	10	And in this thing we trauelen, and ben cursid, for we hopen in lyuyng God, that is sauyour of alle men, moost of feithful men.
29741	54	4	11	Comaunde thou this thing, and teche.
29742	54	4	12	No man dispise thi yongthe, but be thou ensaumple of feithful men in word, in lyuyng, in charite, in feith, in chastite.
29743	54	4	13	Tyl Y come, take tent to redyng, to exortacioun and teching.
29744	54	4	14	Nyle thou litil charge the grace which is in thee, that is youun to thee bi profecie, with putting on of the hondis of preesthod.
29745	54	4	15	Thenke thou these thingis, in these be thou, that thi profiting be schewid to alle men.
29746	54	4	16	Take tent to thi silf and to doctryn; be bisi in hem. For thou doynge these thingis, schalt `make bothe thi silf saaf, and hem that heren thee.
29747	54	4	1	Blame thou not an eldere man, but biseche as a fadir, yonge men as britheren; elde wymmen as modris,
29748	54	4	2	yonge wymmen as sistris, in al chastite.
29749	54	5	3	Honoure thou widewis, that ben very widewis.
29750	54	5	4	But if ony widewe hath children of sones, lerne sche first to gouerne her hous, and quyte to fadir and modir; for this thing is acceptid bifor God.
29751	54	5	5	And sche that is a widewe verili, and desolate, hope in to God, and be bisy in bisechingis and preieris niyt and dai.
29752	54	5	6	For sche that is lyuynge in delicis, is deed.
29753	54	5	7	And comaunde thou this thing, that thei be withouten repreef.
29754	54	5	8	For if ony man hath not cure of his owne, and most of hise household men, he hath denyed the feith, and is worse than an vnfeithful man.
29755	54	5	9	A widewe be chosun not lesse than sixti yeer, that was wijf of oon hosebonde,
29756	54	5	10	and hath witnessing in good werkis, if sche nurschede children, if sche resseyuede pore men to herbore, if sche hath waischun the feet of hooli men, if sche mynystride to men that suffriden tribulacioun, if sche folewide al good werk.
29757	54	5	11	But eschewe thou yongere widewis; for whanne thei han do letcherie, thei wolen be weddid in Crist,
29758	54	5	12	hauynge dampnacioun, for thei han maad voide the firste feith.
29759	54	5	13	Also thei idil lernen to go aboute housis, not oneli ydel, but ful of wordis and curiouse, spekynge thingis that bihoueth not.
29760	54	5	14	Therfor Y wole, that yongere widewis be weddid, and bringe forth children, and ben hosewyues, to yyue noon occasioun to the aduersarie, bi cause of cursid thing.
29761	54	5	15	For now summe ben turned abak aftir Sathanas.
29762	54	5	16	If ony feithful man hath widewis, mynystre he to hem, that the chirche be not greuyd, that it suffice to hem that ben very widewis.
29763	54	5	17	The prestis that ben wel gouernoures, be thei had worthi to double onour; moost thei that trauelen in word and teching.
29764	54	5	18	For scripture seith, Thou schalt not bridil the mouth of the oxe threischinge, and, A werk man is worthi his hire.
29765	54	5	19	Nyle thou resseyue accusyng ayens a preest, but vndur tweyne or thre witnessis.
29766	54	5	20	But reproue thou men that synnen bifor alle men, that also othere haue drede.
29767	54	5	21	Y preie bifor God, and Jhesu Crist, and hise chosun aungelis, that thou kepe these thingis with oute preiudice, and do no thing in bowynge `in to the othere side.
29768	54	5	22	Put thou hondis to no man, nether anoon comyne thou with othere mennus synnes. Kepe thi silf chast.
29769	54	5	23	Nyle thou yit drinke watir, but vse a litil wyn, for thi stomac, and `for thin ofte fallynge infirmytees.
29770	54	5	24	Sum mennus synnes ben opyn, bifor goynge to dom; but of summen thei comen aftir.
29771	54	5	25	And also goode dedis ben opyn, and tho that han hem in othere maner, moun not be hid.
29772	54	6	1	What euere seruauntis ben vndur yok, deme thei her lordis worthi al onour, lest the name of the Lord and the doctryn be blasfemyd.
29773	54	6	2	And thei that han feithful lordis, dispise hem not, for thei ben britheren; but more serue thei, for thei ben feithful and louyd, whiche ben parceneris of benefice. Teche thou these thingis, and moneste thou these thingis.
29774	54	6	3	If ony man techith othere wise, and acordith not to the hoolsum wordis of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, and to that teching that is bi pitee,
29775	54	6	4	he is proud, and kan no thing, but langwischith aboute questiouns and stryuyng of wordis, of the whiche ben brouyt forth enuyes, stryues, blasfemyes, yuele suspiciouns, fiytingis of men,
29776	54	6	5	that ben corrupt in soule, and that ben pryued fro treuthe, that demen wynnyng to be pitee.
29777	54	6	6	But a greet wynnyng is pitee, with sufficience.
29778	54	6	7	For we brouyten in no thing in to this world, and no doute, that we moun not bere `awey ony thing.
29779	54	6	8	But we hauynge foodis, and with what thingus we schulen be hilid, be we paied with these thingis.
29780	54	6	9	For thei that wolen be maad riche, fallen in to temptacioun, and `in to snare of the deuel, and in to many vnprofitable desiris and noyous, whiche drenchen men in to deth and perdicioun.
29781	54	6	10	For the rote of alle yuelis is coueytise, which summen coueitinge erriden fro the feith, and bisettiden hem with many sorewis.
29782	54	6	11	But, thou, man of God, fle these thingis; but sue thou riytwisnesse, pite, feith, charite, pacience, myldenesse.
29783	54	6	12	Stryue thou a good strijf of feith, catche euerlastinge lijf, in to which thou art clepid, and hast knoulechid a good knouleching bifor many witnessis.
29784	54	6	13	I comaunde to thee bifor God, that quikeneth alle thingis, and bifor Crist Jhesu, that yeldide a witnessing vnder Pilat of Pounce, a good confessioun,
29785	54	6	14	that thou kepe the comaundement with out wem, with out repreef, in to the comyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist;
29786	54	6	15	whom the blessid and aloone miyti king of kyngis and Lord of lordis schal schewe in his tymes.
29787	54	6	16	Which aloone hath vndeedlynesse, and dwellith in liyt, to which no man may come; whom no man say, nether may se; to whom glorie, and honour, and empire be with out ende.
29788	54	6	17	Amen. Comaunde thou to the riche men of this world, that thei vndurstonde not hiyli, nether that thei hope in vncerteynte of richessis, but in the lyuynge God, that yyueth to vs alle thingis plenteuously to vse;
29789	54	6	18	to do wel, to be maad riche in good werkis, liytli to yyue,
29790	54	6	19	to comyne, to tresoure to hem silf a good foundement in to tyme to comynge, that thei catche euerlastinge lijf.
29791	54	6	20	Thou Tymothe, kepe the thing bitakun to thee, eschewynge cursid noueltees of voicis, and opynyouns of fals name of kunnyng;
29792	54	6	21	which summen bihetinge, aboute the feith fellen doun. The grace of God be with thee. Amen.
29793	55	1	1	Poul, apostle of Jhesu Crist, bi the wille of God, bi the biheest of lijf that is in Crist Jhesu,
29794	55	1	2	to Tymothe, his moost dereworthe sone, grace, merci, and pees of God the fadir, and of Jhesu Crist, oure Lord.
29795	55	1	3	I do thankyngis to my God, to whom Y serue fro my progenytouris in clene conscience, that with outen ceessyng Y haue mynde of thee in my preyeris,
29796	55	1	4	niyt and dai, desirynge to se thee; hauynge mynde of thi teeris, that Y be fillid with ioye.
29797	55	1	5	And Y bithenke of that feith, that is in thee not feyned, which also dwellide firste in thin aunte Loide, and in thi modir Eunyce. And Y am certeyn, that also in thee.
29798	55	1	6	For which cause Y moneste thee, that thou reise ayen the grace of God, that is in thee bi the settyng on of myn hondis.
29799	55	1	7	For whi God yaf not to vs the spirit of drede, but of vertu, and of loue, and of sobrenesse.
29800	55	1	8	Therfor nyl thou schame the witnessyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, nether me, his prisoner; but trauele thou togidere in the gospel bi the vertu of God;
29801	55	1	9	that delyueride vs, and clepide with his hooli clepyng, not after oure werkis, but bi his purpos and grace, that is youun in Crist Jhesu bifore worldli tymes;
29802	55	1	10	but now it is opyn bi the liytnyng of oure sauyour Jhesu Crist, which destriede deth, and liytnede lijf and vncorrupcioun bi the gospel.
29803	55	1	11	In which Y am set a prechour and apostle, and maistir of hethene men.
29804	55	1	12	For which cause also Y suffre these thingis; but Y am not confoundid. For Y woot to whom Y haue bileuyd, and Y am certeyne that he is miyti for to kepe that is take to my keping in to that dai.
29805	55	1	13	Haue thou the fourme of hoolsum wordis, whiche thou herdist of me in feith and loue in Crist Jhesu.
29806	55	1	14	Kepe thou the good takun to thi kepyng bi the Hooli Goost, that dwellith in vs.
29807	55	1	15	Thou wost this, that alle that ben in Asie ben turnyd awey fro me, of whiche is Figelus and Ermogenes.
29808	55	1	16	The Lord yyue merci to the hous of Onesyforus, for ofte he refreischide me, and schamyde not my chayne.
29809	55	1	17	But whanne he cam to Rome, he souyte me bisili, and foond.
29810	55	1	18	The Lord yyue to hym to fynde merci of God in that dai. And hou grete thingis he mynystride to me at Effesi, thou knowist betere.
29811	55	2	1	Therfor thou, my sone, be coumfortid in grace that is in Crist Jhesu.
29812	55	2	2	And what thingis thou hast herd of me bi many witnessis, bitake thou these to feithful men, whiche schulen `be also able to teche othere men.
29813	55	2	3	Trauele thou as a good knyyt of Crist Jhesu.
29814	55	2	4	No man holdinge knyythod to God, wlappith hym silf with worldli nedis, that he plese to hym, to whom he hath preuyd hym silf.
29815	55	2	5	For he that fiytith in a batel, schal not be corowned, but he fiyte lawfuli.
29816	55	2	6	It bihoueth an erthetiliere to resseyue first of the fruytis.
29817	55	2	7	Vndurstonde thou what thingis Y seie. For the Lord schal yyue to thee vndurstonding in alle thingis.
29818	55	2	8	Be thou myndeful that the Lord Jhesu Crist of the seed of Dauid hath rise ayen fro deth,
29819	55	2	9	aftir my gospel, in which Y trauele `til to boondis, as worching yuele, but the word of God is not boundun.
29820	55	2	10	Therfor Y suffre alle thingis for the chosun, that also thei gete the heelthe, that is in Crist Jhesu, with heuenli glorie.
29821	55	2	11	A trewe word, that if we ben deed togidere, also we schulen liue togidere;
29822	55	2	12	if we suffren, we schulen regne togidere; if we denyen, he schal denye vs;
29823	55	2	13	if we bileuen not, he dwellith feithful, he mai not denye hym silf.
29824	55	2	14	Teche thou these thingis, witnessinge bifore God. Nyle thou stryue in wordis; for to no thing it is profitable, but to the subuerting of men that heren.
29825	55	2	15	Bisili kepe to yyue thi silf a preued preisable werkman to God, with oute schame, riytli tretinge the word of treuthe.
29826	55	2	16	But eschewe thou vnhooli and veyn spechis, for whi tho profiten myche to vnfeithfulnesse,
29827	55	2	17	and the word of hem crepith as a canker. Of whiche Filete is, and Ymeneus,
29828	55	2	18	whiche felden doun fro the treuthe, seiynge that the rising ayen is now doon, and thei subuertiden the feith of summen.
29829	55	2	19	But the sad foundement of God stondith, hauynge this marke, The Lord knowith whiche ben hise, and, Ech man that nameth the name of the Lord, departith fro wickidnesse.
29830	55	2	20	But in a greet hous ben not oneli vessels of gold and of siluer, but also of tree and of erthe; and so summen ben in to onour, and summe in to dispit.
29831	55	2	21	Therfor if ony man clensith hym silf fro these, he schal be a vessel halewid in to onour, and profitable to the Lord, redi to al good werk.
29832	55	2	22	And fle thou desiris of yongthe, but sue thou riytwisnesse, feith, charite, pees, with hem that inwardli clepen the Lord of a clene herte.
29833	55	2	23	And eschewe thou foltische questiouns, and without kunnyng, wytynge that tho gendren chidyngis.
29834	55	2	24	But it bihoueth the seruaunt of the Lord to chide not; but to be mylde to alle men, able to teche,
29835	55	2	25	paciente, with temperaunce repreuynge hem that ayenstonden the treuthe, that sum tyme God yyue to hem forthenkyng, that thei knowen the treuthe,
29836	55	2	26	and that thei rise ayen fro the snares of the deuel, of whom thei ben holdun prisoneris at his wille.
29837	55	3	1	But wite thou this thing, that in the laste daies perelouse tymes schulen neiye, and men schulen be louynge hem silf,
29838	55	3	2	coueitouse, hiy of bering, proude, blasfemeris, not obedient to fadir and modir, vnkynde,
29839	55	3	3	cursid, with outen affeccioun, with out pees, false blameris, vncontynent, vnmylde,
29840	55	3	4	with out benygnyte, traitouris, ouerthwert, bollun with proude thouytis, blynde, loueris of lustis more than of God,
29841	55	3	5	hauynge the licknesse of pitee, but denyynge the vertu of it. And eschewe thou these men.
29842	55	3	6	Of these thei ben that persen housis, and leden wymmen caitifs chargid with synnes, whiche ben led with dyuerse desiris, euere more lernynge,
29843	55	3	7	and neuere perfitli comynge to the science of treuthe.
29844	55	3	8	And as Jannes and Mambres ayenstoden Moises, so these ayenstonden treuthe, men corrupt in vndirstonding, repreuyd aboute the feith.
29845	55	3	9	But ferthere thei schulen not profite, for the vnwisdom of hem schal be knowun to alle men, as hern was.
29846	55	3	10	But thou hast getun my teching, ordinaunce, purposing, feith, long abiding, loue,
29847	55	3	11	pacience, persecuciouns, passiouns, whiche weren maad to me at Antioche, at Ycony, at Listris, what maner persecucyouns Y suffride, and the Lord hath delyuered me of alle.
29848	55	3	12	And alle men that wolen lyue feithfuli in Crist Jhesu, schulen suffre persecucioun.
29849	55	3	13	But yuele men and disseyueris schulen encreese in to worse, errynge, and sendinge in to errour.
29850	55	3	14	But dwelle thou in these thingis that thou hast lerud, and that ben bitakun to thee, witinge of whom thou hast lerud;
29851	55	3	15	for thou hast knowun hooli lettris fro thi youthe, whiche moun lerne thee to heelthe, bi feith that is in Crist Jhesu.
29852	55	3	16	For al scripture inspirid of God is profitable to teche, to repreue, to chastice, to lerne in riytwisnes, that the man of God be parfit, lerud to al good werk.
29853	55	4	1	I witnesse bifore God and Crist Jhesu, that schal deme the quike and the deed, and bi the comyng of hym, and the kyngdom of hym,
29854	55	4	2	preche the word, be thou bisi couenabli with outen rest, repreue thou, biseche thou, blame thou in al pacience and doctryn.
29855	55	4	3	For tyme schal be, whanne men schulen not suffre hoolsum teching, but at her desiris thei schulen gadere `togidere to hem silf maistris yitchinge to the eeris.
29856	55	4	4	And treuli thei schulen turne awei the heryng fro treuthe, but to fablis thei schulen turne.
29857	55	4	5	But wake thou, in alle thingis traueile thou, do the werk of an euangelist, fulfille thi seruyce, be thou sobre.
29858	55	4	6	For Y am sacrifisid now, and the tyme of my departyng is nyy.
29859	55	4	7	Y haue stryuun a good strijf, Y haue endid the cours, Y haue kept the feith.
29860	55	4	8	In `the tothir tyme a coroun of riytwisnesse is kept to me, which the Lord, a iust domesman, schal yelde to me in that dai; and not oneli to me, but also to these that louen his comyng.
29861	55	4	9	Hyye thou to come to me soone. For Demas, louynge this world, hath forsakun me, and wente to Tessalonyk,
29862	55	4	10	Crescens in to Galathi, Tite in to Dalmacie;
29863	55	4	11	Luk aloone is with me. Take thou Mark, and brynge with thee; for he is profitable to me in to seruyce.
29864	55	4	12	Forsothe Y sente Titicus to Effesi.
29865	55	4	13	The cloth which Y lefte at Troade at Carpe, whanne thou comest, bringe with thee, and the bookis, but moost parchemyne.

29867	55	4	15	Whom also thou eschewe; for he ayenstood ful greetli oure wordis.
29868	55	4	16	In my firste defence no man helpide me, but alle forsoken me; be it not arettid to hem.
29869	55	4	17	But the Lord helpide me, and coumfortide me, that the preching be fillid bi me, and that alle folkis here, that Y am delyueride fro the mouth of the lioun.
29870	55	4	18	And the Lord delyueride me fro al yuel werk, and schal make me saaf in to his heuenly kingdom, to whom be glorie in to worldis of worldis.
29871	55	4	19	Amen. Grete wel Prisca, and Aquila, and the hous of Oneseforus.
29872	55	4	20	Erastus lefte at Corynthi, and Y lefte Trofymus sijk at Mylete.
29873	55	4	21	Hiye thou to come bifore wyntir. Eubolus, and Prudent, and Lynus, and Claudia, and alle britheren, greten thee wel.
29874	55	4	22	Oure Lord Jhesu Crist be with thi spirit. The grace of God be with you. Amen.
29875	56	1	1	Poul, the seruaunt of God, and apostle of Jhesu Crist, bi the feith of the chosun of God, and bi the knowing of the treuthe,
29876	56	1	2	whiche is aftir pitee, in to the hope of euerlastinge lijf, which lijf God that lieth not, bihiyte bifore tymes of the world;
29877	56	1	3	but he hath schewid in hise tymes his word in preching, that is bitakun to me bi the comaundement of `God oure sauyour,
29878	56	1	4	to Tite, most dereworthe sone bi the comyn feith, grace and pees of God the fadir, and of Crist Jhesu, oure sauyour.
29879	56	1	5	For cause of this thing Y lefte thee at Crete, that thou amende tho thingis that failen, and ordeyne preestis bi citees, as also Y disposide to thee.
29880	56	1	6	If ony man is withoute cryme, an hosebonde of o wijf, and hath feithful sones, not in accusacioun of letcherie, or not suget.
29881	56	1	7	For it bihoueth a bischop to be without cryme, a dispendour of God, not proud, not wrathful, not drunkelew, not smytere, not coueytouse of foul wynnyng;
29882	56	1	8	but holdinge hospitalite, benygne, prudent, sobre, iust,

29884	56	1	10	For ther ben many vnobedient, and veyn spekeris, and disseyueris, moost thei that ben of circumcisyoun,
29885	56	1	11	whiche it bihoueth to be repreued; whiche subuerten alle housis, techinge whiche thingis it bihoueth not, for the loue of foul wynnyng.
29886	56	1	12	And oon of hem, her propre profete, seide, Men of Crete ben euere more lyeris, yuele beestis, of slowe wombe.
29887	56	1	13	This witnessyng is trewe. For what cause blame hem sore, that thei be hool in feith,
29888	56	1	14	not yyuynge tent to fablis of Jewis, and to maundementis of men, that turnen awei hem fro treuthe.
29889	56	1	15	And alle thingis ben clene to clene men; but to vnclene men and to vnfeithful no thing is clene, for the soule and conscience of hem ben maad vnclene.
29890	56	1	16	Thei knoulechen that thei knowen God, but bi dedis thei denyen; whanne thei ben abhominable, and vnbileueful, and repreuable to al good werk.
29891	56	2	1	But speke thou tho thingis that bisemen hoolsum teching;

29898	56	2	8	An hoolsum word, and vnrepreuable; that he that is of the contrarie side, be aschamed, hauynge noon yuel thing to seie of you.
29899	56	2	9	Moneste thou seruauntis to be suget to her lordis; in alle thingis plesinge, not ayenseiynge, not defraudynge,
29900	56	2	10	but in alle thingis schewinge good feith, that thei onoure in alle thingis the doctryn of `God, oure sauyour.
29901	56	2	11	For the grace of `God, oure sauyour,
29902	56	2	12	hath apperid to alle men, and tauyte vs, that we forsake wickidnesse, and worldli desyris, lyue sobreli, and iustli, `and piteuousli in this world,

29904	56	2	14	that yaf hym silf for vs, to ayenbie vs fro al wickidnesse, and make clene to hym silf a puple acceptable, and suere of good werkis.
29905	56	2	15	Speke thou these thingis, and moneste thou, and repreue thou with al comaundement; no man dispise thee.
29906	56	3	1	Amoneste hem to be sugetis to prynces, and to poweris; to obeische to that that is seid, and to be redi to al good werk;
29907	56	3	2	to blasfeme no man, to be not ful of chiding, but temperat, schewynge al myldenesse to alle men.
29908	56	3	3	For we weren sum tyme vnwise, vnbileueful, errynge, and seruynge to desiris, and to dyuerse lustis, doynge in malice and enuye, worthi to be hatid, hatinge ech othere.
29909	56	3	4	But whanne the benygnyte and the manhed of oure sauyour God aperide,
29910	56	3	5	not of werkis of riytwisnesse that we diden, but bi his merci he made vs saaf, bi waischyng of ayen bigetyng, and ayen newyng of the Hooli Goost,

29913	56	3	8	A trewe word is, and of these thingis Y wole that thou conferme othere, that thei that bileuen to God, be bisy to be aboue othere in good werkis. These thingis ben good, and profitable to men.
29914	56	3	9	And eschewe thou foltische questiouns, and genologies, and stryues, and fiytyngis of the lawe; for tho ben vnprofitable and veyn.
29915	56	3	10	Eschewe thou a man eretik, aftir oon and the secound correccioun;
29916	56	3	11	witinge that he that is siche a maner man is subuertid, and trespassith, and is dampned bi his owne dom.
29917	56	3	12	Whanne Y sende to thee Arteman, or Titicus, hiy thou to `come to me to Nycopolis; for Y haue purposid to dwelle in wyntir there.
29918	56	3	13	Bisili byfor sende Zenam, a wise man of lawe, and Apollo, that no thing faile to hem.
29919	56	3	14	Thei that ben of ouris, lerne to be gouernouris in good werkis, to necessarie vsis, that thei be not with out fruyt.
29920	56	3	15	Alle men that ben with me greeten thee wel. Grete thou wel hem, that louen vs in feith. The grace of God be with you alle. Amen.
29921	57	1	1	Poul, the boundun of Crist Jhesu, and Timothe, brother, to Filemon, bilouyd, and oure helpere, and to Appia,
29922	57	1	2	most dere sister, and to Archip, oure euene kniyt, and to the chirche that is in thin hous,
29923	57	1	3	grace be to you, and pees of God oure fader, and of the Lord Jhesu Crist.
29924	57	1	4	I do thankingis to my God, euere more makinge mynde of thee in my preieris,
29925	57	1	5	heringe thi charite and feith, that thou hast in the Lord Jhesu, and to alle hooli men,
29926	57	1	6	that the comynyng of thi feith be maad opyn, in knowing of al good thing in Crist Jhesu.
29927	57	1	7	And Y hadde greet ioye and coumfort in thi charite, for the entrailis of hooli men restiden bi thee, brother.
29928	57	1	8	For which thing Y hauynge myche trist in Crist Jhesu, to comaunde to thee that that perteyneth to profit;
29929	57	1	9	but Y biseche more for charite, sithen thou art siche as the elde Poul, and now the boundun of Jhesu Crist.
29930	57	1	10	Y biseche thee for my sone Onesyme, whom Y in boondis bigat,
29931	57	1	11	which sumtyme was vnprofitable to thee, but now profitable bothe to thee and to me; whom Y sente ayen to thee.
29932	57	1	12	And resseyue thou hym as myn entrailis;
29933	57	1	13	whom Y wolde withholde with me, that he schulde serue for thee to me in boondis of the gospel;
29934	57	1	14	but with out thi counseil Y wolde not do ony thing, that thi good schulde not be as of nede, but wilful.
29935	57	1	15	For perauenture therfor he departide fro thee for a tyme, that thou schuldist resseyue hym with outen ende;
29936	57	1	16	now not as a seruaunt, but for a seruaunt a most dere brother, most to me; and how myche more to thee, bothe in fleisch and in the Lord?
29937	57	1	17	Therfor if thou hast me a felowe, resseyue hym as me; for if he hath ony thing anoied thee,
29938	57	1	18	ethir owith, arette thou this thing to me.
29939	57	1	19	Y Poul wroot with myn hoond, Y schal yelde; that Y seie not to thee, that also thou owist to me thi silf.
29940	57	1	20	So, brothir, Y schal vse thee in the Lord; fille thou myn entrails in Crist.
29941	57	1	21	Y tristnynge of thin obedience wroot to thee, witynge that thou schalt do ouer that that Y seie.
29942	57	1	22	Also make thou redi to me an hous to dwelle in; for Y hope that bi youre preyeris Y schal be youun to you.
29943	57	1	23	Epafras, prisoner with me in Crist Jhesu,
29944	57	1	24	greetith thee wel, and Mark, Aristark, Demas, Lucas, myn helperis.
29945	57	1	25	The grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist be with youre spirit. Amen.
29946	58	1	1	God, that spak sum tyme bi prophetis in many maneres to oure fadris, at the
29947	58	1	2	laste in these daies he hath spoke to vs bi the sone; whom he hath ordeyned eir of alle thingis, and bi whom he made the worldis.
29948	58	1	3	Which whanne also he is the briytnesse of glorie, and figure of his substaunce, and berith alle thingis bi word of his vertu, he makith purgacioun of synnes, and syttith on the riythalf of the maieste in heuenes;
29949	58	1	4	and so myche is maad betere than aungels, bi hou myche he hath eneritid a more dyuerse name bifor hem.
29950	58	1	5	For to whiche of the aungels seide God ony tyme, Thou art my sone, Y haue gendrid thee to dai? And eftsoone, Y schal be to hym in to a fadir, and he schal be to me in to a sone?
29951	58	1	6	And whanne eftsoone he bryngith in the firste bigetun sone in to the world, he seith, And alle the aungels of God worschipe hym.
29952	58	1	7	But he seith to aungels, He that makith hise aungels spiritis, and hise mynystris flawme of fier.
29953	58	1	8	But to the sone he seith, God, thi trone is in to the world of world; a yerde of equite is the yerde of thi rewme;
29954	58	1	9	thou hast louyd riytwisnesse, and hatidist wickidnesse; therfor the God, thi God, anoyntide thee with oile of ioye, more than thi felowis.
29955	58	1	10	And, Thou, Lord, in the bigynnyng foundidist the erthe, and heuenes ben werkis of thin hondis; thei schulen perische,
29956	58	1	11	but thou schalt perfitli dwelle; and alle schulen wexe elde as a cloth, and thou schalt chaunge hem as a cloth,
29957	58	1	12	and thei schulen be chaungid. But thou art the same thi silf, and thi yeeris schulen not faile.
29958	58	1	13	But to whiche of the aungels seide God at ony tyme, Sitte thou on my riythalf, till Y putte thin enemyes a stool of thi feet?
29959	58	1	14	Whether thei alle ben not seruynge spiritis, sente to seruen for hem that taken the eritage of heelthe?
29960	58	2	1	Therfor more plenteuousli it bihoueth vs to kepe tho thingis, that we han herd, lest perauenture we fleten awei.
29961	58	2	2	For if the ilke word that was seid bi aungels, was maad sad, and ech brekyng of the lawe and vnobedience took iust retribucioun of meede,
29962	58	2	3	hou schulen we ascape, if we despisen so greet an heelthe? Which, whanne it hadde takun bigynnyng to be teld out by the Lord, of hem that herden is confermyd in to vs.
29963	58	2	4	For God witnesside to gidere bi myraclis, and wondris, and grete merueilis, and dyuerse vertues, and departyngis of the Hooli Goost, bi his wille.
29964	58	2	5	But not to aungels God sugetide the world that is to comynge, of which we speken.
29965	58	2	6	But sum man witnesside in a place, and seide, What thing is man, that thou art myndeful of hym, or mannus sone, for thou visitist hym?
29966	58	2	7	Thou hast maad hym a litil lesse than aungels; thou hast corowned hym with glorie and onour; and thou hast ordeyned him on the werkis of thin hondis.
29967	58	2	8	Thou hast maad alle thingis suget vndur hise feet. And in that that he sugetide alle thingis to hym, he lefte no thing vnsuget to him. But now we seen not yit alle thingis suget to hym;
29968	58	2	9	but we seen hym that was maad a litil lesse than aungels, Jhesu, for the passioun of deth crowned with glorie and onour, that he thorouy grace of God schulde taste deth for alle men.
29969	58	2	10	For it bisemede hym, for whom alle thingis, and bi whom `alle thingis weren maad, which hadde brouyt many sones into glorie, and was auctour of the heelthe of hem, that he hadde an ende bi passioun.
29970	58	2	11	For he that halewith, and thei that ben halewid, ben alle of oon; for which cause he is not schamed to clepe hem britheren,
29971	58	2	12	seiynge, Y schal telle thi name to my britheren; in the myddil of the chirche Y schal herie thee.
29972	58	2	13	And eftsoone, Y schal be tristnynge in to hym; and eftsoone, Lo! Y and my children, whiche God yaf to me.
29973	58	2	14	Therfor for children comyneden to fleisch and blood, and he also took part of the same, that bi deth he schulde destrie hym that hadde lordschipe of deth, that is to seie, the deuel,
29974	58	2	15	and that he schulde delyuere hem that bi drede of deth, `bi al lijf weren boundun to seruage.
29975	58	2	16	And he took neuere aungelis, but he took the seed of Abraham.
29976	58	2	17	Wherfor he ouyte to be likned to britheren bi alle thingis, that he schulde be maad merciful and a feithful bischop to God, that he schulde be merciful to the trespassis of the puple.
29977	58	2	18	For in that thing in which he suffride, and was temptid, he is miyti to helpe also hem that ben temptid.
29978	58	3	1	Therfor, hooli britheren, and parceneris of heuenli cleping, biholde ye the apostle and the bischop of oure confessioun, Jhesu,
29979	58	3	2	which is trewe to hym that made hym, as also Moises in al the hous of hym.
29980	58	3	3	But this byschop is had worthi of more glorie than Moises, bi as myche as he hath more honour of the hous, that made the hous.
29981	58	3	4	For ech hous is maad of sum man; he that made alle thingis of nouyt is God.
29982	58	3	5	And Moises was trewe in al his hous, as a seruaunt, in to witnessyng of tho thingis that weren to be seid;
29983	58	3	6	but Crist as a sone in his hous. Which hous we ben, if we holden sad trist and glorie of hope in to the ende.
29984	58	3	7	Wherfor as the Hooli Goost seith, To dai, if ye han herd his vois, nyle ye hardne youre hertis,
29985	58	3	8	as in wraththing, lijk the dai of temptacioun in desert;
29986	58	3	9	where youre fadris temptiden me, and preueden, and siyen my werkis fourti yeeris.
29987	58	3	10	Wherfor Y was wrooth to this generacioun, and Y seide, Euere more thei erren in herte, for thei knewen not my weies;
29988	58	3	11	to whiche Y swore in my wraththe, thei schulen not entre in to my reste.
29989	58	3	12	Britheren, se ye, lest perauenture in ony of you be an yuel herte of vnbileue, to departe fro the lyuynge God.
29990	58	3	13	But moneste you silf bi alle daies, the while to dai is named, that noon of you be hardned bi fallas of synne.
29991	58	3	14	For we ben maad parceneris of Crist, if netheles we holden the bigynnyng of his substaunce sad in to the ende.
29992	58	3	15	While it is seid, to dai, if ye han herd the vois of hym, nyle ye hardne youre hertis, as in that wraththing.
29993	58	3	16	For summen heringe wraththiden, but not alle thei that wenten out of Egipt bi Moises.
29994	58	3	17	But to whiche was he wraththid fourti yeeris? Whether not to hem that synneden, whos careyns weren cast doun in desert?
29995	58	3	18	And to whiche swoor he, that thei schulden not entre in to the reste of hym, not but to hem that weren vnbileueful?
29996	58	3	19	And we seen, that thei myyten not entre in to the reste of hym for vnbileue.
29997	58	4	1	Therfor drede we, lest perauenture while the biheest of entryng in to his reste is left, that ony of vs be gessid to be awei.
29998	58	4	2	For it is told also to vs, as to hem. And the word that was herd profitide not to hem, not meynd to feith of tho thingis that thei herden.
29999	58	4	3	For we that han bileued, schulen entre in to reste, as he seide, As Y swoor in my wraththe, thei schulen not entre in to my reste. And whanne the werkis weren maad perfit at the ordynaunce of the world,
30000	58	4	4	he seide thus in a place of the seuenthe dai, And God restide in the seuenthe dai from alle hise werkis.
30001	58	4	5	And in this place eftsoone, Thei schulen not entre in to my reste.
30002	58	4	6	Therfor for it sueth, that summen schulen entre in to it, and thei to whiche it was teld to bifor, entriden not for her vnbileue.
30003	58	4	7	Eftsoone he termyneth sum dai, and seith in Dauith, To dai, aftir so myche tyme of tyme, as it is biforseid, To dai if ye han herd his vois, nyle ye hardne youre hertis.
30004	58	4	8	For if Jhesus hadde youun reste to hem, he schulde neuere speke of othere aftir this dai.
30005	58	4	9	Therfor the sabat is left to the puple of God.
30006	58	4	10	For he that is entrid in to his reste, restide of hise werkis, as also God of hise.
30007	58	4	11	Therfor haste we to entre in to that reste, that no man falle in to the same ensaumple of vnbileue. For the word of God is quyk,
30008	58	4	12	and spedi in worching, and more able to perse than any tweyne eggid swerd, and stretchith forth to the departynge of the soule and of the spirit, and of the ioynturis and merewis, and demere of thouytis, and of intentis and hertis.
30009	58	4	13	And no creature is vnuisible in the siyt of God. For alle thingis ben nakid and opyn to hise iyen, to whom a word to vs.
30010	58	4	14	Therfor we that han a greet bischop, that perside heuenes, Jhesu, the sone of God, holde we the knoulechyng of oure hope.
30011	58	4	15	For we han not a bischop, that may not haue compassioun on oure infirmytees, but was temptid bi alle thingis bi lycnesse, with oute synne.
30012	58	4	16	Therfor go we with trist to the trone of his grace, that we gete merci, and fynde grace in couenable help.
30013	58	5	1	For ech bischop takun of men, is ordeyned for men in these thingis `that ben to God, that he offre yiftis and sacrifices for synnes.
30014	58	5	2	Which may togidere sorewe with hem, that beth vnkunnynge and erren; for also he is enuyrounned with infirmytee.
30015	58	5	3	And therfor he owith, as for the puple, so also for hym silf, to offre for synnes.
30016	58	5	4	Nethir ony man taketh to hym onour, but he that is clepid of God, as Aaron was.
30017	58	5	5	So Crist clarifiede not hym silf, that he were bischop, but he that spak to hym, Thou art my sone, to dai Y gendride thee.
30018	58	5	6	As `in anothere place he seith, Thou art a prest with outen ende, aftir the ordre of Melchisedech.
30019	58	5	7	Which in the daies of his fleisch offride, with greet cry and teeris, preieris and bisechingis to hym that myyte make hym saaf fro deth, and was herd for his reuerence.
30020	58	5	8	And whanne he was Goddis sone, he lernyde obedience of these thingis that be suffride;
30021	58	5	9	and he brouyt to the ende is maad cause of euerlastinge heelthe to alle that obeischen to hym, and is clepid of God a bischop,
30022	58	5	10	bi the ordre of Melchisedech.
30023	58	5	11	Of whom ther is to vs a greet word for to seie, and able to be expowned, for ye ben maad feble to here.
30024	58	5	12	For whanne ye ouyten to be maistris for tyme, eftsoone ye neden that ye be tauyt, whiche ben the lettris of the bigynnyng of Goddis wordis. And ye ben maad thilke, to whiche is nede of mylk, and not sad mete.
30025	58	5	13	For ech that is parcenere of mylk, is with out part of the word of riytwisnesse, for he is a litil child.
30026	58	5	14	But of perfit men is sad mete, of hem that for custom han wittis exercisid to discrecioun of good and of yuel.
30027	58	6	1	Therfor we bringinge in a word of the bigynnyng of Crist, be we borun to the perfeccioun of hym, not eftsoone leggynge the foundement of penaunce fro deed werkis, and of the feith to God, and of teching of baptimys,
30028	58	6	2	and of leiynge on of hondis, and of risyng ayen of deed men, and of the euerlastinge doom.
30029	58	6	3	And this thing we schulen do, if God schal suffre.
30030	58	6	4	But it is impossible, that thei that ben onys liytned, and `han tastid also an heuenly yifte, and ben maad parceneris of the Hooli Goost,
30031	58	6	5	and netheles han tastid the good word of God, and the vertues of the world to comynge, and ben slidun fer awei,
30032	58	6	6	that thei be renewid eftsoone to penaunce. Whiche eftsones crucifien to hem silf the sone of God, and han to scorn.
30033	58	6	7	For the erthe that drinkith reyn ofte comynge on it, and bringith forth couenable erbe to hem of whiche it is tilid, takith blessing of God.
30034	58	6	8	But that that is bringinge forth thornes and breris, is repreuable, and next to curs, whos endyng schal be in to brennyng.
30035	58	6	9	But, ye moost dereworthe, we tristen of you betere thingis, and neer to helthe, thouy we speken so.
30036	58	6	10	For God is not vniust, that he foryete youre werk and loue, whiche ye han schewid in his name; for ye han mynystrid to seyntis, `and mynistren.
30037	58	6	11	And we coueiten that ech of you schewe the same bisynesse to the fillyng of hope in to the ende;
30038	58	6	12	that ye be not maad slowe, but also sueris of hem, whiche bi feith and pacience schulen enherite the biheestis.
30039	58	6	13	For God bihetinge to Abraham, for he hadde noon grettere, bi whom he schulde swere, swoor bi hym silf,
30040	58	6	14	and seide, Y blessinge schal blesse thee, and Y multipliynge schal multiplie thee;
30041	58	6	15	and so he long abidinge hadde the biheeste.
30042	58	6	16	For men sweren bi a grettere than hem silf, and the ende of al her ple is an ooth to confirmacioun.
30043	58	6	17	In which thing God willynge to schewe plenteuouslier to the eiris of his biheest the sadnesse of his counsel,
30044	58	6	18	puttide bitwixe an ooth, that bi twey thingis vnmeuable, bi whiche it is impossible that God lie, we han a strengeste solace, `we that fleen togidere to holde the hope that is put forth to vs.
30045	58	6	19	Which hope as an ankir we han sikir to the soule, and sad, and goynge in to the ynnere thingis of hiding;
30046	58	6	20	where the bifore goere, Jhesus, that is maad bischop with outen ende bi the ordre of Melchisedech, entride for vs.
30047	58	7	1	And this Melchisedech, king of Salem, and preest of the hiyeste God, which mette with Abraham, as he turnede ayen fro the sleyng of kyngis, and blesside hym;
30048	58	7	2	to whom also Abraham departide tithis of alle thingis; first he is seid king of riytwisnesse, and aftirward kyng of Salem, that is to seie, king of pees,
30049	58	7	3	with out fadir, with out modir, with out genologie, nether hauynge bigynnyng of daies, nether ende of lijf; and he is lickened to the sone of God, and dwellith preest with outen ende.
30050	58	7	4	But biholde ye how greet is this, to whom Abraham the patriark yaf tithis of the beste thingis.
30051	58	7	5	For men of the sones of Leuy takinge presthod han maundement to take tithis of the puple, bi the lawe, that is to seie, of her britheren, thouy also thei wenten out of the leendis of Abraham.
30052	58	7	6	But he whos generacioun is not noumbrid in hem, took tithis of Abraham; and he blesside this Abraham, which hadde repromyssiouns.
30053	58	7	7	With outen ony ayenseiyng, that that is lesse, is blessid of the betere.
30054	58	7	8	And heere deedli men taken tithis; but there he berith witnessyng, that he lyueth.
30055	58	7	9	And that it be seid so, bi Abraham also Leuy, that took tithis, was tithid; and yit he was in his fadris leendis,
30056	58	7	10	whanne Melchisedech mette with hym.
30057	58	7	11	Therfor if perfeccioun was bi the preesthood of Leuy, for vndur hym the puple took the lawe, what yit was it nedeful, another preest to rise, bi the ordre of Melchisedech, and not to be seid bi the ordre of Aaron?
30058	58	7	12	For whi whanne the preesthod is translatid, it is nede that also translacioun of the lawe be maad.
30059	58	7	13	But he in whom these thingis ben seid, is of another lynage, of which no man was preest to the auter.
30060	58	7	14	For it is opyn, that oure Lord is borun of Juda, in which lynage Moises spak no thing of preestis.
30061	58	7	15	And more yit it is knowun, if bi the ordre of Melchisedech another preest is risun vp;
30062	58	7	16	which is not maad bi the lawe of fleischli maundement, but bi vertu of lijf that may not be vndon.
30063	58	7	17	For he witnessith, That thou art a preest with outen ende, bi the ordre of Melchisedech;
30064	58	7	18	that repreuyng of the maundement bifor goynge is maad, for the vnsadnesse and vnprofit of it.
30065	58	7	19	For whi the lawe brouyt no thing to perfeccioun, but there is a bringing in of a betere hope, bi which we neiyen to God.
30066	58	7	20	And hou greet it is, not with out sweryng; but the othere ben maad preestis with outen an ooth;
30067	58	7	21	but this preest with an ooth, bi hym that seide `to hym, The Lord swoor, and it schal not rewe hym, Thou art a preest with outen ende, bi the ordre of Melchisedech;
30068	58	7	22	in so myche Jhesus is maad biheetere of the betere testament.
30069	58	7	23	And the othere weren maad manye preestis, `therfor for thei weren forbedun bi deth to dwelle stille;
30070	58	7	24	but this, for he dwellith with outen ende, hath an euerlastynge preesthod.
30071	58	7	25	Wherfor also he may saue with outen ende, comynge nyy bi hym silf to God, and euermore lyueth to preye for vs.
30072	58	7	26	For it bisemyde that sich a man were a bischop to vs, hooli, innocent, vndefoulid, clene, departid fro synful men, and maad hiyere than heuenes;
30073	58	7	27	which hath not nede ech dai, as prestis, first for hise owne giltis to offre sacrifices, and aftirward for the puple; for he dide this thing in offringe hym silf onys.
30074	58	7	28	And the lawe ordeynede men prestis hauynge sijknesse; but the word of swering, which is after the lawe, ordeynede the sone perfit with outen ende.
30075	58	8	1	But a capitle on tho thingis that ben seid. We han siche a bischop, that sat in the riythalf of the seete of greetnesse in heuenes,
30076	58	8	2	the mynystre of seyntis, and of the veri tabernacle, that God made, and not man.
30077	58	8	3	For ech bischop is ordeyned to offre yiftis and sacrificis; wherfor it is nede, that also this bischop haue sum thing that he schal offre.
30078	58	8	4	Therfor if he were on erthe, he were no preest, whanne ther weren that schulden offre yiftis bi the lawe,
30079	58	8	5	whiche seruen to the saumpler and schadewe of heueneli thingis. As it was answerid to Moises, whanne he schulde ende the tabernacle, Se, he seide, make thou alle thingis bi the saumpler, that is schewid to thee in the mount.
30080	58	8	6	But now he hath getun a betere mynysterie, bi so myche as he is a mediatour of a betere testament, which is confermyd with betere biheestis.
30081	58	8	7	For if the ilke firste hadde lackid blame, the place of the secounde schulde not haue be souyt.
30082	58	8	8	For he repreuynge hem seith, Lo! daies comen, seith the Lord, and Y schal make perfit a newe testament on the hous of Israel, and on the hous of Juda;
30083	58	8	9	not lijk the testament that Y made to her fadris, `in the dai in which Y cauyte her hond, that Y schulde lede hem out of the loond of Egipt; for thei dwelliden not perfitli in my testament, and Y haue dispisid hem, seith the Lord.
30084	58	8	10	But this is the testament, which Y schal dispose to the hous of Israel aftir tho daies, seith the Lord, in yyuynge my lawis in to the soulis of hem, and in to the hertis of hem I schal aboue write hem; and Y schal be to hem in to a God, and they schulen be to me in to a puple.
30085	58	8	11	And ech man schal not teche his neiyebore, and ech man his brother, seiynge, Knowe thou the Lord; for alle men schulen knowe me, fro the lesse to the more of hem.
30086	58	8	12	For Y schal be merciful to the wickidnesse of hem, and now Y schal not bithenke on the synnes of hem.
30087	58	8	13	But in seiynge a newe, the formere wexide eeld; and that that is of many daies, and wexith eeld, is nyy the deeth.
30088	58	9	1	And the former testament hadde iustefiyngis of worschip, and hooli thing duringe for a tyme.
30089	58	9	2	For the tabernacle was maad first, in which weren candilstikis, and boord, and setting forth of looues, which is seid hooli.
30090	58	9	3	And after the veil, the secounde tabernacle, that is seid sancta sanctorum, that is, hooli of hooli thingis;
30091	58	9	4	hauynge a goldun cenrer, and the arke of the testament, keuered aboute on ech side with gold, in which was a pot of gold hauynge manna, and the yerde of Aaron that florischide, and the tablis of the testament;
30092	58	9	5	on whiche thingis weren cherubyns of glorie, ouerschadewinge the propiciatorie; of whiche thingis it is not now to seie bi alle.
30093	58	9	6	But whanne these weren maad thus togidere, preestis entriden eueremore in the formere tabernacle, doynge the offices of sacrifices; but in the secounde tabernacle,
30094	58	9	7	the bischop entride onys in the yeer, not without blood, which he offride for his ignoraunce and the puplis.
30095	58	9	8	For the Hooli Goost signefiede this thing, that not yit the weie of seyntis was openyd, while the formere tabernacle hadde staat.
30096	58	9	9	Which parable is of this present tyme, bi which also yiftis and sacrifices ben offrid, whiche moun not make a man seruynge perfit bi conscience, oneli in metis,
30097	58	9	10	and drynkis, and dyuerse waischingis, and riytwisnessis of fleisch, that weren sett to the tyme of correccioun.
30098	58	9	11	But Crist beynge a bischop of goodis to comynge, entride bi a largere and perfitere tabernacle, not maad bi hoond, that is to seye,
30099	58	9	12	not of this makyng, nether bi blood of goot buckis, or of calues, but bi his owne blood, entride onys in to the hooli thingis, that weren foundun bi an euerlastinge redempcioun.
30100	58	9	13	For if the blood of gootbuckis, and of boolis, and the aische of a cow calf spreynd, halewith vnclene men to the clensing of fleisch,
30101	58	9	14	hou myche more the blood of Crist, which bi the Hooli Goost offride hym silf vnwemmyd to God, schal clense oure conscience fro deed werkis, to serue God that lyueth?
30102	58	9	15	And therfor he is a mediatour of the newe testament, that bi deth fallinge bitwixe, in to redempcioun of tho trespassyngis that weren vndur the formere testament, thei that ben clepid take the biheest of euerlastinge eritage.
30103	58	9	16	For where a testament is, it is nede, that the deth of the testament makere come bitwixe.
30104	58	9	17	For a testament is confermed in deed men; ellis it is not worthe, while he lyueth, that made the testament.
30105	58	9	18	Wherfor nether the firste testament was halewid without blood.
30106	58	9	19	For whanne ech maundement of the lawe was red of Moises to al the puple, he took the blood of calues, and of buckis of geet, with watir, and reed wolle, and ysope, and bispreynde bothe thilke book and al the puple,
30107	58	9	20	and seide, This is the blood of the testament, that God comaundide to you.
30108	58	9	21	Also he spreynde with blood the tabernacle, and alle the vessels of the seruyce in lijk maner.
30109	58	9	22	And almest alle thingis ben clensid in blood bi the lawe; and without scheding of blood remyssioun of synnes is not maad.
30110	58	9	23	Therfor it is nede, that the saumpleris of heuenli thingis be clensid with these thingis; but thilke heuenli thingis with betere sacrificis than these.
30111	58	9	24	For Jhesus entride not in to hooli thingis maad bi hoondis, that ben saumpleris of very thingis, but in to heuene it silf, that he appere now to the cheer of God for vs; nether that he offre him silf ofte,
30112	58	9	25	as the bischop entride in to hooli thingis bi alle yeeris in alien blood,
30113	58	9	26	ellis it bihofte hym to suffre ofte fro the bigynnyng of the world; but now onys in the ending of worldis, to distruccioun of synne bi his sacrifice he apperide.
30114	58	9	27	And as it is ordeynede to men,
30115	58	9	28	onys to die, but aftir this is the dom, so Crist was offrid onys, to auoyde the synnes of many men; the secounde tyme he schal appere with outen synne to men that abiden him in to heelthe.
30116	58	10	1	For the lawe hauinge a schadewe of good thingis `that ben to come, not the ilke image of thingis, mai neuer make men neiyinge perfit bi the ilke same sacrifices, which thei offren without ceessing bi alle yeeris;
30117	58	10	2	ellis thei schulden haue ceessid to be offrid, for as myche as the worschiperis clensid onys, hadden not ferthermore conscience of synne.
30118	58	10	3	But in hem mynde of synnes is maad bi alle yeris.
30119	58	10	4	For it is impossible that synnes be doon awei bi blood of boolis, and of buckis of geet.
30120	58	10	5	Therfor he entrynge in to the world, seith, Thou woldist not sacrifice and offryng; but thou hast schapun a bodi to me;
30121	58	10	6	brent sacrificis also for synne plesiden not to thee.
30122	58	10	7	Thanne Y seide, Lo! Y come; in the bigynnyng of the book it is writun of me, that Y do thi wille, God.
30123	58	10	8	He seiynge bifor, That thou woldist not sacrificis, and offringis, and brent sacrifices for synne, ne tho thingis ben plesaunt to thee, whiche ben offrid bi the lawe,
30124	58	10	9	thanne Y seide, Lo! Y come, that Y do thi wille, God. He doith awei the firste, that he make stidfast the secounde.
30125	58	10	10	In which wille we ben halewid bi the offring of the bodi of Crist Jhesu onys.
30126	58	10	11	And ech prest is redi mynystrynge ech dai, and ofte tymes offringe the same sacrifices, whiche moun neuere do awei synnes.
30127	58	10	12	But this man offringe o sacrifice for synnes, for euere more sittith in the riythalf of God the fadir;
30128	58	10	13	fro thennus forth abidinge, til hise enemyes ben put a stool of hise feet.
30129	58	10	14	For bi oon offring he made perfit for euere halewid men.
30130	58	10	15	And the Hooli Goost witnessith to vs; for aftir that he seide, This is the testament,
30131	58	10	16	which Y schal witnesse to hem after tho daies, the Lord seith, in yyuynge my lawes in the hertis of hem, and in the soulis of hem Y schal aboue write hem;
30132	58	10	17	and now Y schal no more thenke on the synnes and the wickidnessis of hem.
30133	58	10	18	And where remyssioun of these is, now is ther noon offring for synne.
30134	58	10	19	Therfor, britheren, hauynge trist in to the entring of hooli thingis in the blood of Crist,
30135	58	10	20	which halewide to vs a newe weie, and lyuynge bi the hiling, that is to seie,
30136	58	10	21	his fleisch, and we hauynge the greet preest on the hous of God,
30137	58	10	22	neiye we with very herte in the plente of feith; and be oure hertis spreined fro an yuel conscience, and oure bodies waischun with clene watir,
30138	58	10	23	and holde we the confessioun of oure hope, bowinge to no side; for he is trewe that hath made the biheeste.
30139	58	10	24	And biholde we togidere in the stiring of charite and of good werkis; not forsakinge oure gadering togidere,
30140	58	10	25	as it is of custom to sum men, but coumfortinge, and bi so myche the more, bi hou myche ye seen the dai neiyynge.
30141	58	10	26	Forwhi now a sacrifice for synnes is not left to vs, that synnen wilfuli, aftir that we han take the knowyng of treuthe.
30142	58	10	27	Forwhi sum abiding of the dom is dreedful, and the suyng of fier, which schal waste aduersaries.
30143	58	10	28	Who that brekith Moises lawe, dieth withouten ony merci, bi tweine or thre witnessis;
30144	58	10	29	hou myche more gessen ye, that he disserueth worse turmentis, which defouleth the sone of God, and holdith the blood of the testament pollut, in which he is halewid, and doith dispit to the spirit of grace?
30145	58	10	30	For we knowen him that seide, To me veniaunce, and Y schal yelde. And eft, For the Lord schal deme his puple.
30146	58	10	31	It is ferdful to falle in to the hondis of God lyuynge.
30147	58	10	32	And haue ye mynde on the formere daies, in which ye weren liytned, and suffriden greet strijf of passiouns.
30148	58	10	33	And in the `tothir ye weren maad a spectacle bi schenschipis and tribulaciouns; in an othir ye weren maad felowis of men lyuynge so.
30149	58	10	34	For also to boundun men ye hadden compassioun, and ye resseyueden with ioye the robbyng of youre goodis, knowinge that ye han a betere and a dwellinge substaunce.
30150	58	10	35	Therfor nyle ye leese youre trist, which hath greet rewarding.
30151	58	10	36	For pacience is nedeful to you, that ye do the wille of God, and bringe ayen the biheest.
30152	58	10	37	For yit a litil, and he that is to comynge schal come, and he schal not tarie.
30153	58	10	38	For my iust man lyueth of feith; that if he withdrawith hym silf, he schal not plese to my soule.
30154	58	10	39	But we ben not the sones of withdrawing awei in to perdicioun, but of feith in to getynge of soule.
30155	58	11	1	But feith is the substaunce of thingis that ben to be hopid, and an argument of thingis not apperynge.
30156	58	11	2	And in this feith elde men han gete witnessyng.
30157	58	11	3	Bi feith we vndurstonden that the worldis weren maad bi Goddis word, that visible thingis weren maad of vnuysible thingis.
30158	58	11	4	Bi feith Abel offride a myche more sacrifice than Caym to God, bi which he gat witnessyng to be iust, for God bar witnessyng to hise yiftis; and bi that feith he deed spekith yit.
30159	58	11	5	Bi feith Ennok was translatid, that he schulde not se deth; and he was not foundun, for the Lord translatide him. For bifore translacioun he hadde witnessing that he pleside God.
30160	58	11	6	And it is impossible to plese God without feith. For it bihoueth that a man comynge to God, bileue that he is, and that he is rewardere to men that seken hym.
30161	58	11	7	Bi feith Noe dredde, thorouy answere takun of these thingis that yit weren not seyn, and schapide a schip in to the helthe of his hous; bi which he dampnede the world, and is ordeyned eir of riytwisnesse, which is bi feith.
30162	58	11	8	By feith he that is clepid Abraham, obeiede to go out in to a place, whiche he schulde take in to eritage; and he wente out, not witinge whidur he schulde go.
30163	58	11	9	Bi feith he dwelte in the loond of biheest, as in an alien loond, dwellynge in litle housis with Ysaac and Jacob, euene heiris of the same biheest.
30164	58	11	10	For he abood a citee hauynge foundementis, whos crafti man and maker is God.
30165	58	11	11	Bi feith also the ilke Sara bareyn, took vertu in consceyuyng of seed, yhe, ayen the tyme of age; for sche bileuede hym trewe, that hadde bihiyte.
30166	58	11	12	For which thing of oon, and yit nyy deed, ther ben borun as sterris of heuene in multitude, and as grauel that is at the see side out of noumbre.
30167	58	11	13	Bi feith alle these ben deed, whanne the biheestis weren not takun, but thei bihelden hem afer, and gretynge hem wel, and knoulechide that thei weren pilgryms, and herboryd men on the erthe.
30168	58	11	14	And thei that sayn these thingis, signifien that thei sechen a cuntre.
30169	58	11	15	`If thei hadden hadde mynde of the ilke, of which thei wenten out, thei hadden tyme of turnyng ayen;
30170	58	11	16	but now thei desiren a betere, that is to seie, heuenli. Therfor God is not confoundid to be clepid the God of hem; for he made redi to hem a citee.
30171	58	11	17	Bi feith Abraham offride Ysaac, whanne he was temptid; and he offride the oon bigetun, whych had takun the biheestis;
30172	58	11	18	to whom it was seid, For in Ysaac the seed schal be clepid to thee.
30173	58	11	19	For he demyde, that God is myyti to reise hym, yhe, fro deth; wherfor he took hym also in to a parable.
30174	58	11	20	Bi feith also of thingis to comynge, Ysaac blesside Jacob and Esau.
30175	58	11	21	Bi feith Jacob diynge blesside alle the sones of Joseph, and onouride the hiynesse of his yerde.
30176	58	11	22	Bi feith Joseph dyynge hadde mynde of the passyng forth of the children of Israel, and comaundide of hise boonys.
30177	58	11	23	Bi feith Moyses borun, was hid thre monethis of his fadir and modir, for that thei seiyen the yonge child fair; and thei dredden not the maundement of the king.
30178	58	11	24	Bi feith Moises was maad greet, and denyede that he was the sone of Faraos douytir,
30179	58	11	25	and chees more to be turmentid with the puple of God, than to haue myrthe of temporal synne;
30180	58	11	26	demynge the repreef of Crist more richessis than the tresours of Egipcians; for he bihelde in to the rewarding.
30181	58	11	27	Bi feith he forsook Egipt, and dredde not the hardynesse of the king; for he abood, as seinge hym that was vnuysible.
30182	58	11	28	Bi feith he halewide pask, and the scheding out of blood, that he that distriede the firste thingis of Egipcians, schulde not touche hem.
30183	58	11	29	Bi feith thei passiden the reed see, as bi drye lond, which thing Egipcians asaiynge weren deuourid.
30184	58	11	30	Bi feith the wallis of Jerico felden doun, bi cumpassyng of seuene daies.
30185	58	11	31	Bi feith Raab hoor resseyuede the aspieris with pees, and perischide not with vnbileueful men.
30186	58	11	32	And what yit schal Y seie? For tyme schal faile to me tellynge of Gedeon, Barak, Sampson, Jepte, Dauid, and Samuel, and of othere prophetis;
30187	58	11	33	whiche bi feith ouercamen rewmes, wrouyten riytwisnesse, gaten repromyssiouns; thei stoppiden the mouthis of liouns,
30188	58	11	34	thei quenchiden the feersnesse of fier, thei dryueden awei the egge of swerd, thei coueriden of sijknesse, thei weren maad strong in batel, thei turneden the oostis of aliens.
30189	58	11	35	Wymmen resseyueden her deed children fro deth to lijf; but othere weren holdun forth, not takinge redempcioun, that thei schulden fynde a betere ayenrising.
30190	58	11	36	And othere asaieden scornyngis and betingis, more ouer and boondis and prisouns.
30191	58	11	37	Thei weren stoned, thei weren sawid, thei weren temptid, thei weren deed in sleyng of swerd. Thei wenten aboute in broc skynnes, and in skynnes of geet, nedi, angwischid, turmentid;
30192	58	11	38	to whiche the world was not worthi. Thei erriden in wildernessis, in mounteynes and dennes, and caues of the erthe.
30193	58	11	39	And alle these, preued bi witnessing of feith, token not repromyssioun;
30194	58	11	40	for God purueiede sum betere thing for vs, that thei schulden not be maad perfit with outen vs.
30195	58	12	1	Therfor we that han so greet a cloude of witnessis put to, do we awei al charge, and synne stondinge aboute vs, and bi pacience renne we to the batel purposid to vs,
30196	58	12	2	biholdinge in to the makere of feith, and the perfit endere, Jhesu; which whanne ioye was purposid to hym, he suffride the cros, and dispiside confusioun, and sittith on the riythalf of the seet of God.
30197	58	12	3	And bithenke ye on hym that suffride siche `ayen seiynge of synful men ayens hym silf, that ye be not maad wery, failinge in youre soulis.
30198	58	12	4	For ye ayenstoden not yit `til to blood, fiytyng ayens synne.
30199	58	12	5	And ye han foryet the coumfort that spekith to you as to sones, and seith, My sone, nyle thou dispise the teching of the Lord, nether be thou maad weri, the while thou art chastisid of hym.
30200	58	12	6	For the Lord chastisith hym that he loueth; he betith euery sone that he resseyueth.
30201	58	12	7	Abide ye stille in chastising; God proferith hym to you as to sones. For what sone is it, whom the fadir chastisith not?
30202	58	12	8	That if ye `ben out of chastising, whos parteneris ben ye alle maad, thanne ye ben auowtreris, and not sones.
30203	58	12	9	And aftirward we hadden fadris of oure fleisch, techeris, and we with reuerence dredden hem. Whethir not myche more we schulen obeische to the fadir of spiritis, and we schulen lyue?
30204	58	12	10	And thei in tyme of fewe dayes tauyten vs bi her wille; but this fadir techith to that thing that is profitable, in resseyuynge the halewing of hym.
30205	58	12	11	And ech chastisyng in present tyme semeth to be not of ioye, but of sorewe; but aftirward it schal yelde fruyt of riytwisnesse moost pesible to men exercisid bi it.
30206	58	12	12	For whiche thing reise ye slowe hondis,
30207	58	12	13	and knees vnboundun, and make ye riytful steppis to youre feet; that no man haltinge erre, but more be heelid.
30208	58	12	14	Sue ye pees with alle men, and holynesse, with out which no man schal se God.
30209	58	12	15	Biholde ye, that no man faile to the grace of God, that no roote of bittirnesse buriownynge vpward lette, and manye ben defoulid bi it;
30210	58	12	16	that no man be letchour, ether vnhooli, as Esau, which for o mete seelde hise firste thingis.
30211	58	12	17	For wite ye, that afterward he coueitinge to enherite blessing, was repreued. For he foond not place of penaunce, thouy he souyte it with teeris.
30212	58	12	18	But ye han not come to the fier able to be touchid, and able to come to, and to the whirlewynd, and myst, and tempest, and soun of trumpe, and vois of wordis;
30213	58	12	19	which thei that herden, excusiden hem, that the word schulde not be maad to hem.
30214	58	12	20	For thei beren not that that was seid, And if a beeste touchide the hil, it was stonyd.
30215	58	12	21	And so dredeful it was that was seyn, that Moises seide, Y am a ferd, and ful of trembling.
30216	58	12	22	But ye han come nyy to the hil Sion, and to the cite of God lyuynge, the heuenli Jerusalem, and to the multitude of many thousynde aungels,
30217	58	12	23	and to the chirche of the firste men, whiche ben writun in heuenes, and to God, domesman of alle, and to the spirit of iust perfit men,
30218	58	12	24	and to Jhesu, mediatour of the newe testament, and to the sprenging of blood, `betere spekinge than Abel.
30219	58	12	25	Se ye, that ye forsake not the spekere; for if thei that forsaken him that spak on the erthe, aschapide not, myche more we that turnen awei fro him that spekith to vs fro heuenes.
30220	58	12	26	Whos vois than mouyde the erthe, but now he ayen bihetith, and seith, Yit onys and Y schal moue not oneli erthe, but also heuene.
30221	58	12	27	And that he seith, Yit onys, he declarith the translacioun of mouable thingis, as of maad thingis, that tho thingis dwelle, that ben vnmouable.
30222	58	12	28	Therfor we resseyuynge the kingdom vnmouable, haue we grace, bi which serue we plesynge to God with drede and reuerence.
30223	58	12	29	For oure God is fier that wastith.
30224	58	13	1	The charite of britherhod dwelle in you, and nyle ye foryete hospitalite;
30225	58	13	2	for bi this summen plesiden to aungels, that weren resseyued to herborewe.
30226	58	13	3	Thenke ye on boundun men, as ye weren togidere boundun, and of trauelinge men, as ye silf dwellinge in the body.
30227	58	13	4	`Wedding is in alle thingis onourable, and bed vnwemmed; for God schal deme fornicatouris and auouteris.
30228	58	13	5	Be youre maneres withoute coueitise, apaied with present thingis; for he seide, Y schal not leeue thee,
30229	58	13	6	nether forsake, so that we seie tristily, The Lord is an helpere to me; Y schal not drede, what a man schal do to me.
30230	58	13	7	Haue ye mynde of youre souereyns, that han spokun to you the word of God; of whiche `biholde ye the goyng out of lyuynge, and sue ye the feith of hem,
30231	58	13	8	Jhesu Crist, yistirdai, and to dai, he is also into worldis.
30232	58	13	9	Nyle ye be led awei with dyuerse `techingis, and straunge. For it is best to stable the herte with grace, not with metis, whiche profitiden not to men wandringe in hem.
30233	58	13	10	We han an auter, of which thei that seruen to the tabernacle, han not power to ete.
30234	58	13	11	For of whiche beestis the blood is borun in for synne in to hooli thingis bi the bischop, the bodies of hem ben brent with out the castels.
30235	58	13	12	For which thing Jhesu, that he schulde halewe the puple bi his blood, suffride with out the gate.
30236	58	13	13	Therfor go we out to hym with out the castels, berynge his repreef.
30237	58	13	14	For we han not here a citee dwellynge, but we seken a citee to comynge.
30238	58	13	15	Therfor bi hym offre we a sacrifice of heriyng euere more to God, that is to seye, the fruyt of lippis knoulechinge to his name.
30239	58	13	16	And nyle ye foryete wel doynge, and comynyng; for bi siche sacrifices God is disserued.
30240	58	13	17	Obeie ye to youre souereyns, and be ye suget to hem; for thei perfitli waken, as to yeldinge resoun for youre soulis, that thei do this thing with ioie, and not sorewinge; for this thing spedith not to you.
30241	58	13	18	Preie ye for vs, and we tristen that we han good conscience in alle thingis, willynge to lyue wel.
30242	58	13	19	More ouer Y biseche you to do, that Y be restorid the sunnere to you.
30243	58	13	20	And God of pees, that ladde out fro deth the greet scheepherd of scheep, in the blood of euerlastinge testament, oure Lord Jhesu Crist,
30244	58	13	21	schape you in al good thing, that ye do the wille of hym; and he do in you that thing that schal plese bifor hym, bi Jhesu Crist, to whom be glorie in to worldis of worldis. Amen.
30245	58	13	22	And, britheren, Y preie you, that ye suffre a word of solace; for bi ful fewe thingis Y haue writun to you.
30246	58	13	23	Knowe ye oure brother Tymothe, that is sent forth, with whom if he schal come more hastili, Y schal se you.
30247	58	13	24	Grete ye wel alle youre souereyns, and alle hooli men. The britheren of Italie greten you wel.
30248	58	13	25	The grace of God be with you alle. Amen.
30249	59	1	1	James, the seruaunt of God, and of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, to the twelue kinredis, that ben in scatering abrood, helthe.
30250	59	1	2	My britheren, deme ye al ioye, whanne ye fallen in to diuerse temptaciouns, witynge,
30251	59	1	3	that the preuyng of youre feith worchith pacience;
30252	59	1	4	and pacience hath a perfit werk, that ye be perfit and hole, and faile in no thing.
30253	59	1	5	And if ony of you nedith wisdom, axe he of God, which yyueth to alle men largeli, and vpbreidith not; and it schal be youun to hym.
30254	59	1	6	But axe he in feith, and doute no thing; for he that doutith, is lijk to a wawe of the see, which is moued and borun a boute of wynde.
30255	59	1	7	Therfor gesse not the ilke man, that he schal take ony thing of the Lord.
30256	59	1	8	A man dowble in soule is vnstable in alle hise weies.
30257	59	1	9	And a meke brother haue glorie in his enhaunsyng,
30258	59	1	10	and a riche man in his lownesse; for as the flour of gras he schal passe.
30259	59	1	11	The sunne roos vp with heete, and driede the gras, and the flour of it felde doun, and the fairnesse of his chere perischide; and so a riche man welewith in hise weies.
30260	59	1	12	Blessid is the man, that suffrith temptacioun; for whanne he schal be preued, he schal resseyue the coroun of lijf, which God biheyte to men that louen hym.
30261	59	1	13	No man whanne he is temptid, seie, that he is temptid of God; for whi God is not a temptere of yuele thingis, for he temptith no man.
30262	59	1	14	But ech man is temptid, drawun and stirid of his owne coueiting.
30263	59	1	15	Aftirward coueityng, whanne it hath conseyued, bringith forth synne; but synne, whanne it is fillid, gendrith deth.
30264	59	1	16	Therfor, my most dereworthe britheren, nyle ye erre.
30265	59	1	17	Ech good yifte, and ech perfit yifte is from aboue, and cometh doun fro the fadir of liytis, anentis whom is noon other chaungyng, ne ouerschadewyng of reward.
30266	59	1	18	For wilfulli he bigat vs bi the word of treuthe, that we be a bigynnyng of his creature.
30267	59	1	19	Wite ye, my britheren moost loued, be ech man swift to here, but slow to speke, and slow to wraththe;
30268	59	1	20	for the wraththe of man worchith not the riytwisnesse of God.
30269	59	1	21	For which thing caste ye awei al vnclennesse, and plentee of malice, and in myldenesse resseyue ye the word that is plauntid, that may saue youre soulis.
30270	59	1	22	But be ye doeris of the word, and not hereris oneli, disseiuynge you silf.
30271	59	1	23	For if ony man is an herere of the word, and not a doere, this schal be licned to a man that biholdith the cheer of his birthe in a mirour;
30272	59	1	24	for he bihelde hym silf, and wente awei, and anoon he foryat which he was.
30273	59	1	25	But he that biholdith in the lawe of perfit fredom, and dwellith in it, and is not maad a foryetful herere, but a doere of werk, this schal be blessid in his dede.
30274	59	1	26	And if ony man gessith hym silf to be religiouse, and refreyneth not his tunge, but disseyueth his herte, the religioun of him is veyn.
30275	59	1	27	A clene religioun, and an vnwemmed anentis God and the fadir, is this, to visite fadirles and modirles children, and widewis in her tribulacioun, and to kepe hym silf vndefoulid fro this world.
30276	59	2	1	Mi britheren, nyle ye haue the feith of oure Lord Jhesu Crist of glorie, in accepcioun of persoones.
30277	59	2	2	For if a man `that hath a goldun ring, and in a feire clothing, cometh in youre cumpany, and a pore man entrith in a foul clothing,
30278	59	2	3	and if ye biholden in to hym that is clothid with clere clothing, and if ye seie to hym, Sitte thou here wel; but to the pore man ye seien, Stonde thou there, ethir sitte vndur the stool of my feet; whether ye demen not anentis you silf,
30279	59	2	4	and ben maad domesmen of wickid thouytis?
30280	59	2	5	Heere ye, my moost dereworthe britheren, whethir God chees not pore men in this world, riche in feith, and eiris of the kyngdom, that God bihiyte to men that louen him?
30281	59	2	6	But ye han dispisid the pore man. Whether riche men oppressen not you bi power, and thei drawen you to domes?
30282	59	2	7	Whether thei blasfemen not the good name, that is clepid to help on you?
30283	59	2	8	Netheles if ye performen the kingis lawe, bi scripturis, Thou schalt loue thi neiybour as thi silf, ye don wel.
30284	59	2	9	But if ye taken persones, ye worchen synne, and ben repreued of the lawe, as trespasseris.
30285	59	2	10	And who euere kepith al the lawe, but offendith in oon, he is maad gilti of alle.
30286	59	2	11	For he that seide, Thou schalt do no letcherie, seide also, Thou schalt not sle; that if thou doist not letcherie, but thou sleest, thou art maad trespassour of the lawe.
30287	59	2	12	Thus speke ye, and thus do ye, as bigynnynge to be demyd bi the lawe of fredom.
30288	59	2	13	For whi dom with out merci is to hym, that doith no mercy; but merci aboue reisith dom.
30289	59	2	14	Mi britheren, what schal it profite, if ony man seie that he hath feith, but he hath not the werkis? whether feith schal mowe saue hym?
30290	59	2	15	And if a brother ethir sister be nakid, and han nede of ech daies lyuelode,
30291	59	2	16	and if ony of you seie to hem, Go ye in pees, be ye maad hoot, and be ye fillid; but if ye yyuen not to hem tho thingis that ben necessarie to bodi, what schal it profite?
30292	59	2	17	So also feith, if it hath not werkis, is deed in it silf.
30293	59	2	18	But summan schal seie, Thou hast feith, and Y haue werkis; schewe thou to me thi feith with out werkis, and Y schal schewe to thee my feith of werkis.
30294	59	2	19	Thou bileuest, that o God is; thou doist wel; and deuelis bileuen, and tremblen.
30295	59	2	20	But wolt thou wite, thou veyn man, that feith with out werkis is idul?
30296	59	2	21	Whether Abraham, oure fadir, was not iustified of werkis, offringe Ysaac, his sone, on the auter?
30297	59	2	22	Therfor thou seest, that feith wrouyte with hise werkis, and his feith was fillid of werkis.
30298	59	2	23	And the scripture was fillid, seiynge, Abraham bileuede to God, and it was arettid to hym to riytwisnesse, and he was clepid the freend of God.
30299	59	2	24	Ye seen that a man is iustified of werkis, and not of feith oneli.
30300	59	2	25	In lijk maner, and whether also Raab, the hoore, was not iustified of werkis, and resseyuede the messangeris, and sente hem out bi anothir weie?
30301	59	2	26	For as the bodi with out spirit is deed, so also feith with out werkis is deed.
30302	59	3	1	Mi britheren, nyle ye be maad many maistris, witynge that ye taken the more doom.
30303	59	3	2	For alle we offenden in many thingis. If ony man offendith not in word, this is a perfit man; for also he may lede aboute al the bodi with a bridil.
30304	59	3	3	For if we putten bridlis `in to horsis mouthis, for to consente to vs, and we leden aboute al the bodi of hem.
30305	59	3	4	And lo! schippis, whanne thei ben grete, and ben dryuun of stronge wyndis, yit thei ben borun about of a litil gouernaile, where the meuyng of the gouernour wole.
30306	59	3	5	So also the tunge is but a litil membre, and reisith grete thingis. Lo! hou litil fier brenneth a ful greet wode.
30307	59	3	6	And oure tunge is fier, the vniuersite of wickidnesse. The tunge is ordeyned in oure membris, which defoulith al the bodi; and it is enflawmed of helle, and enflawmeth the wheel of oure birthe.
30308	59	3	7	And al the kynde of beestis, and of foulis, and of serpentis, and of othere is chastisid, and tho ben maad tame of mannus kinde; but no man mai chastise the tunge,
30309	59	3	8	for it is an vnpesible yuel, and ful of deedli venym.
30310	59	3	9	In it we blessen God, the fadir, and in it we cursen men, that ben maad to the licnesse of God.
30311	59	3	10	Of the same mouth passith forth blessing and cursing. My britheren, it bihoueth not that these thingis be don so.
30312	59	3	11	Whether a welle of the same hoole bringith forth swete and salt watir?
30313	59	3	12	My britheren, whether a fige tre may make grapis, ethir a vyne figus? So nethir salt watir mai make swete watir.
30314	59	3	13	Who is wijs, and tauyt among you? schewe he of good lyuyng his worching, in myldenesse of his wisdom.
30315	59	3	14	That if ye han bitter enuye, and stryuyngis ben in youre hertis, nyle ye haue glorye, and be lyeris ayens the treuthe.
30316	59	3	15	For this wisdom is not fro aboue comynge doun, but ertheli, and beestli, and feendli.
30317	59	3	16	For where is enuye and strijf, there is vnstidfastnesse and al schrewid werk.
30318	59	3	17	But wisdom that is from aboue, first it is chast, aftirward pesible, mylde, able to be counseilid, consentinge to goode thingis, ful of merci and of goode fruytis, demynge with out feynyng.

30322	59	4	3	Ye axen, and ye resseyuen not; for that ye axen yuele, as ye schewen opynli in youre coueitisis.
30323	59	4	4	Auowtreris, witen not ye, that the frenschip of this world is enemye to God? Therfor who euere wole be frend of this world, is maad the enemye of God.
30324	59	4	5	Whether ye gessen, that the scripture seith veynli, The spirit that dwellith in you, coueitith to enuye?
30325	59	4	6	But he yyueth the more grace; for which thing he seith, God withstondith proude men, but to meke men he yyueth grace.
30326	59	4	7	Therfor be ye suget to God; but withstonde ye the deuel, and he schal fle fro you.
30327	59	4	8	Neiye ye to God, and he schal neiye to you. Ye synneris, clense ye hondis, and ye double in soule, purge ye the hertis.
30328	59	4	9	Be ye wretchis, and weile ye; youre leiyyng be turned in to weping, and ioye in to sorewe of herte.

30330	59	4	11	My britheren, nyle ye bacbite ech othere. He that bacbitith his brothir, ethir that demeth his brothir, bacbitith the lawe, and demeth the lawe. And if thou demest the lawe, thou art not a doere of the lawe, but a domesman.

30381	60	1	25	but the word of the Lord dwellith with outen ende. And this is the word, that is prechid to you.
30382	60	2	1	Therfor putte ye awei al malice, and al gile, and feynyngis, and enuyes, and alle bacbityngis;

30388	60	2	7	Therfor onour to you that bileuen; but to men that bileuen not, the stoon whom the bilderis repreuyden, this is maad in to the heed of the corner; and the stoon of hirtyng,
30389	60	2	8	and stoon of sclaundre, to hem that offenden to the word, nethir bileuen it, in which thei ben set.

30394	60	2	13	Be ye suget to ech creature, for God; ethir to the kyng, as to hym that is hiyer in state,
30395	60	2	14	ethir to duykis, as to thilke that ben sent of hym to the veniaunce of mysdoers, and to the preisyng of good men.
30396	60	2	15	For so is the wille of God, that ye do wel, and make the vnkunnyngnesse of vnprudent men to be doumb.
30397	60	2	16	As fre men, and not as hauynge fredom the keuering of malice, but as the seruauntis of God.
30398	60	2	17	Onoure ye alle men, loue ye brithirhod, drede ye God, onoure ye the king.
30399	60	2	18	Seruauntis, be ye sugetis in al drede to lordis, not oneli to good and to mylde, but also to tyrauntis.
30400	60	2	19	For this is grace, if for conscience of God ony man suffrith heuynessis, and suffrith vniustli.
30401	60	2	20	For what grace is it, if ye synnen, and ben buffatid, and suffren? But if ye don wel, and suffren pacientli, this is grace anentis God.
30402	60	2	21	For to this thing ye ben clepid. For also Crist suffride for vs, and lefte ensaumple to you, that ye folewe the steppis of hym.
30403	60	2	22	Which dide not synne, nethir gile was foundun in his mouth.
30404	60	2	23	And whanne he was cursid, he curside not; whanne he suffride, he manasside not; but he bitook hym silf to hym, that demyde hym vniustli.
30405	60	2	24	And he hym silf bar oure synnes in his bodi on a tre, that we be deed to synnes, and lyue to riytwisnesse, bi whos wan wounde ye ben heelid.
30406	60	2	25	For ye weren as scheep errynge, but ye ben now turned to the schipherde, and bischop of youre soulis.
30407	60	3	1	Also wymmen be thei suget to her hosebondis; that if ony man bileue not to the word, bi the conuersacioun of wymmen thei be wonnun with out word.
30408	60	3	2	And biholde ye in drede youre hooli conuersacioun.
30409	60	3	3	Of whiche `ther be not with outforth curious ournyng of heer, ether doyng aboute of gold, ethir ournyng of clothing;
30410	60	3	4	but thilke that is the hid man of herte, in vncorrupcioun, and of mylde spirit, which is riche in the siyt of God.
30411	60	3	5	For so sumtyme hooli wymmen hopinge in God ourneden hem silf, and weren suget to her owne hosebondis.
30412	60	3	6	As Sara obeied to Abraham, and clepide hym lord; of whom ye ben douytris wel doynge, and not dredynge ony perturbacioun.
30413	60	3	7	Also men dwelle togidre, and bi kunnyng yyue ye onoure to the wommanus freeltee, as to the more feble, and as to euen eiris of grace and of lijf, that youre preieris be not lettid.
30414	60	3	8	And in feith alle of oon wille in preier be ye eche suffringe with othere, loueris of britherhod, merciful, mylde, meke;
30415	60	3	9	not yeldinge yuel for yuel, nether cursing for cursing, but ayenward blessinge; for in this thing ye ben clepid, that ye welde blessinge bi eritage.
30416	60	3	10	For he that wole loue lijf, and se goode daies, constreyne his tunge from yuel, and hise lippis, that thei speke not gile.
30417	60	3	11	And bowe he from yuel, and do good; seke he pees, and perfitli sue it.
30418	60	3	12	For the iyen of the Lord ben on iust men, and hise eris on the preieris of hem; but the cheer of the Lord is on men that don yuels.
30419	60	3	13	And who is it that schal anoye you, if ye ben sueris and louyeris of goodnesse?
30420	60	3	14	But also if ye suffren ony thing for riytwisnesse, ye ben blessid; but drede ye not the drede of hem, that ye be not disturblid.
30421	60	3	15	But halewe ye the Lord Crist in youre hertis, and euermore be ye redi to satisfaccioun to ech man axynge you resoun of that feith and hope that is in you,
30422	60	3	16	but with myldenesse and drede, hauynge good conscience; that in that thing that thei bacbiten of you, thei ben confoundid, whiche chalengen falsly youre good conuersacioun in Crist.
30423	60	3	17	For it is betere that ye do wel, and suffre, if the wille of God wole, than doynge yuele.
30424	60	3	18	For also Crist onys diede for oure synnes, he iust for vniust, that he schulde offre to God vs, maad deed in fleisch, but maad quik in spirit.
30425	60	3	19	For which thing he cam in spirit, and also to hem that weren closid togidre in prisoun prechide;
30426	60	3	20	whiche weren sum tyme vnbileueful, whanne thei abididen the pacience of God in the daies of Noe, whanne the schip was maad, in which a few, that is to seie, eiyte soulis weren maad saaf bi water.
30427	60	3	21	And so baptym of lijk forme makith vs saaf; not the puttyng awei of the filthis of fleisch, but the axyng of a good conscience in God, bi the ayenrysyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, that is in the riyt half of God,
30428	60	3	22	and swolewith deth, that we schulden be made eiris of euerlastinge lijf. He yede in to heuene, and aungelis, and powers, and vertues, ben maad sugetis to hym.
30429	60	4	1	Therfor for Crist suffride in fleisch, be ye also armed bi the same thenkynge; for he that suffride in fleisch ceesside fro synnes,
30430	60	4	2	that that is left now in fleisch lyue not now to the desiris of men, but to the wille of God.
30431	60	4	3	For the time that is passid is ynow to the wille of hethene men to be endid, whiche walkiden in letcheries, and lustis, in myche drinking of wyn, in vnmesurable etyngis, and drynkyngis, and vnleueful worschiping of mawmetis.
30432	60	4	4	In whiche now thei ben astonyed, in which thing thei wondren, for ye rennen not togidere `in to the same confusioun of letcherie, and blasfemen.
30433	60	4	5	And thei schulen yyue resoun to hym, that is redi to deme the quyke and the deed.
30434	60	4	6	For whi for this thing it is prechid also to deed men, that thei be demed bi men in fleisch, and that thei lyue bi God in spirit.
30435	60	4	7	For the ende of alle thingis schal neiye. Therfor be ye prudent, and wake ye in preyeris;
30436	60	4	8	bifore alle thingis haue ye charite ech to other in you silf algatis lastynge; for charite couerith the multitude of synnes.
30437	60	4	9	Holde ye hospitalite togidere with out grutching;
30438	60	4	10	ech man as he hath resseyued grace, mynystringe it in to ech othere, as good dispenderis of the manyfold grace of God.
30439	60	4	11	If ony man spekith, speke he as the wordis of God; if ony man mynystrith, as of the vertu which God mynystrith; that God be onourid in alle thingis bi Jhesu Crist oure Lord, to whom is glorie and lordschip in to worldis `of worldis.
30440	60	4	12	Amen. Moost dere brytheren, nyle ye go in pilgrymage in feruour, that is maad to you to temptacioun, as if ony newe thing bifalle to you;
30441	60	4	13	but comyne ye with the passiouns of Crist, and haue ye ioye, that also ye be glad, and haue ioye in the reuelacioun of his glorie.
30442	60	4	14	If ye ben dispisid for the name of Crist, ye schulen be blessid; for that that is of the onour, and of the glorie, and of the vertu of God, and the spirit that is his, schal reste on you.
30443	60	4	15	But no man of you suffre as a mansleere, ethir a theef, ether cursere, ethir a disirere of othere mennus goodis;
30444	60	4	16	but if as a cristen man, schame he not, but glorifie he God in this name.
30445	60	4	17	For tyme is, that doom bigynne at Goddis hous; and if it bigynne first at vs, what ende schal be of hem, that bileuen not to the gospel?
30446	60	4	18	And if a iust man vnnethe schal be sauid, where schulen the vnfeithful man and the synnere appere? Therfor and thei that suffren bi the wille of God, bitaken her soulis in good dedis to the feithful makere of nouyt.
30447	60	5	1	Therfor Y, an euene eldre man, and a witnesse of Cristis passiouns, which also am a comynere of that glorie, that schal be schewid in tyme to comynge; byseche ye the eldre men,
30448	60	5	2	that ben among you, fede ye the flok of God, that is among you, and puruey ye, not as constreyned, but wilfulli, bi God; not for loue of foule wynnyng,
30449	60	5	3	but wilfulli, nether as hauynge lordschip in the clergie, but that ye ben maad ensaumple of the floc, of wille.
30450	60	5	4	And whanne the prince of scheepherdis schal appere, ye schulen resseyue the coroun of glorie, that may neuere fade.
30451	60	5	5	Also, ye yonge men, be ye suget to eldre men, and alle schewe ye togidere mekenesse; for the Lord withstondith proude men, but he yyueth grace to meke men.
30452	60	5	6	Therfor be ye mekid vndir the myyti hoond of God, that he reise you in the tyme of visitacioun,
30453	60	5	7	and caste ye al youre bisynesse in to hym, for to hym is cure of you.
30454	60	5	8	Be ye sobre, and wake ye, for youre aduersarie, the deuel, as a rorynge lioun goith aboute, sechinge whom he schal deuoure.
30455	60	5	9	Whom ayenstonde ye, stronge in the feith, witynge that the same passioun is maad to thilke brithirhode of you, that is in the world.
30456	60	5	10	And God of al grace, that clepide you in to his euerlastinge glorie, you suffrynge a litil, he schal performe, and schal conferme, and schal make sad.
30457	60	5	11	To hym be glorie and lordschip, in to worldis of worldis. Amen.
30458	60	5	12	Bi Siluan, feithful brother to you as Y deme, Y wroot schortli; bisechinge, and witnessinge that this is the very grace of God, in which ye stonden.
30459	60	5	13	The chirche that is gaderid in Babiloyne, and Marcus, my sone, gretith you wel.
30460	60	5	14	Grete ye wel togidere in hooli cos. Grace be to you alle that ben in Crist. Amen.
30461	61	1	1	Simount Petre, seruaunt and apostle of `Jhesu Crist, to hem that han take with vs the euene feith, in the riytwisnesse of oure God and sauyour Jhesu Crist,
30462	61	1	2	grace and pees be fillid to you, bi the knowing of oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
30463	61	1	3	Hou alle thingis of his godlich vertu, that ben to lijf and pitee, ben youun to vs, bi the knowyng of hym, that clepide vs for his owne glorie and vertu.
30464	61	1	4	Bi whom he yaf to vs moost preciouse biheestis; that bi these thingis ye schulen be maad felows of Goddis kynde, and fle the corrupcioun of that coueytise, that is in the world.
30465	61	1	5	And bringe ye in alle bisynesse, and mynystre ye in youre feith vertu, and `in vertu kunnyng;
30466	61	1	6	in kunnyng abstinence, in abstynence pacience, in pacience pitee;
30467	61	1	7	in pitee, love of britherhod, and in loue of britherhod charite.
30468	61	1	8	For if these ben with you, and ouercomen, thei schulen not make you voide, nethir with out fruyt, in the knowyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
30469	61	1	9	But to whom these ben not redi, he is blynd, and gropith with his hoond, and foryetith the purgyng of his elde trespassis.
30470	61	1	10	Wherfor, britheren, be ye more bisi, that by goode werkis ye make youre clepyng and chesyng certeyn;
30471	61	1	11	for ye doynge these thingis schulen not do synne ony tyme. For thus the entryng in to euerlastynge kyngdom of oure Lord and sauyour Jhesu Crist, schal be mynystrid to you plenteuousli.
30472	61	1	12	For which thing Y schal bigynne to moneste you euere more of these thingis; and Y wole that ye be kunnynge, and confermyd in this present treuthe.
30473	61	1	13	Forsothe Y deme iustli, as long as Y am in this tabernacle, to reise you in monesting; and Y am certeyn,
30474	61	1	14	that the putting awei of my tabernacle is swift, bi this that oure Lord Jhesu Crist hath schewid to me.
30475	61	1	15	But Y schal yyue bisynesse, and ofte after my deth ye haue mynde of these thingis.
30476	61	1	16	For we not suynge vnwise talis, han maad knowun to you the vertu and the biforknowyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist; but we weren maad biholderis of his greetnesse.
30477	61	1	17	For he took of God the fadir onour and glorie, bi siche maner vois slidun doun to hym fro the greet glorie, This is my loued sone, in whom Y haue plesid to me; here ye hym.
30478	61	1	18	And we herden this vois brouyt from heuene, whanne we weren with hym in the hooli hil.
30479	61	1	19	And we han a saddere word of prophecie, to which ye yyuynge tent don wel, as to a lanterne that yyueth liyt in a derk place, til the dai bigynne to yyue liyt, and the dai sterre sprenge in youre hertis.
30480	61	1	20	And firste vndurstonde ye this thing, that ech prophesie of scripture is not maad bi propre interpretacioun;
30481	61	1	21	for prophesie was not brouyt ony tyme bi mannus wille, but the hooli men of God inspirid with the Hooli Goost spaken.
30482	61	2	1	But also false prophetis weren in the puple, as in you schulen be maistris lieris, that schulen bringe in sectis of perdicioun; and thei denyen thilke Lord that bouyte hem, and bringen on hem silf hasti perdicioun.
30483	61	2	2	And many schulen sue her letcheries, bi whiche the weie of treuthe schal be blasfemyd;
30484	61	2	3	and thei schulen make marchaundie of you in coueytise bi feyned wordis. To whiche doom now a while ago ceessith not, and the perdicioun of hem nappith not.
30485	61	2	4	For if God sparide not aungels synnynge, but bitook hem to be turmentid, and to be drawun doun with boondis of helle in to helle, to be kept in to dom;
30486	61	2	5	and sparide not the firste world, but kept Noe, the eiythe man, the biforgoere of riytwisnesse, and brouyte in the greet flood to the world of vnfeithful men;
30487	61	2	6	and he droof in to poudre the citees of men of Sodom and of men of Gommor, and dampnede bi turnyng vpsedoun, and putte hem the ensaumple of hem that weren to doynge yuele;
30488	61	2	7	and delyuerid the iust Loth, oppressid of the wrong, and of the letcherouse conuersacioun of cursid men;
30489	61	2	8	for in siyt and hering he was iust, and dwellide amongst hem that fro dai in to dai turmentiden with wickid werkis a iust soule.
30490	61	2	9	For the Lord kan delyuere piteuouse men fro temptacioun, and kepe wickid men `in to the dai of dom to be turmentid;
30491	61	2	10	but more hem that walken aftir the fleisch, in coueytinge of vnclennesse, and dispisen lordschiping, and ben boold, plesynge hem silf, and dreden not to bringe in sectis, blasfemynge; where aungels,
30492	61	2	11	whanne thei ben more in strengthe and vertu, beren not `that was the execrable doom ayens hem.
30493	61	2	12	But these ben as vnresonable beestis, kyndli in to takyng, and in to deth, blasfemynge in these thingis that thei knowen not, and schulen perische in her corrupcioun,
30494	61	2	13	and resseyue the hire of vnriytwisnesse. And thei gessen delicis of defouling and of wemme, to be likyngis of dai, flowynge in her feestis with delicis, doynge letcherie with you,
30495	61	2	14	and han iyen ful of auowtrie, and vnceessynge trespas, disseyuynge vnstidfast soulis, and han the herte excercisid to coueitise; the sones of cursyng,
30496	61	2	15	that forsaken the riyt weie, and erriden, suynge the weie of Balaam of Bosor, which louyde the hire of wickidnesse.
30497	61	2	16	But he hadde repreuyng of his woodnesse; a doumb beest vndur yok, that spak with vois of man, that forbede the vnwisdom of the profete.
30498	61	2	17	These ben wellis with out watir, and mystis dryuun with `whirlinge wyndys, to whiche the thicke mijst of derknessis is reseruyd.
30499	61	2	18	And thei speken in pryde of vanyte, and disseyuen in desiris of fleisch of letcherie hem, that scapen a litil.
30500	61	2	19	Whiche lyuen in errour, and biheten fredom to hem, whanne thei ben seruauntis of corrupcioun. For of whom ony man is ouercomun, of hym also he is seruaunt.
30501	61	2	20	For if men forsaken the vnclennessis of the world, bi the knowyng of oure Lord and sauyour Jhesu Crist, and eftsone ben wlappid in these, and ben ouercomun, the lattere thingis ben maad to hem worse than the formere.
30502	61	2	21	For it was betere to hem to not knowe the weie of riytwisnesse, than to turne ayen aftir the knowyng, fro that hooli maundement that was bitakun to hem.
30503	61	2	22	For thilke very prouerb bifelde to hem, The hound turnede ayen to his castyng, and a sowe is waischun in walwyng in fenne.
30504	61	3	1	Lo! ye moost dereworth britheren, Y write to you this secounde epistle, in which Y stire youre clere soule bi monesting togidere,
30505	61	3	2	that ye be myndeful of tho wordis, that Y biforseide of the hooli prophetis, and of the maundementis of the hooli apostlis of the Lord and sauyour.
30506	61	3	3	First wite ye this thing, that in the laste daies disseyueris schulen come in disseit, goynge aftir her owne coueityngis,
30507	61	3	4	seiynge, Where is the biheest, or the comyng of hym? for sithen the fadris dieden, alle thingis lasten fro the bigynnyng of creature.
30508	61	3	5	But it is hid fro hem willynge this thing, that heuenes were bifore, and the erthe of water was stondynge bi watir, of Goddis word;
30509	61	3	6	bi which that ilke world clensid, thanne bi watir perischide.
30510	61	3	7	But the heuenes that now ben, and the erthe, ben kept bi the same word, and ben reseruyd to fier in to the dai of doom and perdicioun of wickid men.
30511	61	3	8	But, ye moost dere, this o thing be not hid to you, that o dai anentis God is as a thousynde yeeris, and a thousynde yeeris ben as o dai.
30512	61	3	9	The Lord tarieth not his biheest, as summe gessen, but he doith pacientli for you, and wole not that ony men perische, but that alle turne ayen to penaunce.
30513	61	3	10	For the dai of the Lord schal come as a theef, in which heuenes with greet bire schulen passe, and elementis schulen be dissoluyd bi heete, and the erthe, and alle the werkis that ben in it, schulen be brent.
30514	61	3	11	Therfor whanne alle these thingis schulen be dissolued, what manner men bihoueth it you to be in hooli lyuyngis and pitees,
30515	61	3	12	abidinge and hiyynge in to the comyng of the dai of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, bi whom heuenes brennynge schulen be dissoluyd, and elementis schulen faile bi brennyng of fier.
30516	61	3	13	Also we abiden bi hise biheestis newe heuenes and newe erthe, in which riytwisnesse dwellith.
30517	61	3	14	For which thing, ye moost dere, abidynge these thingis, be ye bisye to be foundun to hym in pees vnspottid and vndefoulid.
30518	61	3	15	And deme ye long abiding of oure Lord Jhesu Crist youre heelthe, as also oure moost dere brother Poul wroot to you, bi wisdom youun to hym.
30519	61	3	16	As and in alle epistlis he spekith `in hem of these thingis; in which ben summe hard thingis to vndurstonde, whiche vnwise and vnstable men deprauen, as also thei don othere scripturis, to her owne perdicioun.
30520	61	3	17	Therfor ye, britheren, bifor witynge kepe you silf, lest ye be disseyued bi errour of vnwise men, and falle awei fro youre owne sadnesse.
30521	61	3	18	But wexe ye in the grace and the knowyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist and oure Sauyour; to hym be glorie now and in to the dai of euerlastyngnesse. Amen.
30522	62	1	1	That thing that was fro the bigynnyng, which we herden, which we sayn with oure iyen, which we bihelden, and oure hondis touchiden, of the word of lijf; and the lijf is schewid.
30523	62	1	2	And we sayn, and we witnessen, and tellen to you the euerlastynge lijf, that was anentis the fadir, and apperide to vs.
30524	62	1	3	Therfor `we tellen to you that thing, that we seyn, and herden, that also ye haue felowschipe with vs, and oure felowschip be with the fadir, and with his sone Jhesu Crist.
30525	62	1	4	And we writen this thing to you, that ye haue ioye, and that youre ioye be ful.
30526	62	1	5	And this is the tellyng, that we herden of hym, and tellen to you, that God is liyt, and ther ben no derknessis in him.
30527	62	1	6	If we seien, that we han felawschip with hym, and we wandren in derknessis, we lien, and don not treuthe.
30528	62	1	7	But if we walken in liyt, as also he is in liyt, we han felawschip togidere; and the blood of Jhesu Crist, his sone, clensith vs fro al synne.
30529	62	1	8	If we seien, that we han no synne, we disseyuen vs silf, and treuthe is not in vs.
30530	62	1	9	If we knowlechen oure synnes, he is feithful and iust, that he foryyue to vs oure synnes, and clense vs from al wickidnesse.
30531	62	1	10	And if we seien, we han not synned, we maken hym a liere, and his word is not in vs.
30532	62	2	1	Mi litle sones, Y write to you these thingis, that ye synnen not. But if ony man synneth, we han an aduocat anentis the fadir,
30533	62	2	2	Jhesu Crist, and he is the foryyuenes for oure synnes; and not oneli for oure synnes, but also for the synnes of al the world.
30534	62	2	3	And in this thing we witen, that we knowen hym, if we kepen hise comaundementis.
30535	62	2	4	He that seith that he knowith God, and kepith not hise comaundementis, is a liere, and trewthe is not in hym.
30536	62	2	5	But the charite of God is perfit verili in hym, that kepith his word. In this thing we witen, that we ben in hym, if we ben perfit in hym.
30537	62	2	6	He that seith, that he dwellith in hym, he owith for to walke, as he walkide.
30538	62	2	7	Moost dere britheren, Y write to you, not a newe maundement, but the elde maundement, that ye hadden fro the bigynnyng. The elde maundement is the word, that ye herden.
30539	62	2	8	Eftsoone Y write to you a newe maundement, that is trewe bothe in hym and in you; for derknessis ben passid, and veri liyt schyneth now.
30540	62	2	9	He that seith, that he is in liyt, and hatith his brother, is in derknesse yit.
30541	62	2	10	He that loueth his brothir, dwellith in liyt, and sclaundre is not in hym.
30542	62	2	11	But he that hatith his brother, is in derknessis, and wandrith in derknessis, and woot not whidir he goith; for derknessis han blindid hise iyen.
30543	62	2	12	Litle sones, Y write to you, that youre synnes ben foryouun to you for his name.
30544	62	2	13	Fadris, Y write to you, for ye han knowun hym, that is fro the bigynnyng. Yonge men, Y write to you, for ye han ouercomun the wickid.
30545	62	2	14	Y write to you, yonge children, for ye han knowe the fadir. Y write to you, britheren, for ye han knowen hym, that is fro the bigynnyng. Y write to you, yonge men, for ye ben stronge, and the word of God dwellith in you, and ye han ouercomun the wickid.
30546	62	2	15	Nyle ye loue the world, ne tho thingis that ben in the world. If ony man loueth the world, the charite of the fader is not in hym.
30547	62	2	16	For al thing that is in the world, is coueitise of fleisch, and coueitise of iyen, and pride of lijf, which is not of the fadir, but it is of the world.
30548	62	2	17	And the world schal passe, and the coueitise of it; but he that doith the wille of God, dwellith with outen ende.
30549	62	2	18	My litle sones, the laste our is; and as ye han herd, that antecrist cometh, now many antecristis ben maad; wherfor we witen, that it is the laste our.
30550	62	2	19	Thei wenten forth fro vs, but thei weren not of vs; for if thei hadden be of vs, thei hadden dwelte with vs; but that thei be knowun, that thei ben not of vs.
30551	62	2	20	But ye han anointyng of the Hooli Goost, and knowen alle thingis.
30552	62	2	21	Y wroot not to you, as to men that knowen not treuthe, but as to men that knowen it, and for ech leesing is not of treuthe.
30553	62	2	22	Who is a liere, but this that denyeth that Jhesu is not Crist? This is antecrist, that denyeth the fadir, and the sone.
30554	62	2	23	So ech that denyeth the sone, hath not the fadir; but he that knowlechith the sone, hath also the fadir.
30555	62	2	24	That thing that ye herden at the bigynnyng, dwelle it in you; for if that thing dwellith in you, which ye herden at the bigynnyng, ye schulen dwelle in the sone and in the fadir.
30556	62	2	25	And this is the biheeste, that he bihiyte to vs euerlastinge lijf.
30557	62	2	26	Y wroot these thingis to you, of hem that disseyuen you,
30558	62	2	27	and that the anoyntyng which ye resseyueden of hym, dwelle in you. And ye han not nede, that ony man teche you, but as his anoyntyng techith you of alle thingis, and it is trewe, and it is not leesyng; and as he tauyte you, dwelle ye in hym.
30559	62	2	28	And now, ye litle sones, dwelle ye in hym, that whanne he schal appere, we haue a trist, and be not confoundid of hym in his comyng.
30560	62	2	29	If ye witen that he is iust, wite ye that also ech that doith riytwisnesse, is borun of hym.
30561	62	3	1	Se ye what maner charite the fadir yaf to vs, that we be named the sones of God, and ben hise sones. For this thing the world knewe not vs, for it knew not hym.
30562	62	3	2	Moost dere britheren, now we ben the sones of God, and yit it apperide not, what we schulen be. We witen, that whanne he schal appere, we schulen be lijk hym, for we schulen se hym as he is.
30563	62	3	3	And ech man that hath this hope in hym, makith hym silf hooli, as he is hooli.
30564	62	3	4	Ech man that doith synne, doith also wickidnesse, and synne is wickidnesse.
30565	62	3	5	And ye witen, that he apperide to do awei synnes, and synne is not in hym.
30566	62	3	6	Ech man that dwellith in hym, synneth not; and ech that synneth, seeth not hym, nether knew hym.
30567	62	3	7	Litle sones, no man disseyue you; he that doith riytwysnesse, is iust, as also he is iust.
30568	62	3	8	He that doith synne, is of the deuel; for the deuel synneth fro the bigynnyng. In this thing the sone of God apperide, that he vndo the werkis of the deuel.
30569	62	3	9	Ech man that is borun of God, doith not synne; for the seed of God dwellith in hym, and he may not do synne, for he is borun of God.
30570	62	3	10	In this thing the sones of God ben knowun, and the sones of the feend. Ech man that is not iust, is not of God, and he that loueth not his brothir.
30571	62	3	11	For this is the tellyng, that ye herden at the bigynnyng, that ye loue ech othere;
30572	62	3	12	not as Caym, that was of the yuele, and slouy his brother. And for what thing slouy he him? for hise werkis weren yuele, and hise brotheris iust.
30573	62	3	13	Britheren, nyle ye wondre, if the world hatith you.
30574	62	3	14	We witen, that we ben translatid fro deeth to lijf, for we louen britheren. He that loueth not, dwellith in deth.
30575	62	3	15	Ech man that hatith his brother, is a man sleere; and ye witen, that ech mansleere hath not euerlastinge lijf dwellinge in hym.
30576	62	3	16	In this thing we han knowe the charite of God, for he puttide his lijf for vs, and we owen to putte oure lyues for oure britheren.
30577	62	3	17	He that hath the catel of this world, and seeth that his brothir hath nede, and closith his entrailis fro hym, hou dwellith the charite of God in hym?
30578	62	3	18	Mi litle sones, loue we not in word, nethir in tunge, but in werk and treuthe.
30579	62	3	19	In this thing we knowen, that we ben of treuthe, and in his siyt we monesten oure hertis.
30580	62	3	20	For if oure herte repreueth vs, God is more than oure hert, and knowith alle thingis.
30581	62	3	21	Moost dere britheren, if oure herte repreueth not vs, we han trust to God;
30582	62	3	22	and what euer we schulen axe, we schulen resseyue of hym, for we kepen hise comaundementis, and we don tho thingis that ben plesaunt bifor hym.
30583	62	3	23	And this is the comaundement of God, that we bileue in the name of his sone Jhesu Crist, and that we loue ech othere, as he yaf heeste to vs.
30584	62	3	24	And he that kepith hise comaundementis, dwellith in hym, and he in hym. And in this thing we witen, that he dwellith in vs, bi the spirit, whom he yaf to vs.
30585	62	4	1	Moost dere britheren, nyle ye bileue to ech spirit, but preue ye spiritis, if thei ben of God; for many false prophetis wenten out in to the world.
30586	62	4	2	In this thing the spirit of God is knowun; ech spirit that knowlechith that Jhesu Crist hath come in fleisch, is of God;
30587	62	4	3	and ech spirit that fordoith Jhesu, is not of God. And this is antecrist, of whom ye herden, that he cometh; and riyt now he is in the world.
30588	62	4	4	Ye, litle sones, ben of God, and ye han ouercome hym; for he that is in you is more, than he that is in the world.
30589	62	4	5	Thei ben of the world, therfor thei speken of the world, and the world herith hem.
30590	62	4	6	We ben of God; he that knowith God, herith vs; he that is not of God, herith not vs. In this thing we knowen the spirit of treuthe, and the spirit of errour.
30591	62	4	7	Moost dere britheren, loue we togidere, for charite is of God; and ech that loueth his brother, is borun of God, and knowith God.
30592	62	4	8	He that loueth not, knowith not God; for God is charite.
30593	62	4	9	In this thing the charite of God apperide in vs, for God sente hise oon bigetun sone in to the world, that we lyue bi hym.
30594	62	4	10	In this thing is charite, not as we hadden loued God, but for he firste louede vs, and sente hise sone foryyuenesse for oure synnes.
30595	62	4	11	Ye moost dere britheren, if God louede vs, we owen to loue ech other.
30596	62	4	12	No man say euer God; if we louen togidre, God dwellith in vs, and the charite of hym is perfit in vs.
30597	62	4	13	In this thing we knowen, that we dwellen in hym, and he in vs; for of his spirit he yaf to vs.
30598	62	4	14	And we sayen, and witnessen, that the fadir sente his sone sauyour of the world.
30599	62	4	15	Who euer knowlechith, that Jhesu is the sone of God, God dwellith in him, and he in God.
30600	62	4	16	And we han knowun, and bileuen to the charite, that God hath in vs. God is charite, and he that dwellith in charite, dwellith in God, and God in hym.
30601	62	4	17	In this thing is the perfit charite of God with vs, that we haue trist in the dai of dom; for as he is, also we ben in this world.
30602	62	4	18	Drede is not in charite, but perfit charite puttith out drede; for drede hath peyne. But he that dredith, is not perfit in charite.
30603	62	4	19	Therfor loue we God, for he louede vs bifore.
30604	62	4	20	If ony man seith, that `Y loue God, and hatith his brother, he is a liere. For he that loueth not his brothir, which he seeth, hou mai he loue God, whom he seeth not?
30605	62	4	21	And we han this comaundement of God, that he that loueth God, loue also his brothir.
30606	62	5	1	Ech man that bileueth that Jhesus is Crist, is borun of God; and ech man that loueth hym that gendride, loueth hym that is borun of hym.
30607	62	5	2	In this thing we knowen, that we louen the children of God, whanne we louen God, and don his maundementis.
30608	62	5	3	For this is the charite of God, that we kepe hise maundementis; and his maundementis ben not heuy.
30609	62	5	4	For al thing that is borun of God, ouercometh the world; and this is the victorie that ouercometh the world, oure feith.
30610	62	5	5	And who is he that ouercometh the world, but he that bileueth that Jhesus is the sone of God?
30611	62	5	6	This is Jhesus Crist, that cam bi watir and blood; not in water oonli, but in watir and blood. And the spirit is he that witnessith, that Crist is treuthe.
30612	62	5	7	For thre ben, that yyuen witnessing in heuene, the Fadir, the Sone, and the Hooli Goost; and these thre ben oon.
30613	62	5	8	`And thre ben, that yyuen witnessing in erthe, the spirit, water, and blood; and these thre ben oon.
30614	62	5	9	If we resseyuen the witnessing of men, the witnessing of God is more; for this is the witnessing of God, that is more, for he witnesside of his sone.
30615	62	5	10	He that bileueth in the sone of God, hath the witnessing of God in hym. He that bileueth not to the sone, makith hym a liere; for he bileueth not in the witnessing, that God witnesside of his sone.
30616	62	5	11	And this is the witnessyng, for God yaf to you euerlastinge lijf, and this lijf is in his sone.
30617	62	5	12	He that hath the sone of God, hath also lijf; he that hath not the sone of God, hath not lijf.
30618	62	5	13	I write to you these thingis, that ye wite, that ye han euerlastynge lijf, which bileuen in the name of Goddis sone.
30619	62	5	14	And this is the trist which we han to God, that what euer thing we axen aftir his wille, he schal here vs.
30620	62	5	15	And we witen, that he herith vs, what euer thing we axen; we witen, that we han the axyngis, which we axen of hym.
30621	62	5	16	He that woot that his brother synneth a synne not to deth, axe he, and lijf schal be youun to hym that synneth not to deth. Ther is a synne to deth; `not for it Y seie, that ony man preie.
30622	62	5	17	Ech wickidnesse is synne, and ther is synne to deth.
30623	62	5	18	We witen, that ech man that is borun of God, synneth not; but the generacioun of God kepith hym, and the wickid touchith hym not.
30624	62	5	19	We witen, that we ben of God, and al the world is set in yuel.
30625	62	5	20	And we witen, that the sone of God cam in fleisch, and yaf to vs wit, that we know veri God, and be in the veri sone of hym.
30626	62	5	21	This is veri God, and euerlastynge lijf. My litle sones, kepe ye you fro maumetis.
30627	63	1	1	The eldere man, to the chosun ladi, and to her children, whiche Y loue in treuthe; and not Y aloone, but also alle men that knowen treuthe;
30628	63	1	2	for the treuthe that dwellith in you, and with you schal be with outen ende.
30629	63	1	3	Grace be with you, merci, and pees of God the fadir, and of Jhesu Crist, the sone of the fadir, in treuthe and charite.
30630	63	1	4	I ioiede ful myche, for Y foond of thi sones goynge in treuthe, as we resseyueden maundement of the fadir.
30631	63	1	5	And now Y preye thee, ladi, not as writinge a newe maundement to thee, but that that we hadden fro the bigynnyng, that we loue ech other.
30632	63	1	6	And this is charite, that we walke after his maundementis. For this is the comaundement, that as ye herden at the bigynnyng, walke ye in hym.
30633	63	1	7	For many disseyueris wenten out in to the world, which knoulechen not that Jhesu Crist hath come in fleisch; this is a disseyuere and antecrist.
30634	63	1	8	Se ye you silf, lest ye lesen the thingis that ye han wrouyt, that ye resseyue ful mede;
30635	63	1	9	witynge that ech man that goith bifore, and dwellith not in the teching of Crist, hath not God. He that dwellith in the teching,  hath bothe the sone and the fadir.
30636	63	1	10	If ony man cometh to you, and bryngith not this teching, nyle ye resseyue hym in to hous, nether seie ye to hym, Heil.
30637	63	1	11	For he that seith to hym, Heil, comyneth with hise yuel werkis. Lo! Y biforseide to you, that ye be not confoundid in the dai of oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
30638	63	1	12	Y haue mo thingis to write to you, and Y wolde not bi parchemyn and enke; for Y hope that Y schal come to you, and speke mouth to mouth, that your ioye be ful.
30639	63	1	13	The sones of thi chosun sistir greten thee wel. The grace of God be with thee. Amen.
30640	64	1	1	The eldere man to Gayus, most dere brother, whom Y loue in treuthe.
30641	64	1	2	Most dere brothir, of alle thingis Y make preyer, that thou entre, and fare welefuly, as thi soule doith welefuli.
30642	64	1	3	Y ioyede greetli, for britheren camen, and baren witnessing to thi treuthe, `as thou walkist in treuthe.
30643	64	1	4	Y haue not more grace of these thingis, than that Y here that my sones walke in treuthe.
30644	64	1	5	Most dere brother, thou doist feithfuli, what euer thou worchist in britheren, and that in to pilgrymys,
30645	64	1	6	which yeldiden witnessing to thi charite, in the siyt of the chirche; which thou leddist forth, and doist wel worthili to God.
30646	64	1	7	For thei wenten forth for his name, and token no thing of hethene men.
30647	64	1	8	Therfor we owen to resseyue siche, that we be euen worcheris of treuthe.
30648	64	1	9	I hadde write perauenture to the chirche, but this Diotrepes, that loueth to bere primacie in hem, resseyueth not vs.
30649	64	1	10	For this thing, if Y schal come, Y schal moneste hise werkis, whiche he doith, chidinge ayens vs with yuel wordis. And as if these thingis suffisen not to hym, nether he resseyueth britheren,  and forbedith hem that resseyuen, and puttith out of the chirche.
30650	64	1	11	Moost dere brothir, nyle thou sue yuel thing, but that that is good thing. He that doith wel, is of God; he that doith yuel, seeth not God.
30651	64	1	12	Witnessing is yoldun to Demetrie of alle men, and of treuthe it silf; but also we beren witnessing, and thou knowist, that oure witnessing is trewe.
30652	64	1	13	Y hadde many thingis to wryte to thee, but Y wolde not write to thee bi enke and penne.
30653	64	1	14	For Y hope soone to se thee, and we schulen speke mouth to mouth. Pees be to thee. Frendis greten thee wel. Greete thou wel frendis bi name.
30654	65	1	1	Judas, the seruaunt of Jhesu Crist, and brother of James, to these that ben louyd, that ben in God the fadir, and to hem that ben clepid and kept of Jhesu Crist,
30655	65	1	2	mercy, and pees, and charite be fillid to you.
30656	65	1	3	Moost dere britheren, Y doynge al bisynesse to write to you of youre comyn helthe, hadde nede to write to you, and preye to striue strongli for the feith that is onys takun to seyntis.
30657	65	1	4	For summe vnfeithful men priueli entriden, that sum tyme weren bifore writun in to this dom, and ouerturnen the grace of oure God in to letcherie, and denyen hym that is oneli a Lord, oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
30658	65	1	5	But Y wole moneste you onys, that witen alle thingis, that Jhesus sauyde his puple fro the lond of Egipt, and the secunde tyme loste hem that bileueden not.
30659	65	1	6	And he reseruede vndur derknesse aungels, that kepten not her prinshod, but forsoken her hous, in to the dom of the greet God, in to euerlastynge bondis.
30660	65	1	7	As Sodom, and Gomorre, and the nyy coostid citees, that in lijk maner diden fornycacioun, and yeden  awei aftir othir fleisch, and ben maad ensaumple, suffrynge peyne of euerelastinge fier.
30661	65	1	8	In lijk maner also these that defoulen the fleisch, and dispisen lordschip, and blasfemen mageste.
30662	65	1	9	Whanne Myyhel, arkaungel, disputide with the deuel, and stroof of Moises bodi, he was not hardi to brynge in dom of blasfemye, but seide, The Lord comaunde to thee.
30663	65	1	10	But these men blasfemen, what euer thingis thei knowen not. For what euer thingis thei knowen kyndli as doumbe beestis, in these thei ben corupt.
30664	65	1	11	Wo to hem that wenten the weie of Caym, and that ben sched out bi errour of Balaam for mede, and perischiden in the ayenseiyng of Chore.
30665	65	1	12	These ben in her metis, feestynge togidere to filthe, with out drede fedinge hemsilf. These ben cloudis with out watir, that ben borun aboute of the wyndis; heruest trees with out fruyt, twies deed, drawun vp bi the roote;

30667	65	1	14	But Enoch, the seuenthe fro Adam, profeciede of these, and seide, Lo! the Lord cometh with hise hooli thousandis,
30668	65	1	15	to do dom ayens alle men, and to repreue alle vnfeithful men of alle the werkis of the wickidnesse of hem, bi whiche thei diden wickidli, and of alle the harde wordis, that wyckid synneris han spoke ayens God.
30669	65	1	16	These ben grutcheris ful of pleyntis, wandrynge aftir her desiris; and the mouth of hem spekith pride,  worschipinge persoones, bi cause of wynnyng.

30683	66	1	5	that is a feithful witnesse, the firste bigetun of deed men, and prince of kingis of the erthe; which louyde vs, and waischide vs fro oure synnes in his blood,
30684	66	1	6	and made vs a kyngdom, and preestis to God and to his fader; to hym be glorie and empire in to worldis of worldis.
30685	66	1	7	Amen. Lo! he cometh with clowdis, and ech iye schal se hym, and thei that prickiden hym; and alle the kynredis of the erthe schulen beweile hem silf on hym.

30687	66	1	9	I, Joon, youre brothir, and partener in tribulacioun, and kingdom, and pacience in Crist Jhesu, was in an ile, that is clepid Pathmos, for the word of God, and for the witnessyng of Jhesu.
30688	66	1	10	Y was in spirit in the Lordis dai, and Y herde bihynde me a greet vois, as of a trumpe,
30689	66	1	11	seiynge to me, Write thou in a book that thing that thou seest, and sende to the seuene chirchis that ben in Asie; to Ephesus, to Smyrma, and to Pergamus, and to Tiatira, and to Sardis, and to Filadelfia, and to Loadicia.
30690	66	1	12	And Y turnede, that Y schulde se the vois that spak with me; and Y turnede, and Y say seuene candelstikis of gold,
30691	66	1	13	and in the myddil of the seuene goldun candelstikis oon lijk to the sone of man, clothid with a long garnement, and gird at the tetis with a goldun girdil.
30692	66	1	14	And the heed of hym and his heeris weren whijt, as whijt wolle, and as snow; and  the iyen of hym as flawme of fier,
30693	66	1	15	and hise feet lijk to latoun, as in a brennynge chymney; and the vois of hym as the vois of many watris.
30694	66	1	16	And he hadde in his riyt hoond seuene sterris, and a swerd scharp on euer ethir side wente out of his mouth; and his face as the sunne schyneth in his virtu.
30695	66	1	17	And whanne Y hadde seyn hym, Y felde doun at hise feet, as deed. And he puttide his riyt hond on me, and seide, Nyle thou drede; Y am the firste and the laste; and Y am alyue, and Y was deed;
30696	66	1	18	and lo! Y am lyuynge in to worldis of worldis, and Y haue the keyes of deth and of helle.
30697	66	1	19	Therfor write thou whiche thingis thou hast seyn, and whiche ben, and whiche it bihoueth to be don aftir these thingis.

30708	66	2	10	Drede thou no thing of these thingis, whiche thou schalt suffre. Lo! the deuel schal sende summe of you in to prisoun, that ye be temptid; and ye schulen haue tribulacioun ten daies. Be thou feithful to the deth, and Y schal yyue to thee a coroun of lijf.
30709	66	2	11	He that hath eeris, here he, what the spirit seith to the chirchis. He that ouercometh, schal not be hirt of the secounde deth.

30711	66	2	13	Y woot where thou dwellist, where the seete of Sathanas is; and thou holdist my name, and denyedist not my feith. And in tho daies was Antifas, my feithful witnesse, that was slayn at you, where Sathanas dwellith.
30712	66	2	14	But Y haue ayens thee a fewe thingis; for thou hast `there men holdinge the teching of Balaam,  which tauyte Balaac for to sende sclaundre bifor the sones of Israel, to ete of sacrificis of ydols, and to do fornicacioun;
30713	66	2	15	so also thou hast men holdinge the teching of Nycholaitis.
30714	66	2	16	Also do thou penaunce; `yif ony thing lesse, Y schal come soone to thee, and Y schal fiyte with hem with the swerd of my mouth.
30715	66	2	17	He that hath eeris, here he, what the spirit seith to the chirches. To him that ouercometh Y schal yyue aungel mete hid; and Y schal yyue to hym a whiit stoon, and in the stoon a newe name writun, which no man knowith, but he that takith.

30738	66	3	11	Lo! Y come soone; holde thou that that thou hast, that no man take thi coroun.
30739	66	3	12	And hym that schal ouercome, Y schal make a pilere in the temple of my God, and he schal no more go out; and Y schal write on hym the name of my God, and the name of the citee of my God, of the newe Jerusalem, that cometh doun fro heuene of my God, and my newe name.
30740	66	3	13	He that hath eeris, here he, what the spirit seith to the chirchis.

30751	66	4	2	Anoon Y was in spirit, and lo! a seete was sett in heuene, and vpon the seete oon sittynge.
30752	66	4	3	And he that sat, was lijk the siyt of a stoon iaspis, and to sardyn; and a reynbowe was in cumpas of the seete, lijk the siyt of smaragdyn.
30753	66	4	4	And in the cumpas of the seete weren foure and twenti smale seetis; and aboue the troones foure and twenti eldre men sittinge, hilid aboute with whijt clothis, and in the heedis of hem goldun corouns.
30754	66	4	5	And leitis, and voices, and thundringis camen out of the trone; and seuene laumpis brennynge bifore the trone, whiche ben the seuene spiritis of God.
30755	66	4	6	And bifor  the seete as a see of glas, lijk a crystal, and in the myddil of the seete, and in the cumpas of the seete, foure beestis ful of iyen bifore and bihynde.
30756	66	4	7	And the firste beeste lijk a lyoun; and the secounde beeste lijk a calf; and the thridde beeste hauynge a face as of a man; and the fourthe beeste lijk an egle fleynge.
30757	66	4	8	And the foure beestis hadden euery of hem sixe wyngis; and al aboute and with ynne thei weren ful of iyen; and thei hadden not reste dai and nyyt, seiynge, Hooli, hooli, hooli, the Lord God almyyti, that was, and that is, and that is to comynge.
30758	66	4	9	And whanne tho foure beestis yauen glorie, and honour, and blessing to hym that sat on the trone, that lyueth in to worldis of worldis,

30761	66	5	1	And Y say in the riythond of the sittere on the trone, a book writun with ynne and with out, and seelid with seuene seelis.
30762	66	5	2	And Y say a strong aungel, prechynge with a greet vois, Who is worthi to opene the book, and to vndon the seelis of it?

30765	66	5	5	And oon of the eldre men seide to me, Wepe thou not; lo! a lioun of the lynage of Juda, the  roote of Dauid, hath ouercomun to opene the book, and to vndon the seuene seelis of it.
30766	66	5	6	And Y say, and lo! in the myddil of the trone, and of the foure beestis, and in the myddil of the eldre men, a lombe stondynge as slayn, that hadde seuene hornes, and seuene iyen, whiche ben seuene spiritis of God, sent in to al the erthe.
30767	66	5	7	And he cam, and took of the riythond of the sittere in the trone the book.
30768	66	5	8	And whanne he hadde opened the book, the foure beestis and the foure and twenti eldre men fellen doun bifore the lomb; and hadden ech of hem harpis, and goldun violis ful of odours, whiche ben the preyeris of seyntis.
30769	66	5	9	And thei sungun a newe song, and seiden, Lord oure God, thou art worthi to take the book, and to opene the seelis of it; for thou were slayn, and ayenbouytist vs to God in thi blood, of ech lynage, `and tunge, and puple, and nacioun;
30770	66	5	10	and madist vs a kyngdom, and prestis to oure God; and we schulen regne on erthe.
30771	66	5	11	And Y say, and herde the vois of many aungels al aboute the trone, and of the beestis, and of the eldre men. And the noumbre of hem was thousyndis of thousyndis, seiynge with a greet vois,
30772	66	5	12	The lomb that was slayn, is worthi to take vertu, and godhed, and wisdom, and strengthe, and onour, and glorie, and blessing.
30773	66	5	13	And ech creature that is in heuene, and that is on erthe, and vndur erthe, and the see, and whiche thingis ben in it, Y herde alle seiynge, To hym that sat in the trone, and to the lomb, blessyng, and onour, and glorie, and power, in to worldis of worldis.
30774	66	5	14	And the foure beestis seiden, Amen. And  the foure and twenti eldre men fellen doun on her faces, and worschipiden hym that lyueth in to worldis of worldis.
30775	66	6	1	And Y sai, that the lomb hadde openyd oon of the seuene seelis. And Y herde oon of the foure beestis seiynge, as a vois of thundur, Come, and se.
30776	66	6	2	And Y sai, and lo! a white hors; and he that sat on hym hadde a bouwe, and a coroun was youun to hym. And he wente out ouercomynge, that he schulde ouercome.
30777	66	6	3	And whanne he hadde openyd the secounde seel, I herde the secounde beest seiynge, Come `thou, and se.
30778	66	6	4	And another reed hors wente out; and it was youun to hym that sat on hym, that he schulde take pees fro the erthe, and that thei sle to gidere hem silf; and a greet swerd was youun to hym.

30781	66	6	7	And whanne he hadde openyd the fourthe seel, Y herde a vois of the `foure beestis, seiynge, Come thou, and se.
30782	66	6	8	And lo! a pale hors; and the name was Deth to hym that sat on hym, and helle suede hym. And power was youun to hym on foure partis of the erthe, for to sle with swerd, and with hungur, and with deth, and with beestis of the erthe.
30783	66	6	9	And whanne he hadde opened the fyuethe seel, Y say vndur the auter the soulis of men slayn  for the word of God, and for the witnessing that thei hadden.
30784	66	6	10	And thei crieden with a geet vois, and seiden, Hou long thou, Lord, that art hooli and trewe, demest not, and vengest not oure blood of these that dwellen in the erthe?
30785	66	6	11	And white stoolis, for ech soule a stoole, weren youun to hem; and it was seide to hem, that thei schulden reste yit a litil tyme, til the noumbre of her felowis and of her britheren ben fulfillid, that ben to be slayn, as also thei.
30786	66	6	12	And Y say, whanne he hadde openyd the sixte seel, and lo! a greet erthe mouyng was maad; and the sunne was maad blak, as a sak of heire, and al the moone was maad as blood.
30787	66	6	13	And the sterris of heuene felden doun on the erthe, as a fige tre sendith his vnripe figis, whanne it is mouyd of a greet wynd.
30788	66	6	14	And heuene wente awei, as a book wlappid in; and alle munteyns and ilis weren mouyd fro her placis.
30789	66	6	15	And kingis of the erthe, and princis, and tribunes, and riche, and stronge, and ech bonde man, and freman, hidden hem in dennys and stoonys of hillis.
30790	66	6	16	And thei seien to hillis and to stoonys, Falle ye on vs, and hide ye vs fro the face of hym that sittith on the trone, and fro the wrath of the lomb;
30791	66	6	17	for the greet dai of her wraththe cometh, and who schal mowe stonde?
30792	66	7	1	Aftir these thingis Y sai foure aungels stondinge on the foure corneris of the erthe, holdinge foure wyndis of the erthe, that thei blewen not on the erthe, nether on the see, nether on ony tre.
30793	66	7	2	And Y sawy anothir aungel stiynge fro the risynge of the sunne, that hadde a signe of  the lyuynge God. And he criede with a greet vois to the foure aungels, to whiche it was youun to noye the erthe, and the see,
30794	66	7	3	and seide, Nyle ye noye the erthe, and see, nether trees, til we marken the seruauntis of oure God in the forhedis of hem.
30795	66	7	4	And I herde the noumbre of men that weren markid, an hundrid thousynde and foure and fourti thousynde markid, of euery lynage of the sones of Israel;
30796	66	7	5	of the lynage of Juda, twelue thousynde markid; of the lynage of Ruben, twelue thousynde markid; of the lynage of Gad, twelue thousynde markid;

30800	66	7	9	Aftir these thingis Y sai a greet puple, whom no man myyte noumbre, of alle folkis, and lynagis, and puplis, and langagis, stondinge bifore the trone, in the siyt of the lomb; and thei weren clothid with white stoolis, and palmes weren in the hondis of hem.
30801	66	7	10	And thei crieden with greet vois, and seiden, Heelthe to oure God, that sittith on the troone, and to the lombe.
30802	66	7	11	And alle aungels `stoden al aboute the trone, and the eldre men, and the foure beestis. And thei fellen doun in the  siyt of the trone, on her faces, and worschipiden God, and seiden, Amen!

30804	66	7	13	Amen. And oon of the senyours answerde, and seide to me, Who ben these, that ben clothid with white stoolis? and fro whennus came thei?
30805	66	7	14	And Y seide to hym, My lord, thou woost. And he seide to me, These ben thei, that camen fro greet tribulacioun, and waischiden her stoolis, and maden hem white in the blood of the lomb.
30806	66	7	15	Therfor thei ben bifor the trone of God, and seruen to hym dai and niyt, in his temple. And he that sittith in the trone, dwellith on hem.
30807	66	7	16	Thei schulen no more hungur, nether thirste, nether sunne schal falle on hem, ne ony heete.
30808	66	7	17	For the lomb, that is in the myddil of the trone, schal gouerne hem, and schal lede forth hem to the wellis of watris of lijf; and God schal wipe awei ech teer fro the iyen of hem.
30809	66	8	1	And whanne he hadde openyd the seuenthe seel, a silence was maad in heuene, as half an our.
30810	66	8	2	And Y say seuene aungels stondinge in the siyt of God, and seuene trumpis weren youun to hem.
30811	66	8	3	And another aungel cam, and stood bifor the auter, and hadde a goldun censer; and many encencis weren youun to hym, that he schulde yyue of the preiers of alle seyntis on the goldun auter, that is bifor the trone of God.
30812	66	8	4	And the smoke of encencis of the preiers of the hooli men stiede vp fro the aungels hoond bifor God.
30813	66	8	5	And the aungel took the censere, and fillide it of the fier of the auter, and  castide in to the erthe. And thundris, and voices, and leityngis weren maad, and a greet erthe mouyng.
30814	66	8	6	And the seuene aungels, that hadden seuene trumpis, maden hem redi, that thei schulden trumpe.
30815	66	8	7	And the firste aungel trumpide; and hail was maad, and fier meynd togidere in blood; and it was sent in to the erthe. And the thridde part of the erthe was brent, and the thridde part of trees was brent, and al the green gras was brent.
30816	66	8	8	And the secunde aungel trumpide; and as a greet hil brennynge with fier was cast in to the see;
30817	66	8	9	and the thridde part of the see was maad blood, and the thridde part of creature was deed, that hadde lyues in the see, and the thridde part of schippis perischide.
30818	66	8	10	And the thridde aungel trumpide; and a greet sterre brennynge as a litil brond, felle fro heuene; and it felle in to the thridde part of floodis, and in to the wellis of watris.
30819	66	8	11	And the name of the sterre is seid Wormod. And the thridde part of watris was maad in to wormod; and many men weren deed of the watris, for tho weren maad bittere.
30820	66	8	12	And the fourthe aungel trumpide; and the thridde part of the sunne was smytun, and the thridde part of the moone, and the thridde part of sterris, so that the thridde part of hem was derkid, and the thridde part of the dai schynede not, and also of the nyyt.
30821	66	8	13	And Y say, and herde the vois of an egle fleynge bi the myddil of heuene, and seiynge with a greet vois, Wo! wo! wo! to men that dwellen in erthe, of the othir voices of thre aungels, that schulen trumpe aftir.
30822	66	9	1	And the fyuethe aungel trumpide; and Y say, that a sterre hadde falle doun fro heuene in to erthe; and the keye of the pit of depnesse was youun to it.
30823	66	9	2	And it openede the pit of depnesse, and a smoke of the pit stiede vp, as the smoke of a greet furneis; and the sunne was derkid, and the eir, of the smoke of the pit.
30824	66	9	3	And locustis wenten out of the smoke of the pit in to erthe; and power was youun to hem, as scorpiouns of the erthe han power.
30825	66	9	4	And it was comaundid to hem, that thei schulden not hirte the gras of erthe, nether ony grene thing, nether ony tre, but oneli men, that han not the signe of God in her forhedis.
30826	66	9	5	And it was youun to hem, that thei schulden not sle hem, but that thei schulden `be turmentid fyue monethis; and the turmentyng of hem, as the turmentyng of a scorpioun, whanne he smytith a man.
30827	66	9	6	And in tho daies men schulen seke deth, and thei schulen not fynde it; and thei schulen desire to die, and deth schal fle fro hem.
30828	66	9	7	And the licnesse of locustis ben lijk horsis maad redi `in to batel; and on the heedis of hem as corouns lijk gold, and the facis of hem as the faces of men.
30829	66	9	8	And thei hadden heeris, as heeris of wymmen; and the teeth of hem weren as teeth of liouns.
30830	66	9	9	And thei hadden haburiouns, as yren haburiouns, and the vois of her wengis as the vois of charis of many horsis rennynge `in to batel.
30831	66	9	10	And thei hadden tailis lijk scorpiouns, and prickis weren in the tailis of hem; and the myyt of hem was to noye men fyue monethis.
30832	66	9	11	And thei hadden on hem a kyng, the aungel of depnesse, to whom the name bi Ebrew is Laabadon, but bi Greek Appollion, and bi Latyn `he hath a name `Extermynans, that is, a distriere.
30833	66	9	12	O wo is passid, and lo! yit comen twei woes.
30834	66	9	13	Aftir these thingis also the sixte aungel trumpide; and Y herde a vois fro foure corneris of the goldun auter, that is bifore the iyen of God,
30835	66	9	14	and seide to the sixte aungel that hadde a trumpe, Vnbynde thou foure aungels, that ben boundun in the greet flood Eufrates.
30836	66	9	15	And the foure aungels weren vnboundun, whiche weren redi in to our, and dai, and monethe, and yeer, to sle the thridde part of men.
30837	66	9	16	And the noumbre of the oost of horse men was twenti thousynde sithis ten thousynde. Y herde the noumbre of hem.
30838	66	9	17	And so Y say horsis in visioun; and thei that saten on hem hadden firy haburiouns, and of iacynt, and of brymstoon. And the heedis of the horsis weren as heedis of liouns; and fier, and smoke, and brymston, cometh forth of the mouth of hem.
30839	66	9	18	Of these thre plagis the thridde part of men was slayn, of the fier, and of the smoke, and of the brymston, that camen out of the mouth of hem.
30840	66	9	19	For the power of the horsis is in the mouth of hem, and in the tailis of hem; for the tailis of hem ben lyk to serpentis, hauynge heedis, and in hem thei noyen.
30841	66	9	20	And the tothir men, that weren not slayn in these plagis, nether dyden penaunce of the werkis of her hondis, that thei worschipeden not deuelis, and simylacris of gold,  and of siluer, and of bras, and of stoon, and of tre, whiche nethir mown se, nether heere, nether wandre;
30842	66	9	21	and diden not penaunce of her mansleyngis, nether of her witchecraftis, nethir of her fornicacioun, nethir of her theftis, weren slayn.
30843	66	10	1	And Y say another stronge aungel comynge doun fro heuene, clothid with a cloude, and the reynbowe on his heed; and the face of him was as the sunne, and the feet of hym as a piler of fier.
30844	66	10	2	And he hadde in his hoond a litil book openyd; and he sette his riyt foot on the see, and the left foot on the erthe.
30845	66	10	3	And he criede with a greet vois, as a lioun whanne he roreth; and whanne he hadde cried, the seuene thundris spaken her voicis.
30846	66	10	4	And whanne the seuene thundris hadden spoken her voicis, Y was to writynge. And Y herde a vois fro heuene, seiynge, Marke thou what thingis the seuene thundris spaken, and nyle thou write hem.
30847	66	10	5	And the aungel whom Y say stondinge aboue the see, and aboue the erthe, lifte vp his hond to heuene,
30848	66	10	6	and swoor bi hym that lyueth in to worldis of worldis, that maad of nouyt heuene, and tho thingis whiche ben in it, and the erthe, and tho thingis that ben in it, and the see, and tho thingis that ben in it, that time schal no more be.
30849	66	10	7	But in the daies of the vois of the seuenethe aungel, whanne he schal bigynne to trumpe, the mysterie of God schal be endid, as he prechide bi hise seruauntis prophetis.
30850	66	10	8	And Y herde a vois fro heuene eftsoone spekynge with me, and seiynge, Go thou, and take the book, that is openyd, fro the hoond of  the aungel, that stondith aboue the see, and on the lond.
30851	66	10	9	And Y wente to the aungel, and seide to hym, that he schulde yyue me the book. And he seide to me, Take the book, and deuoure it; and it schal make thi wombe to be bittir, but in thi mouth it schal be swete as hony.
30852	66	10	10	And Y took the book of the aungels hond, and deuouride it, and it was in my mouth as swete hony; and whanne Y hadde deuourid it, my wombe was bittere. And he seide to me, It bihoueth thee eftsoone to prophesie to hethene men, and to puplis, and langagis, and to many kingis.
30853	66	11	1	And a reed lijk a yerde was youun to me, and it was seid to me, Rise thou, and meete the temple of God, and the auter, and men that worschipen in it.
30854	66	11	2	But caste thou out the foryerd, that is with out the temple, and mete not it; for it is youun to hethene men, and thei schulen defoule the hooli citee bi fourti monethis and tweyne.
30855	66	11	3	And Y schal yyue `to my twey witnessis, and thei schulen prophesie a thousynde daies two hundrid and sixti, and schulen be clothid with sackis.
30856	66	11	4	These ben tweyne olyues, and twei candilstikis, and thei stonden in the siyt of the Lord of the erthe.
30857	66	11	5	And if ony man wole anoye hem, fier schal go out of the mouth of hem, and schal deuoure her enemyes. And if ony wole hirte hem, thus it bihoueth hym to be slayn.
30858	66	11	6	These han power to close heuene, that it reyne not in the daies of her prophesie; and thei han power on watris, to turne hem in to blood; and to smyte the erthe with euery plage, and as ofte as thei wolen.
30859	66	11	7	And whanne thei schulen  ende her witnessing, the beeste that stieth vp fro depnesse, schal make batel ayens hem, and schal ouercome hem, and schal sle hem.
30860	66	11	8	And the bodies of hem schulen ligge in the stretis of the greet citee, that is clepid goostli Sodom, and Egipt, where the Lord of hem was crucified.
30861	66	11	9	And summe of lynagis, and of puplis, and of langagis, and of hethene men, schulen se the bodies of hem bi thre daies and an half; and thei schulen not suffre the bodies of hem to be put in biriels.
30862	66	11	10	And men enhabitynge the erthe schulen haue ioye on hem; and thei schulen make myrie, and schulen sende yiftis togidere, for these twei prophetis turmentiden hem that dwellen on the erthe.
30863	66	11	11	And aftir thre daies and an half, the spirit of lijf of God entride in to hem; and thei stoden on her feet, and greet dreed felle on hem that sayn hem.
30864	66	11	12	And thei herden a greet vois fro heuene, seiynge to hem, Come vp hidir. And thei stieden in to heuene in a cloude, and the enemyes of hem sayn hem.
30865	66	11	13	And in that our a greet erthe mouyng was maad, and the tenthe part of the citee felle doun; and the names of men seuene thousynde weren slayn in the erthe mouyng; and the tother weren sent in to drede, and yauen glorie to God of heuene.
30866	66	11	14	The secounde wo is gon, and lo! the thridde wo schal come soone.

30869	66	11	17	and seiden, We don thankyngis to thee, Lord God almyyti, which art, and which were, and which art to comynge; which hast takun thi greet vertu, and hast regned.
30870	66	11	18	And folkis ben wrooth, and thi wraththe cam, and tyme of dede men to be demyd, and to yelde mede to thi seruauntis, and prophetis, and halewis, and dredynge thi name, to smale and to grete, and to distrie hem that corrumpiden the erthe.
30871	66	12	19	And the temple of God in heuene was openyd, and the arke of his testament was seyn in his temple; and leityngis weren maad, and voices, and thondris, and `erthe mouyng, and greet hail.
30872	66	12	1	And a greet signe apperide in heuene; a womman clothid with the sunne, and the moone vndur hir feet, and in the heed of hir a coroun of twelue sterris.

30875	66	12	4	And the tail of hym drow the thridde part of sterris of heuene, and sente hem in to the erthe. And the dragoun stood bifore the womman, that was to berynge child, that whanne sche hadde borun child, he schulde deuoure hir sone.
30876	66	12	5	And sche bar a knaue child, that was to reulinge alle folkis in an yrun yerde; and hir sone was rauyschid to God, and  to his trone.
30877	66	12	6	And the womman flei in to wildirnesse, where sche hath a place maad redi of God, that he fede hir there a thousynde daies two hundrid and sixti.
30878	66	12	7	And a greet batel was maad in heuene, and Myyhel and hise aungels fouyten with the dragoun. And the dragoun fauyt, and hise aungels;
30879	66	12	8	and thei hadden not myyt, nether the place of hem was foundun more in heuene.
30880	66	12	9	And thilke dragoun was cast doun, the greet elde serpent, that is clepid the Deuel, and Sathanas, that disseyueth al the world; he was cast doun in to the erthe, and hise aungels weren sent with hym.
30881	66	12	10	And Y herde a greet vois in heuene, seiynge, Now is maad helthe, and vertu, and kyngdom of oure God, and the power of his Crist; for the accuser of oure britheren is cast doun, which accuside hem bifor the siyte of oure God dai and nyyt.
30882	66	12	11	And thei ouercamen hym for the blood of the lomb, and for the word of his witnessing; and thei louyden not her lyues til to deth.
30883	66	12	12	Therfor, ye heuenes, be ye glad, and ye that dwellen in hem. Wo to the erthe, and to the see; for the fend is come doun to you, and hath greet wraththe, witynge that he hath litil tyme.
30884	66	12	13	And after that the dragoun sai, that he was cast doun to the erthe, he pursuede the womman, that bare the knaue child.
30885	66	12	14	And twei wengis of a greet egle weren youun to the womman, that sche schulde flee in to deseert, in to hir place, where sche is fed by tyme, and tymes, and half a tyme, fro the face of the serpent.
30886	66	12	15	And the serpent sente out of his mouth aftir the womman watir as a flood, that he schulde make hir to be drawun of the flood.
30887	66	12	16	And the erthe  helpide the womman, and the erthe openyde his mouth, and soop up the flood, that the dragoun sente of his mouth.
30888	66	12	17	And the dragoun was wrooth ayens the womman, and he wente to make batel with othere of hir seed, that kepen the maundementis of God, and han the witnessing of Jhesu Crist.
30889	66	12	18	And he stood on the grauel of the see.
30890	66	13	1	And Y sai a beeste stiynge vp of the see, hauynge seuene heedis, and ten hornes; and on hise hornes ten diademes, and on hise heedis the names of blasfemye.
30891	66	13	2	And the beeste, whom Y sai, was lijk a pard, and hise feet as the feet of a beere, and his mouth as the mouth of a lioun; and the dragoun yaf his vertu and greet power to hym.
30892	66	13	3	And Y sai oon of hise heedis, as slayn in to deth; and the wounde of his deth was curid. And al erthe wondride after the beeste.
30893	66	13	4	And thei worschipiden the dragoun, that yaf power to the beeste; and thei worschipeden the beeste, and seiden, Who is lijk the beeste, and who schal mowe fiyte with it?
30894	66	13	5	And a mouth spekynge grete thingis, and blasfemyes, was youun `to it; and power was youun to it, to do two and fourti monethis.
30895	66	13	6	And it openyde his mouth in to blasfemyes to God, to blasfeme his name, and his tabernacle, and hem that dwellen in heuene.
30896	66	13	7	And it was youun to hym to make batel with seyntis, and to ouercome hem; and power was youun to hym in to ech lynage, and puple, and langage, and folk.
30897	66	13	8	And alle men worschipiden it, that dwellen in erthe, whos names ben not writun in the book of lijf of the  lomb, that was slayn fro the bigynnyng of the world.
30898	66	13	9	If ony man hath eeris, here he.
30899	66	13	10	He that ledith in to caitifte, schal go in to caitifte; he that sleeth with swerd, it bihoueth hym to be slayn with swerd. This is the pacience and the feith of seyntis.
30900	66	13	11	And Y sai another beeste stiynge vp fro the erthe, and it hadde two hornes, lijk the lomb; and it spak as the dragoun,
30901	66	13	12	and dide al the power of the formere beeste, in his siyt. And it made the erthe, and men dwellinge in it, to worschipe the firste beeste, whos wounde of deth was curid.
30902	66	13	13	And it dide grete signes, that also it made fier to come doun fro heuene in to the erthe, in the siyt of alle men.
30903	66	13	14	And it disseyueth men, that dwellen in erthe, for signes whiche ben youun `to it to do in the siyt of the beeste; seiynge to men dwellinge in erthe, that thei make an ymage of the beeste, that hath the wounde of swerd, and lyuede.
30904	66	13	15	And it was youun to hym, that he schulde yyue spirit to the ymage of the beeste, and that the ymage of the beeste speke. And he schal make, that who euere honouren not the ymage of the beeste, be slayn.
30905	66	13	16	And he schal make alle, smale and grete, and riche and pore, and fre men and bonde men, to haue a carecter in her riythoond, ethir in her forheedis; that no man may bie,
30906	66	13	17	ethir sille, but thei han the caracter, ether the name of the beeste, ethir the noumbre of his name.
30907	66	13	18	Here is wisdom; he that hath vndurstonding, acounte the noumbre of the beeste; for it is the noumbre of man, and his noumbre is sixe hundrid sixti and sixe.
30908	66	14	1	And Y sai, and lo! lomb stood on the mount of Sion, and with hym an hundrid thousynde and foure and fourti thousynde, hauynge his name, and the name of his fadir writun in her forhedis.
30909	66	14	2	And Y herde a vois fro heuene, as the vois of many watris, and as the vois of a greet thundur; and the vois which is herd, was as of many harperis harpinge in her harpis.
30910	66	14	3	And thei sungun as a newe song bifor the seete of God, and bifore the foure beestis, and senyouris. And no man miyte seie the song, but thei an hundrid thousynde and foure and fourti thousynde, that ben bouyt fro the erthe.
30911	66	14	4	These it ben, that ben not defoulid with wymmen; for thei ben virgyns. These suen the lomb, whidir euer he schal go; these ben bouyt of alle men, the firste fruytis to God, and to the lomb;
30912	66	14	5	and in the mouth of hem lesyng is not foundun; for thei ben with out wem bifor the trone of God.
30913	66	14	6	And Y say another aungel, fliynge bi the myddil of heuene, hauynge an euerlastinge gospel, that he schulde preche to men sittynge on erthe, and on ech folk, and lynage, and langage, and puple;
30914	66	14	7	and seide with a greet vois, Drede ye the Lord, and yyue ye to hym onour, for the our of his dom cometh; and worschipe ye hym, that made heuene and erthe, the see, and alle thingis that ben in hem, and the wellis of watris.
30915	66	14	8	And anothir aungel suede, seiynge, Thilke greet Babiloyne fel doun, fel doun, which yaf drinke to alle folkis of the wyn of wraththe of her fornycacioun.
30916	66	14	9	And the thridde aungel suede hem, and seide with  a greet vois, If ony man worschipe the beeste, and the ymage of it, and takith the carecter in his forheed, ether in his hoond,
30917	66	14	10	this schal drynke of the wyn of Goddis wraththe, that is meynd with clere wyn in the cuppe of his wraththe, and schal be turmentid with fier and brymston, in the siyt of hooli aungels, and bifore the siyt of the lomb.
30918	66	14	11	And the smoke of her turmentis schal stie vp in to the worldis of worldis; nether thei han reste dai and niyt, whiche worschipiden the beeste and his ymage, and yf ony man take the carect of his name.
30919	66	14	12	Here is the pacience of seyntis, whiche kepen the maundementis of God, and the feith of Jhesu.
30920	66	14	13	And Y herde a vois fro heuene, seiynge to me, Write thou, Blessid ben deed men, that dien in the Lord; fro hennus forth now the spirit seith, that thei reste of her traueilis; for the werkis of hem suen hem.
30921	66	14	14	And Y say, and lo! a white cloude, and aboue the cloude a sittere, lijk the sone of man, hauynge in his heed a goldun coroun, and in his hond a scharp sikil.
30922	66	14	15	And another aungel wente out of the temple, and criede with greet vois to hym that sat on the cloude, Sende thi sikil, and repe, for the our cometh, that it be ropun; for the corn of the erthe is ripe.
30923	66	14	16	And he that sat on the cloude, sente his sikil in to the erthe, and rap the erthe.
30924	66	14	17	And another aungel wente out of the temple, that is in heuene, and he also hadde a scharp sikile.
30925	66	14	18	And another aungel wente out fro the auter, that hadde power on fier and water; and he criede with a greet vois to hym that hadde the scharp sikil, and seide, Sende thi scharp  sikil, and kitte awei the clustris of the vynyerd of the erthe, for the grapis of it ben ripe.
30926	66	14	19	And the aungel sente his sikil in to the erthe, and gaderide grapis of the vynyerd of the erthe, and sente into the greet lake of Goddis wraththe.
30927	66	14	20	And the lake was troddun without the citee, and the blood wente out of the lake til to the `bridels of horsis, bi furlongis a thousynd and six hundrid.
30928	66	15	1	And Y say another signe in heuene, greet and wondurful; seuene aungels hauynge `seuene the laste veniauncis, for the wraththe of God is endid in hem.
30929	66	15	2	And Y say as a glasun see meynd with fier, and hem that ouercamen the beeste, and his ymage, and the noumbre of his name, stondynge aboue the glasun see, hauynge the harpis of God;
30930	66	15	3	and syngynge the song of Moises, the seruaunt of God, and the song of the lomb, and seiden, Grete and wondurful ben thi werkis, Lord God almyyti; thi weies ben iust and trewe, Lord, kyng of worldis.
30931	66	15	4	Lord, who schal not drede thee, and magnyfie thi name? for thou aloone art merciful; for alle folkis schulen come, and worschipe in thi siyt, for thi domes ben open.
30932	66	15	5	And aftir these thingis Y say, and lo! the temple of the tabernacle of witnessyng was opened in heuene;
30933	66	15	6	and seuene aungels hauynge seuene plagis, wenten out of the temple, and weren clothid with a stoon clene and white, and weren bifor gird with goldun girdlis about the brestis.
30934	66	15	7	And oon of the foure beestis yaf to the seuene aungels seuene goldun viols, ful of the wraththe of God, that lyueth in to  worldis of worldis.
30935	66	15	8	And the temple was fillid with smooke of the majestee of God, and of the vertu of hym; and no man myyte entre in to the temple, til the seuene plagis of seuene angels weren endid.
30936	66	16	1	And Y herde a greet vois fro heuene, seiynge to the seuene aungels, Go ye, and schede out the seuene viols of Goddis wraththe in to erthe.
30937	66	16	2	And the firste aungel wente, and schedde out his viol in to the erthe; and a wounde fers and werst was maad on alle that hadden the carect of the beeste, and on hem that worschipiden the beeste, and his ymage.
30938	66	16	3	And the secounde aungel schedde out his viol in to the see, and the blood was maad, as of a deed thing; and ech man lyuynge was deed in the see.
30939	66	16	4	And the thridde aungel schedde out his viol on the floodis, and on the wellis of watris, and seide,
30940	66	16	5	Just art thou, Lord, that art, and that were hooli, that demest these thingis;
30941	66	16	6	for thei schedden out the blood of halewis and prophetis, and thou hast youun to hem blood to drinke; for thei ben worthi.
30942	66	16	7	And I herde anothir seiynge, Yhe! Lord God almiyti, trewe and iust ben thi domes.
30943	66	16	8	And the fourthe aungel schedde out his viol in to the sunne, and it was youun to hym to turmente men with heete and fier.
30944	66	16	9	And men swaliden with greet heete, and blasfemyden the name of God hauynge power on these plagis, nether thei diden penaunce, that thei schulden yyue glorie to hym.
30945	66	16	10	And the fifte aungel schedde out his viol on the seete of the beeste, and his kyngdom was maad derk; and thei eten togidere her tungis for sorewe,
30946	66	16	11	and thei  blasfemyden God of heuene, for sorewis of her woundis; and thei diden not penaunce of her werkis.
30947	66	16	12	And the sixte aungel schedde out his viol in `that ilke greet flood Eufratis, and driede the watir of it, that weie were maad redi to kingis fro the sunne rysyng.
30948	66	16	13	And Y say thre vnclene spiritis bi the manner of froggis go out of the mouth of the dragoun, and of the mouth of the beeste, and of the mouth of the fals prophete.
30949	66	16	14	For thei ben spiritis of deuels, makynge signes, and thei gon forth to kingis of al erthe, to gadere hem in to batel, to the greet dai of almiyti God.
30950	66	16	15	Lo! Y come, as a niyt theefe. Blessid is he that wakith, and kepith hise clothis, that he wandre not nakid, and that thei se not the filthhed of hym.
30951	66	16	16	And he schal gadre hem in to a place, that is clepid in Ebreu Hermagedon.
30952	66	16	17	And the seuenthe aungel schedde out his viol in to the eyr, and a greet vois wente out of heuene fro the trone, and seide, It is don.
30953	66	16	18	And leityngis weren maad, and voices, and thundris; and a greet erthe mouyng was maad, which manere neuere was, sithen men weren on erthe, siche `erthe mouyng so greet.
30954	66	16	19	And the greet citee was maad in to thre parties, and the citees of hethene men felden doun; and greet Babiloyne cam in to mynde byfor God, to yyue to it the cuppe of wyn of the indignacyoun of his wraththe.
30955	66	16	20	And ech ile flei awei, and hillis ben not foundun.
30956	66	16	21	And greet hail as a talent cam doun fro heuene in to men; and men blasfemyden God, for the plage of hail, for it was maad ful greet.
30957	66	17	1	And oon of the seuene aungels cam, that hadde seuene viols, and spak with me, and seide, Come thou, Y schal schewe to thee the dampnacioun of the greet hoore, that sittith on many watris, with which kyngis of erthe diden fornicacioun;
30958	66	17	2	and thei that dwellen in the erthe ben maad drunkun of the wyn of her letcherie.
30959	66	17	3	And he took me in to desert in spirit. And Y say a womman sittynge on a reed beeste, ful of names of blasfemye, hauynge seuene heedis, and ten hornes.
30960	66	17	4	And the womman was enuyround with purpur, and reed, and ouergild with gold, and preciouse stoon, and peerls, hauynge a goldun cuppe in hir hoond, ful of abhomynaciouns and vnclennesse of her fornycacioun.
30961	66	17	5	And a name writun in the forheed of hir, Mysterie, Babiloyn the greet, modir of fornycaciouns, and of abhomynaciouns of erthe.
30962	66	17	6	And Y say a womman drunkun of the blood of seyntis, and of the blood of martris of Jhesu. And whanne Y say hir, Y wondride with greet wondryng.
30963	66	17	7	And the aungel seide to me, Whi wondrist thou? I schal seie to thee the sacrament yf the womman, and of the beeste that berith hir, that hath seuene heedis and ten hornes.
30964	66	17	8	The beeste which thou seist, was, and is not; and sche schal stie fro depnesse, and sche schal go `in to perisching. And men dwellinge in erthe schulen wondre, whos names ben not writun in the book of lijf fro the makinge of the world, seynge the beeste, that was, and is not.
30965	66	17	9	And this is the witt, who that hath wisdom. The seuene heedis ben seuene hillis, on  whiche the womman sittith, and kyngis seuene ben.
30966	66	17	10	Fyue han feld doun, oon is, and anothir cometh not yit. And whanne he schal come, it bihoueth hym to dwelle a schort tyme.
30967	66	17	11	And the beeste that was, and is not, and sche is the eiytthe, and is of the seuene, and schal go in to perischyng.
30968	66	17	12	And the ten hornes whiche thou hast seyn, ben ten kyngis, that yit han not take kyngdom; but thei schulen take power as kingis, oon our after the beeste.
30969	66	17	13	These han a counsel, and schulen bitake her vertu and power to the beeste.
30970	66	17	14	These schulen fiyte with the lomb, and the lomb schal ouercome hem; for he is Lord of lordis, and kyng of kyngis; and thei that ben with hym, ben clepid, chosun, and feithful.
30971	66	17	15	And he seide to me, The watris whiche thou hast seyn, where the hoore sittith, ben puplis, and folkis, and langagis.
30972	66	17	16	And the ten hornes that thou hast seyn in the beeste, these schulen make hir desolat and nakid, and schulen ete the fleischis of hir, and schulen brenne togidere hir with fier.
30973	66	17	17	For God yaf in to the hertis of hem, that thei do that that is pleasaunt to hym, that thei yyue her kyngdom to the beeste, til the wordis of God ben endid.
30974	66	17	18	And the womman whom thou hast seyn, is the greet citee, that hath kingdom on kyngis of the erthe.
30975	66	18	1	And aftir these thingis Y siy another aungel comynge doun fro heuene, hauynge greet power; and the erthe was liytned of his glorie.
30976	66	18	2	`And he criede with strong vois, `and seide, Greet Babiloyn felde doun, felde doun, and is maad the habitacioun of deuelis, and the keping of ech vnclene spirit, and `the  keping of ech vnclene foul, and hateful.
30977	66	18	3	For alle folkis drunkun of the wraththe of fornycacioun of hir, and kingis of the erthe, and marchauntis of the erthe, diden fornycacioun with hir; and thei ben maad riche of the vertu of delices of hir.
30978	66	18	4	And Y herde another vois of heuene, seiynge, My puple, go ye out of it, and be ye not parceneris of the trespassis of it, and ye schulen not resseyue of the woundis of it.
30979	66	18	5	For the synnes of it camen `til to heuene, and the Lord hadde mynde of the wickidnesse of it.
30980	66	18	6	Yelde ye to it, as sche yeldide to you; and double ye double thingis, aftir her werkis; in the drynke that she meddlid to you, mynge ye double to hir.
30981	66	18	7	As myche as sche glorifiede hir silf, and was in delicis, so myche turment yyue to hir, and weilyng; for in hir herte sche seith, Y sitte a queen, and Y am not a widewe, and Y schal not se weiling.
30982	66	18	8	And therfor in o day hir woundis schulen come, deth, and mornyng, and hungur; and sche schal be brent in fier, for God is strong, that schal deme hir.
30983	66	18	9	And the kingis of the erthe schulen biwepe, and biweile hem silf on hir, whiche diden fornicacioun with hir, and lyueden in delicis, whanne thei schulen se the smoke of the brennyng of it;
30984	66	18	10	stondynge fer, for drede of the turmentis of it, and seiynge, Wo! wo! wo! thilke greet citee Babiloyn, and thilke stronge citee; for in oon our thi dom cometh.
30985	66	18	11	And marchauntis of the erthe schulen wepe on it, and morne, for no man schal bie more the marchaundise of hem;

30988	66	18	14	And thin applis of the desire of thi lijf wenten awei fro thee, and alle fatte thingis, and ful clere perischiden fro thee.
30989	66	18	15	And marchaundis of these thingis schulen no more fynde tho thingis. Thei that ben maad riche of it, schulen stonde fer, for drede of turmentis of it, wepynge, and mornynge, and seiynge, Wo!

30995	66	18	21	And o stronge aungel took vp a stoon, as a greet mylne stoon, and keste in to the  see, and seide, In this bire thilke greet citee Babiloyn schal be sent, and now it schal no more be foundun.

31002	66	19	4	And the foure and twenti senyouris and foure beestis felden doun, and worschipiden God sittynge on the trone, and seiden, Amen, Alleluya.
31003	66	19	5	And a vois wente out of the trone, and seide, Alle the seruauntis of oure God, seie ye heriyngus to oure God, and ye that dreden God, smale and grete.
31004	66	19	6	And Y herde a vois of a grete trumpe, as the vois of many watris, and as the vois of grete thundris, seiynge, Alleluya; for  oure Lord God almyyti hath regned.

31007	66	19	9	And he seide to me, Write thou, Blessid ben thei that ben clepid to the soper of weddyngis of the lomb. And he seide to me, These wordis of God ben trewe.
31008	66	19	10	And Y felde doun bifore hise feet, to worschipe hym. And he seide to me, Se thou, that thou do not; Y am a seruaunt with thee, and of thi britheren, hauynge the witnessyng of Jhesu; worschipe thou God. For the witnessing of Jhesu is spirit of profesie.
31009	66	19	11	And Y say heuene openyd, and lo! a whit hors, and he that sat on hym was clepid Feithful and sothefast; and with riytwisnesse he demeth, and fiytith.
31010	66	19	12	And `the iyen of hym weren as flawme of fier, and in his heed many diademys; and he hadde a name writun, which no man knew, but he.
31011	66	19	13	And he was clothid in a cloth spreynt with blood; and the name of hym was clepid The sone of God.
31012	66	19	14	And the oostis that ben in heuene, sueden hym on white horsis, clothid with bissyn, white and clene.
31013	66	19	15	And a swerd scharp on ech side cam forth of his mouth, that with it he smyte folkis; and he shal reule hem with an yren yerde. And he tredith the pressour of wyn of stronge veniaunce of the wraththe of almyyti God.
31014	66	19	16	And he hath writun in his cloth, and in the hemme, Kyng of kyngis and Lord of lordis.
31015	66	19	17	And Y say an aungel, stondynge in the sunne; and he criede with  greet vois, and seide to alle briddis that flowen bi the myddil of heuene, Come ye, and be ye gaderid to the greet soper of God,

31017	66	19	19	And Y sai the beeste, and the kyngis of the erthe, and the oostis of hem gaderid, to make batel with hym, that sat on the hors, and with his oost.
31018	66	19	20	And the beeste was cauyt, and with hir the false prophete, that made signes bifor hir; in whiche he disseyuede hem that token the carect of the beeste, and that worschipiden the ymage of it. These tweyne weren sent quyke in to the pool of fier, brennynge with brymstoon.
31019	66	19	21	And the othere weren slayn of swerd of hym that sat on the hors, that cometh forth of the mouth of hym; and alle briddis weren fillid with the fleisch of hem.
31020	66	20	1	And Y say an aungel comynge doun fro heuene, hauynge the keie of depnesse, and a greet chayne in his hoond.
31021	66	20	2	And he cauyte the dragoun, the elde serpent, that is the deuel and Sathanas; and he boonde hym bi a thousynde yeeris.
31022	66	20	3	And he sente hym `in to depnesse, and closide on hym, that he disseyue no more the folkis, til a thousynde yeeris be fillid. Aftir these thingis it bihoueth hym to be vnboundun a litil tyme.
31023	66	20	4	And Y say seetis, and thei saten on hem, and doom was youun to hem. And the soulis of men biheedid for the witnessyng of Jhesu,  and for the word of God, and hem that worschipiden not the beeste, nether the ymage of it, nethir token the carect of it in her forheedis, nethir in her hoondis. And thei lyueden, and regneden with Crist a thousynde yeeris.
31024	66	20	5	Othere of deed men lyueden not, til a thousynde yeeris ben endid. This is the first ayen risynge.
31025	66	20	6	Blessid and hooli is he, that hath part in the firste ayenrysyng. In these men the secunde deth hath not power; but thei schulen be prestis of God, and of Crist, and thei schulen regne with hym a thousynde yeeris.
31026	66	20	7	And whanne a thousynde yeeris schulen be endid, Sathanas schal be vnboundun of his prisoun; and he schal go out, and schal disseyue folkis, that ben on foure corners of the erthe, Gog and Magog. And he schal gadere hem in to batel, whos noumbre is as the grauel of the see.
31027	66	20	8	And thei stieden vp on the broodnesse of erthe, and enuyrounede the castels of seyntis, and the louyd citee.
31028	66	20	9	And fier cam doun `of God fro heuene, and deuourede hem. And the deuel, that disseyuede hem, was sent in to the pool of fier and of brymston,
31029	66	20	10	where bothe the beeste and fals prophetis schulen be turmentid dai and niyt, in to worldis of worldis.
31030	66	20	11	Amen. And Y say a greet white trone, and oon sittynge on it, fro whos siyt erthe fled and heuene; and the place is not foundun `of hem.
31031	66	20	12	And Y sai deed men, grete and smale, stondynge in the siyt of the trone; and bookis weren opened, and deed men weren demed of these thingis that weren writun in the bookis, aftir the werkis of hem.
31032	66	20	13	And the see yaf his deed men, that weren in it; and deth and helle  yauen her deed men, that weren in hem. And it was demed of ech, aftir the werkis of hem.
31033	66	20	14	And helle and deth weren sent in to a poole of fier. `This is the secunde deth.
31034	66	20	15	And he that was not foundun writun in the book of lijf, was sent in to the pool of fier.
31035	66	21	1	And Y sai newe heuene and newe erthe; for the firste heuene and the firste erthe wenten awei, and the see is not now.
31036	66	21	2	And Y Joon say the hooli citee Jerusalem, newe, comynge doun fro heuene, maad redi of God, as a wijf ourned to hir hosebonde.
31037	66	21	3	And Y herde a greet vois fro the trone, seiynge, Lo! the tabernacle of God is with men, and he schal dwelle with hem; and thei schulen be his puple, and he God with hem schal be her God.
31038	66	21	4	And God schal wipe awei ech teer fro the iyen of hem; and deth schal no more be, nether mornyng, nether criyng, nether sorewe schal be ouer; whiche `firste thingis wenten awei.
31039	66	21	5	And he seide, that sat in the trone, Lo! Y make alle thingis newe. And he seide to me, Write thou, for these wordis ben moost feithful and trewe.
31040	66	21	6	And he seide to me, It is don; I am alpha and oo, the bigynnyng and ende. Y schal yyue freli of the welle of quic watir to hym that thirsteth.
31041	66	21	7	He that schal ouercome, schal welde these things; and Y schal be God to hym, and he schal be sone to me.
31042	66	21	8	But to ferdful men, and vnbileueful, and cursid, and manquelleris, and fornycatouris, and to witchis, and worschiperis of idols, and to alle lieris, the part of hem shal be in the pool brennynge with fier and brymstoon, that is the secounde deth.
31043	66	21	9	And oon cam of the seuene aungels,  hauynge violis fulle of `seuene the laste veniauncis. And he spak with me, and seide, Come thou, and Y schal schewe to thee the spousesse, the wijf of the lomb.
31044	66	21	10	And he took me vp in spirit in to a greet hille and hiy; and he schewide to me the hooli citee Jerusalem, comynge doun fro heuene of God,
31045	66	21	11	hauynge the clerete of God; and the liyt of it lijk a preciouse stoon, as the stoon iaspis, as cristal.
31046	66	21	12	And it hadde a walle greet and hiy, hauynge twelue yatis, and in the yatis of it twelue aungels, and names writun in, that ben the names of twelue lynagis of the sones of Israel; fro the east thre yatis,
31047	66	21	13	and fro the north thre yatis, and fro the south thre yatis, and fro the west thre yatis.
31048	66	21	14	And the wal of the citee hadde twelue foundementis, and in hem the twelue names of twelue apostlis, and of the lomb.
31049	66	21	15	And he that spak with me, hadde a goldun mesure of a rehed, that he schulde mete the citee, and the yatis of it, and the wal.
31050	66	21	16	And the citee was set in square; and the lengthe of it is so miche, `as miche as is the breede. And he mat the citee with the rehed, bi furlongis twelue thousyndis. And the heiythe, and the lengthe and breede of it, ben euene.
31051	66	21	17	And he mat the wallis of it, of an hundrid and `foure and fourti cubitis, bi mesure of man, that is, of an aungel.
31052	66	21	18	And the bildyng of the wal therof was of the stoon iaspis. And the citee it silf was clene gold, lijk clene glas.
31053	66	21	19	And the foundementis of the wal of the citee weren ourned with al preciouse stoon. The firste foundement, iaspis; the secounde, safiris; the thridde, calcedonyus; the fourthe, smaragdus;

31055	66	21	21	And twelue yatis ben twelue margaritis, bi ech; `and ech yate was of ech margarete. And the stretis of the citee weren clene gold, as of glas ful schynynge.
31056	66	21	22	And Y say no temple in it, for the Lord God almyyti and the lomb, is temple of it.
31057	66	21	23	And the citee hath no nede of sunne, nethir moone, that thei schyne in it; for the clerete of God schal liytne it; and the lomb is the lanterne of it.
31058	66	21	24	And folkis schulen walke in liyt of it; and the kyngis of the erthe schulen brynge her glorie and onour in to it.
31059	66	21	25	And the yatis of it schulen not be closid bi dai; and niyt schal not be there.
31060	66	21	26	And thei schulen brynge the glorie and onour of folkis in to it.
31061	66	21	27	Nether ony man defoulid, and doynge abhominacioun and leesyng, schal entre in to it; but thei that ben writun in the book of lijf and of the lomb.
31062	66	22	1	And he schewide to me a flood of quic watir, schinynge as cristal, comynge forth of the seete of God, and of the lomb,
31063	66	22	2	in the myddil of the street of it. And on ech side of the flood, the tree of lijf, bryngynge forth twelue fruytis, yeldinge his fruit bi ech monethe; and the leeues of the tree ben to heelthe of folkis.
31064	66	22	3	And ech cursid thing schal no more be; but the seetis of God and of the lomb schulen be in it. And the seruauntis of hym schulen serue to hym.
31065	66	22	4	And thei schulen see his face, and his name in her forheedis.
31066	66	22	5	And niyt schal no more be, and thei schulen not haue nede to the  liyt of lanterne, nethir to liyt of sunne; for the Lord God schal lyytne hem, and thei schulen regne in to worldis of worldis.
31067	66	22	6	And he seide to me, These wordis ben moost feithful and trewe. And the Lord God of spiritis of prophetis sente his aungel, to schewe his seruauntis, what thingis it bihoueth to be don soone.
31068	66	22	7	`And lo! Y come swiftli. Blessid is he, that kepith the wordis of prophesie of this book.
